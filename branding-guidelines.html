<h1 class="title">API Evangelist Branding Guidelines</h1>
<p>As your brand grows, you need to work harder to protect the integrity of your brand, and in the world of APIs it is common for providers to have a branding guidelines page. As I enter the fourth year of existence with API Evangelist, and I begin to get more recognition across the US, and the worl, it makes sense to start helping understand best practices for using API Evangelist branding.</p>
<h2>API Evangelist Logo</h2>
<p>Let's start with the official API Evangelist logo. Even though this logo was entirely by accident, the result of me having zero graphic design skills, it has become a significant part of brand, and recognizable because of the t-shirts I wear when on the road. I do not mind if you print the logo on any t-shirt you please.</p>

<p>However when you are wearing the API Evangelist logo, be respectful, and make sure the logo is always in clear view of all viwers. Your out of control hipster, or hippie beard should not block the logo at any point.</p>

<h2>API Evangelist Image</h2>
<p>Now let's work with the image of me as the API Evangelist. I would have never commissioned something like this, but a talented fan in Paris drew it of me, and it has also become associated with my brand, used for a variety of online profiles, t-shirts, and stickers.</p>
<p>The API Evangelist image is perfect as a sticker, and can easily be applied to any of the places you enjoy putting stickers, such as your car, or possible on the front of your Macbook Pro!</p>

<p>However when it is not acceptable to ever get a tattoo of API Evangelist anywhere on your body, it would just be way to creepy for me, and just really sad, pathetic for you.</p>

<p style="color: #FF0000;" align="center"><strong>UNACCEPTABLE USE OF API EVANGELIST IMAGE!!</strong></p><br />
<p>When it comes down to you, just use the API Evangelist logo, and image in sensible ways, that aren't going to make me look bad. I want you to help spread the good API word, but please don't make me look like an ass!!</p>
<p>I appreciate you helping protect my brand, and following all of the API Evangelist branding guidelines.</p>
