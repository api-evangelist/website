<h1>Curated API News for Week of August 15th, 2016</h1>
<p>This is what I digested for the week of August 15th, 2016, influencing my writing, and reflecting what was I tuned into for the week. You can download a JSON listing of these links using the JSON icon to the right.</p>
<ul>
{% for tag in site.data.curated.08-15-2016 %}
  {% assign thistag = tag[0] %}
  {% assign thisentry = tag[1] %}
  <li>
    <strong>{{ thistag }}</strong>
    <ul>
    {% for entry in thisentry %}
      <li><a href="{{ entry.link }}" target="_blank">{{ entry.title }}</a> (<i>{{ entry.domain }}</i>)</li>
    {% endfor %}
    </ul>
  </li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
<p>These links come from across the blogs, and Twitter accounts I monitor across the API space, and from my research across the sector. You can access a master list of all weeks on the <a href="/weekly/curated/">main page</a>.</p>
