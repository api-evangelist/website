# API Evangelist 

I am working to make sense to the technology, business and politics of APIs.

The website no longer runs on GitHub, but I am keeping this repository up to manage the conversation and other details around the operation of the network of sites.

Feel free to submit issues, and contribute any links via GitHub issues, Twitter, or email.
