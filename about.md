# About API Evangelist

<a href="http://github.com"><img align="right" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-github.jpg" width="200" style="padding: 15px;" /></a>

[API Evangelist](http://apievangelist.com) began in July 2010 as an open research project on the API space, and specifically, the business of APIs.  

In 2013, API Evangelist is still an open research project on the API space, but I've just gotten better at the whole process.

This entire website is an open source repository, that you can [view, fork or download on Github](https://github.com/kinlane/api-evangelist/tree/gh-pages), living as a Github repository.

You are viewing this Github repository on the web using [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/), using a process I call [Hacker Storytelling](http://hackerstorytelling.com).

Everything you find in this repository is licensed [CC BY-SA 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/), so you can use everything here, as long as provide attribution back, and open license anything you derive from it.

All I ask is you make sure, you use the logo at the top of this site, with a link back to my work wherever you use this content.  

My name is [Kin Lane](http://kinlane.com)([@kinlane](https://twitter.com/kinlane)), I am the API Evangelist, and I'm looking to educate the world about the technology, business and politics of APIs.

Thank you for supporting, and I hope you find as much value in this research as I do.
