<p>I welcome you to contact me, with any specific questions, but I would like to offer you some advice to help you make sure your messages are received, and get a proper response.</p>
<p>I spend a good amount of time focusing on my research, which means I'm not always tuned into my phone, email inbox, and Twitter accounts. It helps to understand my workflow, and choose the best path possible for you to reach out.</p>

<p>As a one person operation, I do my best to keep up with the channels listed above, but there are some weeks where I'm focused on research, coding, and writing, and may ot always be available.</p>
<p>I appreciate your interest, and looking forward to talking more.</p>
