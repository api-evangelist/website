<p><span>My Weekly API.Report represents the best of what I've read throughout the week, and is only what I personally felt should be showcased. Each news item comes with a link, and some thoughts I had after curating the piece of API related news. I'm trying to break down stories into as coherent buckets as I can, but it remains something that is ever changing for me, but ultimately I will settle on a clear definition for each of the research areas.</span></p>
<p>Always a good report, when I start with <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>101</strong></span>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://sproutsocial.com/insights/what-is-an-api/">What Is an API, and Why Does It Matter?</a> - I love coming across other introductory to API material. The space if getting so wide, that there are many good opinions emerging.</li>
</ul>
<p>More on the legal side of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>3D Printing</strong></span>, than API:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.strategy-business.com/blog/Past-Dangers-Can-Protect-You-from-Future-Threats">Protecting IP from 3D Printing: What Companies Need to Know</a> - An interesting thought on IP from 3D printing world. Something that will keep heating up in coming years.</li>
</ul>
<p>An interesting <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Account Management</strong></span> feature:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://backendless.com/feature-81-changing-users-password-via-api-if-user-can-login/">Feature 81: Changing user&rsquo;s password via API (if user can login)</a> - I am doing a lot of tracking on how APIs are being used to help manage user and developer accounts.</li>
</ul>
<p>A handful of interesting <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Acquisitions</strong></span> to note:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://venturebeat.com/2015/04/01/salesforce-buys-mobile-authentication-startup-toopher/">Salesforce buys mobile authentication startup Toopher</a> - Buying up the bits and pieces you need for your mobile strategy.</li>

</ul>
<p>I'm see more <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Analytics</strong></span> related items like this focused on gaming lately:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/news/google-player-analytics-provides-android-developers-gaming-insight/2015/04/02">Google Player Analytics Provides Android Developers Gaming Insight&nbsp;</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I'm calling these <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>API Aggregation</strong></span>, but they are kind of a new take on the topic:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.alchemyapi.com/api/combined/urls.html">AlchemyAPI Web Combined Call</a> - I thought this was an interesting approach to monetizing APIs, by saving developers time. In a world where you have a bunch of microservices that do one thing, and do it well, I think aggregate or combined API calls ike this as premium service will be more common.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/api/alchemyapi-text-combined-call">AlchemyAPI Text Combined Call</a> - Seems to be something they are doing across the board. Will keep an eye out for others doing this too.</li>
</ul>
