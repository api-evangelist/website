<p>3D printing and manufacturing platform <a title="Shapeways" href="http://www.shapeways.com">Shapeways</a>, provides a <a title="marketplace for designers" href="http://www.shapeways.com/shops">marketplace for their designers</a> to sell their products, and also <a title="provides a set of widgets" href="http://www.shapeways.com/blog/archives/830-Promoting-Your-Shop-With-The-Shapeways-Widget.html">provides a set of widgets</a> for users to promote the products they've created and published to their Shapeways shop.
<p>The Shapeways widgets is a classic example of why RESTful APIs are so powerful.
<p>Shapeway employs an iFrame widget where users can enter their shop name, and customize the number of rows and columns, and the height and width of the widget.
