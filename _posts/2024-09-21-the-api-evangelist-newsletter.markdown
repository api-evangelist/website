[I am firing up the API Evangelist newsletter again](https://buttondown.com/apievangelist). I switched services and decided to completely reboot my subscriber list from scratch with this new era. I had quite a list from before, but like social media and other areas I feel starting anew helps rebuild in more meaningful ways. The newsletter will be weekly, and this round it will be more of a narrative from me about what I read, wrote, and worked on from the previous week—letting folks cherry pick what matters to them.

I fully understand that it is impossible to read everything I write and keep up with all the projects I have going on at any given moment. I am hoping that if you read anything, it will be this one piece that ends up in your inbox-—then who knows, you may find something that catches your attention and wasn’t able to be found during the weekly noise. I rarely have an editorial strategy for the week—-I just write and publish what matters to me at the moment. I will count on the writing in the newsletter to assess how well I did for the week and align me week over week.

While I still use an RSS reader I am actually more optimistic about the future of email when it comes to communication. I know we all don't read everything in our inbox, but I know that I tend to read what matters at any given moment. I am hoping this newsletter will become a nice way that people can still tune into what I am working on without having to be bombarded with the noise that exists on the web and via social media in 2024. I am enjoying picking up the momentum again with API Evangelist and finding which channels that matter, while I get to write about exactly what I personally think matters in the very noisy and distorted world of APIs, but specifically API governance (guidance).
