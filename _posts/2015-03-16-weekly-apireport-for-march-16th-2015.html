<p>Phew!! This week was hard. I just couldn't find the mojo to plow through, but I did it. A little late on Monday evening, but still so worth doing--putting the week into perspective.</p>
<p>I'm still trying to assess the best balance with what I post as individual news stories on <a href="http://api.report">API.Report</a>. I think more of this could be pulled out as actual news stories, but will have to see if I have the time. Overall I am happy with how the weekly API.Report is evolving, but there is so much more I could do.</p>
<p><span>The Weekly API.Report represents the best of what I've read throughout the week, and is only what I personally felt should be showcased. Each news item comes with a link, and some thoughts I had after curating the piece of API related news. I'm trying to break down stories into as coherent buckets as I can, but it remains something that is ever changing for me, but ultimately I will settle on a clear definition for each of the research areas.</span></p>
<p>I track on a lot of <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3D Printing</span></strong>, but few of them are directly API related, finallky one that moves the conversation forward:</p>
