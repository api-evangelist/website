<p>Does anyone else notice the evolution of the <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/">Twitter developer area</a>? The site has taken a page from the LinkedIn playbook and become more about embeddable buttons, badges and widgets than about APIs. &nbsp;

<p>Granted, you can click on documentation and get at the REST API v 1.1. &nbsp;I'm not saying this is a good or bad thing. &nbsp;I'm a big supporter of embeddable strategies for API providers. I think that evolution is very telling of Twitter's API strategy and what type of "developer" they want to support with the API.
<p>Whether or not you agree with Twitter's overall API strategy, there is a lot to learn from their approach to API driven embeddable tools. &nbsp;I will produce more pieces aobut their approach to cards, timelines, buttons and other embeddable tools.
