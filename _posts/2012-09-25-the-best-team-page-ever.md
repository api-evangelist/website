{% include JB/setup %}<p>When it comes to any business, you want to showcase your team, and the value they bring to the table.  One of the things I do here at API Evangelist, is showcase great examples of technology across the API industry.  With this in mind I wanted to showcase the Singly team page. When you visit singly.com and click on team in the footer, you get immediately see a team member photo carousel: Which isnt very unique, but next you get 3 things that are unique: Average number of hours each Singly team member slept this week Number of Github commits in the last 7 days Distance walked by Singly team members Singly team members provide this data using Quantified Self (QS) data from products like Fitbit and Runkeeper, and social programming networks like Github--driven by APIs.</p>
