Since 2010 I have had a page on this site dedicated to "API Management". In 2013 the API universe expanded, and I've broken my work in this area into three separate, open source API research projects.

  * **[Design**][1]
  * **[Deployment**][2]
  * **[Management**][3]

I'm grouping these projects under a single umbrella, I'm now calling "[providing APIs][4]". If you are a company or organization looking to provide API driven resources to partners, the public or even use them for internal operations, this section is for you.

I will be adding several other API research areas in the near future, including:

  * Monetization
  * Evangelism
  * Security
  * Embeddable

For each of the projects you will find building blocks, companies, tools, news and analysis. All projects stick to my new [Hacker Storytelling][5] format, making sure my research is open, distributable and machine readable.
