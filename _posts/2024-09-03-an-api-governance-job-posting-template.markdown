I have been mulling over everything I found included in the five API governance job posts I came across the previous week. As I said, there was a lot being asked across those job posts, and the way qualifications, responsibilities, and skills were used was bothering me--they are very jumbled. The other thing that really bothered me was how all of the  job postings focused on it being this single persons job to do everything as opposed to them being the definer, facilitator, coordinator, and communicator with other business and engineering stakeholders to do the work. This will be the reason 90% of the API governance efforts fail in the enterprise--it is up to one person to enforce change, and not everyone across the enterprise to step up and contribute to the change.

Here is my current template for anyone looking to post a job opening for someone to lead API governance. It is still too much, and I suggest trimming it down a bit, picking and choosing what really matters to you and your organization. I have tried to keep qualifications, responsibilities, and skills distinct, while also adding a goals section to provide some direction.

I spent the last week aligning this with my own API governance as a service strategy, and I will work to regularly update it with my latest thinking. I strongly encourage folks who are hiring for this role to make sure they are properly equipping and supporting the individual they bring on, while also making sure other stakeholders know they are accountable and on the hook for contributing and being the change desired with setting API governance in motion. Another important aspect that I will work on is how do you not just educate leadership about API governance, but actually get them involved in defining and evolving the strategy, and actively contributing to API policies--without this, API governance will never be properly aligned with business goals.

I would also like to do this for API product managers. I will keep an eye out for job postings and do the same work I've done here for API governance. I feel the same way as I did when I left Postman--that API governance and API product management are the two most important roles for leading the API changed needed for enterprises over the next decade. Hopefully this job posting template for an API governance lead helps you in your enterprise API journey, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need help along the way. I am happy to bring in expertise to help you at the strategic and program level as well as at the API contract and tactical level. I won't be applying for an API governance jobs moving forward, but I am here to be your fractional API governance lead, and provide governance as a services whenever you need. Just let me know how I can help.
