XML <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/">APIs</a> were part of Salesforce.com from day one.  Salesforce.com identified that customers needed to share data across their different business applications, and APIs were the way to do this.<p></p>
Marc R. Benioff, chairman and founder of salesforce.com stated, <em>"Salesforce.com is the first solution that truly leverages the Internet to offer the functionality of enterprise-class software at a mere fraction of the cost."</em><p></p>
