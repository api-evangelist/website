<p>I finished up the&nbsp;<a title="Mashery" href="http://www.mashery.com">Mashery</a>, <a title="Business of APIs Conference" href="http://apiconference.com/">Business of APIs (BAPI) Conference</a> in San Francisco on Tuesday. &nbsp;After a days rest and reflection on the event I wanted to capture my thoughts on BAPI - SF. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The turnout was impressive. &nbsp;I got to see a lot of familiar faces, was introduced to some new APIs and met a few new folks looking to transform their businesses using APIs. &nbsp;</p>
<p>On the 16 presentations I saw, here are some of my thoughts:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/events/business-of-apis-2011/daniel.JPG" alt="" width="175" align="right" />
<li><strong>Daniel Jacobson</strong> - I have seen Daniel talk several times, so I'm familiar with his talk, but he adds new slides each time. &nbsp;Always love seeing how they are solving internal and partner needs with their APIs, as well helping them achieve world domination using APIs and the Amazon cloud.</li>
<li><strong>Adam Trachtenberg</strong> - There were three things I took away from listening to Andy. &nbsp;1) Your API should get all the same love and attention as your primary business. &nbsp;2) &nbsp;Hold Hackathons within your own company to encourage innovation 3) LinkedIn is a model of how any API should employ embeddable buttons and widgets around their API.</li>
<li><strong>Steve Citron-Poust</strong> - &nbsp;I need to watch his pitch again. &nbsp;His speaking style was engaging so I was drawn in by his perspective of ecosystem management, and didn't take good enough notes. &nbsp;He offers a very realist perspective of managing your developers, and the differences in managing a private-label, partner API platform.</li>
<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/events/business-of-apis-2011/john-musser-2.JPG" alt="" width="225" align="right" />
<li><strong>John Musser</strong> - John always has a very concise view of the entire API industry, showing the growth, and helping us understand the scope and depth of this growth. &nbsp;ProgrammableWeb recently hit 4K APIs in its directory, showing some phenomenal growth in number of APIs, but also by industry, and varying ways companies are monetizing their APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Neel Ketkar</strong> - Neel from Rovi talked about the advantages of an open API, and the importance of providing a feedback framework for your developers and incorporating feedback into your roadmap. &nbsp;Neel also urged the importance of having a flexible API infrastructure allowing for change, because you will have to continually evolve how you deliver your services. &nbsp;But one nugget I walked away with, that I'm evolving as separate story, is "arming your corporate sales team with APIs", how this can be a very empowering differentiator.</li>
<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/events/business-of-apis-2011/klout.JPG" alt="" width="175" align="right" />
<li><strong>Tyler Singletary</strong> -  Tyler takes home the grand prize for the most relevant presentation, reflecting the mission of the event, which is the Business of APIs. &nbsp;His presenation is fulll of valuable insights into how to approach your API business model, how it relates to your TOS and branding guidelines. &nbsp;I'm working on a completely separate story about Tylers presentation at BAPI.</li>
<li><strong>Marie Alexander</strong> -  Unfortunately I don't have much feedback on the fireside chat with Marie from Quova. &nbsp;I ran out of power, because Mashery didn't have power plugs for press(:(), so I went out of room to charge and ended up talking to other folks.</li>
<li><strong>Ben Metcalfe</strong> - I think Ben offers some very realistic advice for API owners, that is grounded in actual experience in bulding and implementing API strategy for small and enterprise level businesses. &nbsp; I need to talk to Ben more about what his Swordfi.sh company offers.</li>
<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/events/business-of-apis-2011/abraham.JPG" alt="" width="175" align="right" />
<li><strong>Abraham Williams</strong> -  Thoroughly entertained by Abrahams presention on Unicorns (developers), and how to manage and encourage them within your community. &nbsp;I've seen his pitch a couple times and it gets more polished each time. &nbsp;I don't want to call his talk "the basics", I think "the essentials", is more appropriate. &nbsp;Every business looking to launch an API should watch his talk.</li>
<li><strong>Seth Blank</strong> -  I'm am super excited by any talk that can use the words Fuck and API together so much. &nbsp;He had a very colorful presentation about what developers love and hate about APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Dave Carroll</strong> - Dave is the extremely wise and cool uncle of the API space. &nbsp;Saleforce is one of the elders in the space, and Dave has been there the whole time, so he gets it at a level I think many of us can't quite see. &nbsp;He demonstrates the important role APIs have played in current and future sucess of Salesforce.</li>
<li><strong>Ryan Sarver</strong> - Ryan gave a very polished view of Twitter and its API ecosystem. &nbsp;I don't think Victoria asked the hard questions, but we got some insight into how they view their often troubled developer ecosystem, and what Twitter would like to see. &nbsp;I'm uploading a video I took of his talk, and will post a separate post about it after I watch again.</li>
<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/events/business-of-apis-2011/jeff2.JPG" alt="" width="200" align="right" />
<li><strong>Jeff Lawson</strong> -  Always love watching Jeff give a talk. &nbsp;I've seen this one 3 times now, but he shoots from the hip and evolves it each time. &nbsp;So much to learn from Twilio, but the nugget I walked away with this time was APIs should have a self-service model, as well as a sales funnel for approach enterprise sales. &nbsp;Its a model that works well across the board, not just the enterprise.</li>
<li><strong>Reeve S. Thompson</strong> - Ok, was totally blown by the Cabana mobile app builder. &nbsp;I talked with Reeve Thompson for a bit, and looking forward to talking more. &nbsp;They build a mobile app using both the Twitter and Klout API in 300 seconds, live during the demo. &nbsp;They are the vision I was talking about in&nbsp;<a title="Widget Building Platform for APIs" href="/2011/06/22/widget-builder-environment-for-apis/">Widget Builder Environment for APIs</a>, but for mobile. &nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall BAPI was a great experience, except for that one dude I spilled a glass of water on his leg. &nbsp;So sorry man!!</p>
<p>I'm really looking forward to the New York&nbsp;<a title="New York event October 19th" href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/2025693905?ref=ebtn">New York event October 19th</a> and if I can afford to, I will be going to the&nbsp;<a title="London event October 25th" href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/2025746061?ref=ebtn">London event on October 25th</a>. &nbsp;If you want to help <a title="Audrey Watters" href="http://www.hackeducation.com/">Audrey</a> and I get there, let me know! &nbsp;:)</p>
<p>I'm still working on a couple other side stories from the event, I will post them when they are ready. &nbsp;The registration is still open for both events. I highly recommend getting to at least one of them if you can.</p>
