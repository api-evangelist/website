{% include JB/setup %}<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/google-url-shortner-logo.jpg"  width="250" align="right" />Google launched a much anticipated API for the Google URL shortener today as part of the <a href="http://code.google.com/labs/">Google Code Labs</a>.
The Google URL Shortener at goo.gl is a service that takes long URLs and squeezes them into fewer characters to make a link that is easier to share, tweet, or email to friends.
The Google URL Shortener API allows you to interact with the service via a RESTful interface, and returns JSON data structures. Here is the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/urlshortener/overview.html">API Overview</a>, as well as the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/urlshortener/v1/getting_started.html">Getting Started Guide</a>.
Google has added to its new API console allowing developers to explore and get familiar with the API interface quickly.
