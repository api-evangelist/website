The Twitter API has come a long ways since the early days of the microblogging service.  Even though Twitter now has a sexy dashboard with an organized set of building blocks, I would file the API under accidental ecosystem.<p></p>
I think the Twitter ecosystem was largely built by the community itself, and not necessarily by Twitter.  Twitter is one API I wish I had reviewed several years ago so I could compare their earlier approach to how it is being served up today.<p></p>
Twitter‘s API uses the following building blocks:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Dashboard</li>
	<li>Getting Started</li>
	<li>Documentation</li>
	<li>Client Libraries / Code Samples</li>
	<li>Widgets &amp; Buttons</li>
</ul>
Twitter supports the API community through:<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/Twitter-Logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Forum</li>
	<li>Blog</li>
	<li>Announcments</li>
	<li>Mailing List</li>
	<li>IRC</li>
	<li>API Status Dashboard</li>
	<li>(and of course) a Twitter Account!</li>
</ul>
Twitter works to protect its brand with:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Guidelines</li>
	<li>Rate Limits</li>
	<li>Terms and Conditions</li>
	<li>Branding and Display Guidelines</li>
</ul>
I only see one simple outreach to the Twitter development community:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Dev for Hire</li>
</ul>
You can't ignore how far the Twitter API has come.  Twitter has added new features to its API, including geolocation, as well as giving developers better updates on the API status.  Even more importantly, Twitter recently <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2010/09/better-twitter.html">redesigned its website</a> and now uses its own API to drive it.<p></p>
Even with all of this progress Twitter still has a way to go.<p></p>
Developers and business people have invested a lot of time and money in using and integrating Twitter.  Twitter should acknowledge this effort more through partner and developer building blocks that bring the community closer.  This is a major gap I see in the Twitter API community.<p></p>
With a little more outreach, partner and developer support, Twitter could go the extra mile and truly create a healthy and vibrant ecosystem around its API.
