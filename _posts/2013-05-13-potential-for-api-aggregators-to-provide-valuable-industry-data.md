{% include JB/setup %}<p>Ive been tracking on a trend in the API space that I call API aggregation.Companies like Singly and Adigami are aggregating APIs into more meaningful API stacks, than any single API provider can deliver on their own.In my regular monitoring, Im always on the hunt for examples of the benefits of API Aggregation, and last week I saw some pretty interesting payment gateway data being provided by payment API aggregator Spreedly--which definitely reflects the positive effects Im looking to shine light on in the space.  Spreedly is a cloud based credit card vault that allows you to work with one or multiple payment gateways over time or simultaneously, and has published some pretty interesting analysis of failed transaction rates across multiple payment gateways.Ill let you head over to Spreedly to read the analysis.</p>
