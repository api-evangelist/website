<a title="Rdio" href="http://www.rdio.com/"><img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/rdio-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a><a title="Rdio" href="http://www.rdio.com/">Rdio</a> is a music streaming service, where users can access music via the web or mobile phone for a monthly fee.<p>
Using <a title="Mashery" href="http://www.mashery.com">Mashery</a>, Rdio provides a RESTful API where you can do just about anything you can trough the web interface.<p>
Rdio provides a pretty significant incentive for their developers, in the form of revenue sharing.<p>
Developers of the <a title="Rdio API" href="http://developer.rdio.com/">Rdio API</a> can earn recurring revenue each month for every new subscriber recruited through their application.<p>
Also developers can earn revenue each time someone purchases and downloads an MP3 file from the service.<p>
Through the <a title="Rdio Affiliate Program" href="https://cli.linksynergy.com/cli/publisher/registration/registration.php?mid=36727">Rdio Affiliate Program</a> developers can earn from between 2% and 7% for purchases made within a 30-day cookie window.<p>
Having an API affiliate program seems like a logical way to incentivize developers to build applications.<p>
An API owner should have an established monetization strategy for their API, and it should outline how revenue will be generated.<p>
Having a way to track and attribute sales to your API developers makes a lot of sense, and sharing revenue with developers will ensure they will keep building new ways to attract users to a service via the API.
