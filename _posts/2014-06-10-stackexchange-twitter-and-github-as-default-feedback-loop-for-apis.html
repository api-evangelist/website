<p>I&rsquo;m still mining great examples of API design, deployment, and management that other API providers can follow, from recent API projects out of <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">18F</a> with&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/08/18f-shows-what-is-possible-in-government-with-fbopen-api/">FBOpen</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/04/another-strong-api-implementation-in-federal-government-with-openfda/">OpenFDA out of the Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA).</a></p>
<p>This time it is the approach to establishing the critical API feedback loop with consumers from OpenFDA. Via the<a href="https://open.fda.gov/"> OpenFDA portal,</a> API consumers can seek help via three self-service channels:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="https://github.com/FDA">GitHub</a></li>
<li><a href="http://opendata.stackexchange.com/search?q=openFDA">StackExchange</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23openfda">Twitter</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t get your question answered by searching through existing Github, StackExchange, and Twitter conversations, you have three ways to directly ask the OpenFDA team questions:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="https://opendata.stackexchange.com/questions/ask?tags=openFDA">StackExchange</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/FDA">GitHub</a></li>
<li>Email</li>
</ul>
<p>What is notable (thanks Gray Brooks), is that OpenFDA uses existing services to establish the feedback loop with API consumers&mdash;meaning they use Github, StackExchange, and Twitter rather than rolling their own tool. OpenFDA understands that there are existing conversation that are already occurring on StackExchange, and developers are used to going here to find the answers they need.</p>
<p>Additionally by stimulating the conversation on StackExchange and Twitter you are generating valuable social media and SEO exhaust that will help new consumers, potentially learn about an API and how it is being used by developers.  This type of feedback loop doesn&rsquo;t just provide support for community, it establishes itself as the heartbeat of your API, showing that someone is home, and there to support and listen.</p>
<p>The best part is that using Twitter, StackExchange, and Github are free for public conversations, and take almost no time to setup. OpenFDA directly links to asking a question form on StackExchange, they don&rsquo;t for Github, but could. They also directly link to #OpenFDA hashtag to join existing conversations on StackExchange and Twitter, which is a pretty slick way to weave searches into your API feedback loop.</p>
<p>Lots of good patterns to follow, from the leading groups deploying APIs in the US federal government.</p>
