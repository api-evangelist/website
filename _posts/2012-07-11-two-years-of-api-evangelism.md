<p>I started my research on the API industry two years ago this month.  In July 2010 I was looking for the next step, and thought the API space might be it, but I wanted to do my homework before I made the switch.   So I spent a month studying where the API space was, and where it was going.</p>
<p>I saw that web APIs had found its roots in sales and e-commerce with API pioneers like <a title="Salesforce" href="/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-salesforce-com/">Salesforce</a>, <a title="Amazon" href="/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-amazon-e-commerce/">Amazon</a> and <a title="ebay" href="/2011/01/26/history-of-apis-ebay/">eBay</a>.  Then quickly gained momentum with social APIs like Delicious and <a title="Flickr" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/02/09/history-of-apis-flickr-api/">Flickr</a>, then <a title="Twitter" href="/2011/01/26/history-of-apis-twitter/">Twitter</a> and <a title="Facebook" href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-facebook-development-platform/">Facebook</a>.  But social was still more hobby than business, and it wasn&rsquo;t until Amazon started deploying storage and compute infrastructure using web APIs, is when it got real.</p>
<p>In summer of 2010 I couldn&rsquo;t see anything but mobile.  Understanding the importance of APIs when it comes to mobile app development, I knew that APIs would play a significant role in the future.  But what role could I play?  How could I contribute?</p>
<p>There were plenty of extremely smart RESTful pundits or <a title="RESTafarians" href="http://mikeschinkel.com/blog/whatisarestafarian/">RESTafarians</a> as Mike says. I was capable of playing here, but saw an area I could focus on, and that was the business of APIs.  Successful APIs aren&rsquo;t just technical, there are a lot to consider on the business and marketing side of things.</p>
<p>So in August 2010 I bought apievangelist.com, then by October I was blogging about my research in the space.  Two years later I&rsquo;m still blogging about the business of APIs and monitoring the space.  But I&rsquo;m adding two new domains to my network:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-voice/api-voice-logo.png" alt="" width="130" align="right" /> <strong><a title="API Voice" href="http://apivoice.com"> API Voice</a></strong> - A blog about the politics of APIs.  Issues that face API owners and developers while trying to develop and manage API ecosystems</li>
<li> <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-stack/api-stack-logo.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /><strong><a title="The API Stack" href="http://theapistack.com"> The API Stack</a></strong> - A listing of top APIs, ranked using an algorthm I&rsquo;m evolving, that helps me discover new and identify strong and emerging APIs--as well as APIs that aren&rsquo;t fully delivering</li>
</ul>
<p>As I&rsquo;m finding more time to focus on the space you will find my coverage of the business of APIs on API Evangelist, the politics of APIs on API Voice, and a view into how I rank and monitor APIs at The API Stack.</p>
<p>I hope you find some value in my research in the space.  I know I learn a lot, every day.</p>
