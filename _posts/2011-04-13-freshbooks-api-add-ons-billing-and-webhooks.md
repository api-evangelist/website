{% include JB/setup %}<p>I am slowly working my way through hundreds of APIs and doing business reviews of their approach to delivering their APIs.At API Evangelist Im focused on the business of APIs, with a minor focus on the technology behind those APIs.So when I publish a business review of an API, I will add it to my API database, then move on.That is, unless I identify a story -- an innovative approach, monetization strategy, or anything that I feel needs to be talked about in more detail.While reviewing the Freshbooks API I found three notable building blocks: Application Billing - A built in billing and payment framework for Freshbook applications and beyond Webhooks - Framework for enabling application callbacks, URLs where the Freshbook system can send notifications to third party applications FreshBooks Add-on Store - Application store and development platform for developers to build custom apps, showcase, and sell to Freshbook customers.</p>
