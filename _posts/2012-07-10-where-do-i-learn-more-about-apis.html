<p>
     When it comes to the business side of APIs, <a title="API Evangelist">API Evangelist</a> is where you want to be. I’m also working to build out <a title="API Voice" href="http://apivoice.com/">API Voice</a> as a source of information on the politics of APIs.
</p>
<p>
     But where do you go for the deeper, technical side of APIs? I recommend <a title="API Craft" href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups!forum/api-craft" target="_blank">API Craft</a>.
</p>
<p>
     API Craft is a Google Group setup by API service provider <a title="Apigee" href="http://apigee.com/" target="_blank">Apigee</a> to discuss everything about APIs. API Craft has over 1300 active members, generating conversation about where to meet-up and talk APIs in different cities to the finer points of HATEOAS.
</p>
<p>
     There are some seriously smart folks on the forum, from companies who already lead the space, discussing their API implementations and sharing insights. Apigee and the community has done an amazing job keeping the forum all about APIs and not about selling our warez.
</p>
<p>
     If you are not already a member, and looking to deploy an API, or just want to learn the finer points of API development, and management I recommend checking out <a title="API Craft" href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups!forum/api-craft" target="_blank">API Craft</a>.
