[Dale McCrory, Software and Product Management Leader at Breeze Strategy came back to share his knowledge of API operations through the product manager lens](https://conversations.apievangelist.com/sessions/2024-09-18-dale-mccrory-breeze-strategy.html). I am very interested in having product management leaders by to share their view of API operations, because when it comes to API governance, the alignment with business is going to be the biggest challenge for enterprises. Dale shared his wisdom on how to convince leadership that they need to invest APIs, but also in API product managers.

Dale has more tech chops than most product managers I've encountered across enterprise API operations, and I think his perspective offers areas other product manager should be thinking about when it comes to value generation and providing real-world solutions for the enterprise. Dale had a healthy awareness of the API landscape and that this isn't just about producing 3rd-party APIs, and there are many other 1st-party and internal API needs, but also depending on 3rd-party APIs as part of the enterprise supply chain. Thanks for coming by Dale, it has been a long journey for both of us, and I'm thankful to still be learning from you after all these years.
