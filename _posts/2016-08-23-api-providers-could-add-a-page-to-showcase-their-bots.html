<p>I am coming across more API providers who have carved off specific "skills" derived from their API, and offering up as part of the latest&nbsp;push to acquire new users on Slack or Facebook. Services like Github, Heroku, and Runscope that API providers&nbsp;and developers are putting to work increasingly have bots they employ, extending their API driven solutions to Slack and Facebook.
<p>Alongside having an application gallery, and having an iPaaS solution showcase, maybe it's time to start having a dedicated page to showcase the bot solutions that are built on your API. Of course, these would start with your own bot solutions, but like application galleries, you could have bots that were built within your community as well.
<p>I'm not going to add a dedicated&nbsp;bot showcase page until I've seen at least a handful in the wild, but I like documenting these things as I think of them. It gives me some dates to better understand at which point did certain things in the API universe begin expanding (or not). Also if you are doing a lot of bot development around your API, or maybe your community is, it might be the little nudge you need to be one of the first APIs out there with a dedicated bot showcase page.
