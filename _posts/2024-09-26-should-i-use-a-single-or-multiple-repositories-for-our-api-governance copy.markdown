[Bruno Vaz da Costa, API Architect (digital plumber) at RHI Magnesita came by to share what APIs means to his enterprise operating in the refractory industry](https://conversations.apievangelist.com/sessions/2024-09-26-bruno-vaz-da-costa-api-architect-digital-plumber-at-rhi-magnesita.html), what their biggest challenges are, and thoughts around how they can standardize around APIs. This type of conversation reflects where I want to go with these API conversations, getting out of the API echo chamber and talking with folks doing the good work to standardize and govern APIs in these mainstream industries.

Bruno is exactly the type of architect I enjoy talking to. He knows his stuff about APIs, and he is super passionate about making API change across the company and industry he works in--he just has a huge uphill battle ahead of him convincing his coworkers that APIs matter. He also operates in an industry where very few people know or care about APIs, but I think Bruno's approach to keep talking about APIs in purely business terms is how you make the API change you want to see. Thanks Bruno for coming by and sharing your story with me, and I hope you get to invest more in standards for the Refractory industry.
