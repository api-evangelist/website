</p>
<p>
     The organizers of <a href="http://apidays.io/">APIs Days</a> asked me at the last moment if I'd like to do a third talk at the European API event, due to last minute cancellations.  Of course, I jumped on the opportunity to generate to material and work through it in front of a live audience.  
</p>
<p>
     The talk was on <a href="/admin/blog/Business%20Models%20For%20Your%20API%20as%20a%20Start-Up" target="_blank">business models for your API as a start-up</a>.  On the plane ride over I reviewed <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jmusser/j-musser-apishotnotgluecon2012" target="_blank">John Musser's great material on API business models</a>, and prepared a walk through, from a startup's perspective.  
</p>
<p>
     Then after watching Guillaume Ballas (<a href="https://twitter.com/guillaumebalas">@guillaumebalas</a>) from 3Scale give his talk <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/3scale/apis-for-biz-dev-20-which-business-model-15473323" target="_blank">APIs for Biz Dev 2.0, Which Business Model?</a>  And watching other speakers I decide to scrap what I had put together, and went an entirely different direction.
</p>
<p>
     I decide to walk through the evolution of an imaginary startup, keeping in mind 3Scale's philosphy that:
</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet c2">
     <p>
          Let's not ask what business model for my API.You should be deploying an API for your business model. @<a href="https://twitter.com/3scale">3scale</a> @<a href="https://twitter.com/guillaumebalas">guillaumebalas</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23apidays">apidays</a>
     </p>— Kin Lane (@kinlane) <a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane/status/275622596689661954">December 3, 2012</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
     Then I walked through what I would consider a robust, healthy startup business model with five tiers:
</p>
<p>
     <iframe src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/15473323" width="342" height="291" align="right"></iframe>
</p>
<ul>
     <li>Free users
     </li>
     <li>Paid users
     </li>
     <li>Free developers
     </li>
     <li>Paid developers
     </li>
     <li>Partners
     </li>
     <li>Incubation
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     Of course, this approach isn't for every startup.  I highly recommend checking out 3Scale's presentation if you want to better understand <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/3scale/apis-for-biz-dev-20-which-business-model-15473323">which API business model is right for your startup</a>.
</p>
<p>
     I wanted to tell the story of how you could apply some or all of the monetization strategies outlined by John Musser in his work, while also listening to Guillaume from <a title="3Scale" href="http://www.3scale.net">3Scale</a>.
</p>
<p>
     The talk is rooted in my research on the <a title="Business of Twitter's API" href="http://twitter.apivoice.com/">Business of Twitter's API</a> and experience I've had in the field consulting and building strategies with existing API owners.
</p>
<p>
     You can view the presentation of my <a title="Business Models For Your API as a Start-Up" href="/talks/apidays/business-models/" target="_blank">Business Models For Your API as a Start-Up</a>, and I believe the session was video taped so I'm sure there will be video coming soon.
