     Eduardo Basterrechea (<a href="https://twitter.com/ebaste">@ebaste</a>) of <a href="http://www.apicultur.com/en/" target="_blank">Apicultur</a>, tweeted at me the other day, something I found very interesting, and is a question I will be asking myself on a regular basis:
</p>

               Maybe at the end the APIs providers will only sell bandwidth. The kings will be the designers &amp; front end developers. cc @<a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane">kinlane</a>

     In my mind, bandwidth is just a network resource. APIs are defining the next generation of resources from cloud compute and storage to voice translation or facial recognition.  We will depend on these resources just as we have with bandwidth.
</p>
<p>
     As the "front-end" consumption of these resources evolve from web browser, to mobile and to the Internet of things, all the resources have the potential to be relinquished to something we take for granted--something that is just bought and sold in the background.
</p>

     The attention will always be given to the end deliverable, such as iPhone or iPad, quantified-self device or data visualization. It makes sense that this is where the value is applied.
</p>
<p>
     However, the value does not just lie solely in the end-point, it is equally shared with the open, accessible and extensible pipes that deliver the resources each "front-end" depends on.
</p>
<p>
     This is why I started <a title="API Voice" href="http://apivoice.com">API Voice</a>, to always give the pipes a voice, even if everyone is more excited about the front-end.
