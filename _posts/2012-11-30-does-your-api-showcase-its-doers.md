     Poster boy for how to properly run your API ecosystem properly, <a title="Twilio" href="http://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a>, recently updated their <a href="http://www.twilio.com/doers">DOer Gallery</a> to highlight developers in the Twilio ecosystem that build cool stuff on the popular voice and SMS API.
</p>
<p>
     Twilio has the best record I’ve seen of any API, when it comes to showcasing and being loved by their developer community, and I'm sure the DOer Gallery plays an important role in that.
</p>

</p>
<p>
     The Twilio DOer Gallery has the following features:
</p>
<ul >
     <li>Personal Details
     </li>
     <li>Short Bio
     </li>
     <li>Skills
     </li>
     <li>Other Profiles
     </li>
     <li>Projects
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     Devloper Galleries like Twilios might not be for every API platform. But if you have a passionate base of developers you might want to consider giving them their own profile and a gallery where they can not just discover and interact with each other, it can let other companies find potential developers to execute projects via your API.
</p>
<p>
     A Developer Gallery can be a great way to give your API developers some love and attention. Twilio even features developers from their DOer Gallery on their blog in a "DOer of the Month".

<p>
     Would showcasing your “API DOers” benefit your API community?
