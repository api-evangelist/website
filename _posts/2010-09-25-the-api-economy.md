Application Programming Interfaces (API) are a driving the Internet and our economy. They drive our online experience:

* Developers rely on API for key data and functionality in their applications
* Businesses exchange data and services using API
* Media and press are using them for real-time analysis

API's come in many flavors: [XML-RPC](http://www.apievangelist.com/definition-xml-rpc.php), [SOAP](http://www.apievangelist.com/definition-soap.php), and [REST](http://www.apievangelist.com/definition-rest.php), although [REST](http://www.apievangelist.com/definition-rest.php) is king when it comes to next generation of web applications.

In 2000 businesses were still working to understand the importance of having a web site.

In 2010 businesses are now faced with the growing importance of their API.

If you don't already have an API developed in-house you need to talk with [Mashery](http://www.mashery.com/) or [3Scale](http://www.3scale.net/).

If you have an API, but need to take it to the next level. You need an [API Evangelist](http://www.apievangelist.com).
