They give developers a head start when integrating their applications with an API.
I've explored the concept of <a title="letting your API developer community build code samples and libraries" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/01/use-your-community-to-build-api-code-libraries/">letting your API developer community build code samples and libraries</a>. Doing this may create a more engaged community and give developers a sense of ownership and attachment to the API.
As I <a title="reviewed the Freshbooks API" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/13/freshbooks-api-review/">reviewed the Freshbooks API</a>, I noticed they have a very community-driven API code samples area.
The Freshbooks API provides client libraries in Ruby, Python, PHP, Perl, JavaScript, ActionScript, Java, .NET, and C++, as well as plug-ins for popular frameworks like Zend, Drupal and Symphony.
Many of the <a title="client libraries and plug-ins" href="http://developers.freshbooks.com/sample-code/">client libraries and plug-ins</a> are built by the Freshbooks API community, such as:
<blockquote>
     <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/developers/ryan-szrama.jpg"  width="50" align="right" />Drupal plugin by <a title="Ryan Szrama" href="http://drupal.org/user/49344">Ryan Szrama</a>. Szrama is an active member of the Drupal community.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
     <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/developers/matt-culbreth.jpg"  width="50" align="right" />Python client libraries by <a title="Matt Culbreth" href="http://mattculbreth.com/index.html">Matt Culbreth</a>, a software developer in Marietta, Georgia USA.
</blockquote>By encouraging your API developers to build code samples, plug-ins, and code libraries, you can get necessary tools built for an API. But just as importantly, you're building community and providing a much needed spotlight for your developers. This in turn helps them be successful in their careers.
