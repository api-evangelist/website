Heather Xiao and I go way back talking APIs and open banking standards, but [I invited Heather to sit down and educate me more about Smart Data, and how the intersection of APIs and Smart Data can help us bridge multiple industries like finance, healthcare, and travel](https://conversations.apievangelist.com/sessions/2024-09-24-heather-xiao-horizon-zero-ltd.html). Heather shared insights on how as a community we can speak more in terms of what APIs, data, and standards means to actual end-users, framing the API conversation in terms of the meaningful outcomes for everyday human beings. I will let you listen for yourself.

I have a couple of more episodes already planned with Heather, where we will dive in deeper on a specific use cases for Smart Data. Her approach to API and data standards reflects my approach to doing the work to bridge product and engineering, producers and consumers, but also stay centered on the end-users, and what data access means to them. I think that Heather's experience in Open Banking and finance, and the success she's been part around Open Banking in the UK will translate well to wider cross industry standardization of data and APIs.

Thanks for coming by Heather--looking forward to our next one.
