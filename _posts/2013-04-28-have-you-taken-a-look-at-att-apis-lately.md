{% include JB/setup %}<p>Have you taken a moment and looked at the APIs AT&amp;T is offering through their developer program lately?I think it is an interesting spread of API resources for a leading telco to offer, and is very telling about their strategy.This is one thing I like about my API monitoring platform, is that Im forced to dive deeper into companies that are ubiquitous in the space, and make sure Im kep in tune with where they are actually going.I thought AT&amp;Ts API catalog was interesting in its current state:   Advertising - Create a new revenue stream through the use of customized advertising.The Advertising API allows you to incorporate a simple, easy-to-use solution that supports revednue share-based monetization of your apps through the placement of paid advertising.</p>
