     I spend a lot of time looking for a quick description or logo for companies.  Finding a good quality logo is a pain in the ass!
</p>
<p>
     To be the change I want to see in the world, I created an <a title="about.json" href="/about.json">about.json file for API Evangelist</a>.
</p><script src="https://gist.github.com/4003224.js?file=about.json" type="text/javascript">
</script>
<p>
     Now you can programmatically pull information about API Evangelist, and I will keep updated as things change.
