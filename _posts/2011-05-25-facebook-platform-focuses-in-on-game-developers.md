<a title="Justin Tormey" href="http://twitter.com/!/justintormey">Justin Tormey</a> of Alcatel-Lucent will be talking some about segmentation of API developers to focus on the different types personalities wtihin an API ecosystem.
Focusing outside of Gluecon for a moment, Facebook has been doing a good job of this type of platform segmentation. Yesterday they launched <a title="facebook + Games" href="http://www.facebook.com/fbandgames">Facebook + Games</a>, a page created for the the Facebook games partner and business community. The Facebook Page will focus on social gaming innovation, directly from the Facebook Games Partnerships Team.
I wrote about the the <a title="Journalist on Facebook" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/17/beyond-partners-and-developers-with-your-api/">Journalist on Facebook</a> page last month, and how Facebook is targeting media and journalist with a similar Facebook Partner Platform page. This was another example of their API platform segmentation.
This type of segmentation is key to success within a growing developer ecosystem, not all developers are created equal. Make sure you identify the differences within your community, and provide resources targeted to these gorups.
