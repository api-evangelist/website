Every couple of years I get motivated to take a fresh look at what is happening with APIs across the federal government. Since I worked for the Obama administration I have had a passion for understanding the state of, but also being an advocate for APIs in government. While there are plenty of things that frustrate me when it comes to government APIs, I also find that I am left pretty hopeful about what is happening across each of the federal agencies. Using the digital registry API I pulled a list of federal agencies, produced a cheat sheet for searching Google across a handful of terms, and got to work understanding where things are right now. I rated these agencies on a scale from 1-3, with three being a commitment to APIs evident, and 3 being no APIs are found.

I am making no assessment of each of the APIs, just whether or not the agency has made a commitment to doing APIs, centralizing developer resources, and moving beyond just publishing data. There were 49 agencies I gave a rating of 1 to, with 30 having a rating of 2, and 75 being in the 3 designation. There are some agencies who have no data and aPis, but there are many who have a wealth of data available, but just not seeing the aPI potential. I will write separately about the other thoughts I had throughout this assessment of federal government APIs.
 
I enjoy loading up this knowledge in my head. After doing this I really get a feel for agencies who have valuable data, and those who are investing in APIs. While I was disappointed to see agencies like the Department of Education rollback, I am still very happy to see 49 agencies make it into a rating of 1. I wish every agency had a dedicated developer as well as data portal, with parity between them when it comes to data for downloading, but also quick and easy APIs to use. At some point I am going to have to go back to producing this report in some sort of machine readable way, so that I can track whether or not we are moving forward or going backwards when it comes to government APIs.
