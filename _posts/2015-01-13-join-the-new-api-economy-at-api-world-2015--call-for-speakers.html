<p dir="ltr"><span>The API Revolution is as pivotal a paradigm shift as personal computers, big data technology, and mobile devices. That is because the growth of API&rsquo;s enables technologies to integrate into new solutions leveraging an economy of data, infrastructure, communications, and human interaction. Technology products are now pieces of larger integration networks.</span></p>
