<p>David Berlind&rsquo;s (<a href="https://twitter.com/dberlind">@dberlind</a>), <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/news/amid-api-copyright-controversy-api-patent-claim-surfaces/analysis/2015/01/23">Amid The API Copyright Controversy, An API Patent Claim Surfaces</a> story from this last Friday, planted some ideas in my head around APIs and patents&mdash;something that once takes hold, becomes hopeless for me to resist, and 48 hours later, here are my initial thoughts. First off, patents and APIs, much like copryight and APIs, are not concepts I subscribe to, but because they are concepts that are obviously being wielded in the API space, once again I am forced to participate in the conversation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll let you read David&rsquo;s piece on Pokitdok&rsquo;s claim regarding their &ldquo;patent-pending API&rdquo;, something I find very troubling. This particular story is about my journey, after I read his story, resulting in yet another&nbsp;<a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com/">research project into the politics of patents involving APIs</a>. After reading David's story this Saturday AM (yeah I need a life), I started &ldquo;googling&rdquo; the concept of API patents, just to educate myself&mdash;the eternal mission of API Evangelist.</p>
<p>I was very surprised to find the number of results that come up when you search <a href="https://www.google.com/?tbm=pts&amp;gws_rd=ssl#tbm=pts&amp;q=application+programming+interface">Google Patents for the term &ldquo;application programming interface&rdquo;</a>&mdash;about 552,000 results (0.32 seconds), to be precise. What does this mean? I start reading, and 48 hours later I&rsquo;m still reading. Sure there a number of older patents for hardware APIs, and even many established during the web service era of the late 90&rsquo;s and early 200&rsquo;s, but there is much more than that. I was surprised to see the number of patents with APIs as the main focus from API sector leaders like AWS, Twilio, Apigee, and Google.</p>
<p>I have to start with two of the most ironic API patents i have found so far, during my search:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Google</strong> (<a href="http://www.seobythesea.com/2012/04/google-acquires-unisys-patents/">Through Unisys Patent Portfolio Acquisition</a>) - <strong><a href="https://www.google.com/patents/US7437740?dq=Generation+of+Java+language+application+programming+interface+for+an+object-oriented+data+store&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5qDFVKq2BIaGyQTRyIC4Ag&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA">Generation of Java language application programming interface for an object-oriented data store</a></strong> - An embodiment of the present invention is a technique to interface to a repository. A connection between a client and a repository database is established. The repository database has a repository application programming interface (API). The repository database contains objects related to a project management process. The repository API is communicated with to perform an operation based on parameters passed from the client via the connection. A return value associated with the operation is returned to the client.</li>
<li><strong>CopyRightNow</strong> - <strong><a href="https://www.google.com/patents/US20140214700?dq=Disclosed+herein+is+a+method+and+system+for+providing+copyright+protection+for+creative+works+from+within+a+running+content-creating+software+application&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IqHFVOqDDIOxyQSorIKwAw&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA">CopyRightNow Application Programming Interface</a></strong> - Disclosed herein is a method and system for providing copyright protection for creative works from within a running content-creating software application by assembling and submitting a copyright application on the creative work to the United States Copyright Office through the use of a portable application programming interface, which may be utilized by third-party content-creating applications.

Additionally disclosed is a method and system for accessing and sharing copyright-protected creative works through a web accessible software application.</li>
</ul>
<p>I spent most of the day Saturday looking through API patents, trying to separate the hardware from software, and the API adjacent to the specific API patents. I began my journey at Google Patent Search, and eventually find myself using Google Patent Search API (now deprecated), untnil I hit the wall there, I end up at the data source, processing XML files. I&rsquo;m only now getting to 2013, after 24 hours or making sense of, writing a processing script, and downloading of patent XML files&mdash;so far I have XX patents where &ldquo;application programming interface&rdquo; shows up in the title, abstract, description, or anywhere else in the content of a patent application.</p>
