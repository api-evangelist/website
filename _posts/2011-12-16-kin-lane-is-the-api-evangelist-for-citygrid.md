     Here we are, wrapping up 2011. I concluded my first full year immersed in the <a title="business of apis" href="/business_of_apis.php">business of APIs</a>, which started back in September 2010 with my <a title="first blog post on API Evangelist" href="/2010/09/25/hello-world/">first blog post on API Evangelist</a>, then by December I was the <a title="API Evangelist for Mimeo" href="http://developer.mimeo.com">API Evangelist for Mimeo</a>.
</p>
<p>
     In 2011, I spent the entire year evangelizing for <a title="Mimeo" href="http://www.mimeo.com">Mimeo</a>, while also paying attention to the wider business of APIs, while writing for <a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://www.programmableweb.com/profile/kinlane">ProgrammableWeb</a> and <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>. It’s been an amazing year and I’ve learned a lot, but it has left me wanting even more in 2012.
</p>
<p>
     I’m convinced that focusing my evangelism on a single API is important, it helps put into practice, what I write about as an analyst in the API space. In 2011, I was exposed to a lot, but in 2012 I need a more high profile, active API to evangelize if I'm going to achieve what I want.
</p>
<p>
     So, to set the stage for 2012, this month I’ve been making the transition from being the API Evangelist for Mimeo to the API Evangelist for <a title="CityGrid" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com/">CityGrid</a>. As I see it, CityGrid has a lot more opportunity around their two very distinct APIs:
</p>
<ul >
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Local Places API" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Content+by+CityGrid">Local Places APIs</a></strong> - Information about business listings including location, website, business hours, offers, reviews, maps, images and other rich content.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong><a title="Local Advertising APIs" href="http://docs.citygridmedia.com/display/citygridv2/Ads+by+CityGrid">Local Advertising APIs</a></strong> - Mobile and web app advertising network that allows developers get paid for displaying local content.
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     Hyperlocal and mobile are both fast growing areas in our society, and I see a huge opportunity to make an impact with a high value API like CityGrid in this space. After reviewing CityGrid, I saw several of the key characteristics I look for in an API: clear value, ease of use and a clear revenue model for both the company and the developer.
</p>
<p>
     Based upon success I’ve seen around Hackathons in 2011, I’ve been trying to figure out how to step up my involvement in the hackathon space in 2012. As the API Evangelist for CityGrid I have an opportunity to step up my sponsorship and participation in hackathons across the United States. So, in 2012, I’ll be taking CityGrid APIs on the road and seeing what developers and I can do with them in cities across the country.
</p>
<p>
     After meeting everyone behind CityGrid and seeing the un-tapped potential of their APIs I couldn't say no when they asked me to be their API Evangelist. I’m extremely excited to be working with <a title="CityGrid" href="http://www.citygrid.com">CityGrid</a>--I see a lot of potential. Stay tuned for 2012, its going to be another great year for APIs.
