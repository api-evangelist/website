     We all have our own approaches to API design and development, many of which will never see the light of day. In the API space we hear a lot about API management and API success stories, but not much about the process of designing, developing and initial deployment of APIs. I just had a little taste of how the <a href="http://www.wordnik.com/" target="_blank">Wordnik</a> team approaches it, using <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/05/the-swagger-spec-is-reborn-as-open-api-definition-format-oadf-after-being-put-into-open-api-initiative-oai/" target="_blank">Swagger</a>.

     Often when you hear about Swagger in the industry, you hear about the UI portion. You know the sexy <a title="interactive documentation" href="http://apievangelist.com/buildingblocks/interactive_documentation.php">interactive documentation</a> that is fast becoming a standard with APIs, but it’s just the tip of the iceberg--there is a whole lot more power to Swagger, than just interactive docs.

     <em>“The heart of Swagger is the specification, and from that, cool shit can get done!”, say Tony Tam Wordnik CEO and technical co-founder.</em>
</p>
<p>
     To demonstrate, Tony walked me through Wordnik’s approach to designing, developming and deploying a new API driven iPad app, using a team of 3:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>One person driving an editor writing JSON files, which are the Swagger spec for the needed API
     </li>
     <li>The all three discussed the operations, parameters, while adding them to the JSON, and re-running the swagger spec validator after each meaningful change
     </li>
     <li>When they were happy with the specs, they loaded the JSON files into the UI through apache installed on a local machine
     </li>
     <li>After they inspected each API and operation again, they wrote the models in the spec files, and reviewed again to make sure everything was good
     </li>
     <li>Then they ran the Swagger Codegen and generated a Scalatra (Scala) server from the spec files
     </li>
     <li>Then they ran the Swagger Codegen and generated an Objective-C client from the spec files
     </li>
     <li>The server developer went off and wired the server to the business logic
     </li>
     <li>The front-end guy went and wired the UI to the objective-c library
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     The process took 2.5 hours in total, from API to interface--a technique they call interface-driven development, which focuses on modeling the perfect interface for the problem they are trying to solve using an API.

     To solve this particular problem, they needed a scala server for the back-end. they could have just as easily generated a Node.JS server, a Rails Sinatra server or any other based upon simple <a title="mustache templates" href="http://mustache.github.com/">mustache templates</a>. Additionally they could generate JavaScript, Scala, PHP or Python clients, but for this project they only needed Objective-C.

     The <a href="http://www.wordnik.com/" target="_blank">Wordnik</a> approach to API design and development using <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/05/the-swagger-spec-is-reborn-as-open-api-definition-format-oadf-after-being-put-into-open-api-initiative-oai/" target="_blank">Swagger</a> is interesting. For me, it demonstrates that a clean API spec should not be an afterthought, and a means by which you generate interactive API documentation, or when API discovery becomes an issue. Your entire design, development and management process should center around a meaningful API spec, which will then allow you to deploy your API server, interactive documentation, client code, while also providing API discovery.
