<p>I am going through all my notes from organizing the <a title="CityGrid Los angeles Hackathon" href="http://www.citygridmedia.com/developer/blog/citygrid-hackathon-los-angeles-is-a-wrap/">CityGrid Los Angeles Hackathon</a> and trying to publish as many stories as I can, about how I planned and organized the hackathon.
<p>One service that was a catalyst for the event occuring, was assistance from <a title="EventUp" href="http://eventup.com/">EventUp</a>.  EventUp is a service that assists event venue owners in finding people to rent their space, and in turn can help you find the ideal location for your hackathon.&nbsp;
<p>Tony Adam (<a title="@tonyadam" href="https://twitter.com/#!/tonyadam">@tonyadam</a>) the owner of EventUp emailed me one day after I had submitted a request via eventup.com for more information on venues for my Hackathon in the Los Angeles area.  He offered to help make sure I found the right location.
<p>After a couple days he helped me secure <a href="http://www.coloft.com/">CoLoft</a> which was the best location for the hackathon imaginable.  It was accessible, had great layout with tables, good wifi and the staff was extremely helpful.
<p><a title="EventUp" href="http://eventup.com/">EventUp</a> isn&rsquo;t in all markets yet, but if you&rsquo;re planning a hackathon I recommend talking with Tony at Eventup, and seeing if they have the right location for your event.
