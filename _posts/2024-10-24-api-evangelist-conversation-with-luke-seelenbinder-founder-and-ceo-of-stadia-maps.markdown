I recently sat down for a conversation with [Luke Seelenbinder, Founder & CEO of Stadia Maps](https://conversations.apievangelist.com/sessions/2024-10-24-luke-seelenbinder-stadia-maps.html) to talk about taking on Google Maps with a more sensible and affordable mapping solution. As I learned more about the Stadia Maps journey I found ourselves talking about product-led motions for companies, and what the meaning of APIs as a product was. Luke and Stadia maps reflects the real world businesses who are doing APIs that I am looking to talk with, because they aren't playing in the startup hustle, and actually are building a real-world business that is in tune with and responds to actual market forces.

Talking with people doing real API businesses, and not just the startup hustle matters to me. This is what I am doing with API Evangelist, and this is what I believe provides the real-world nutrients that markets need. I am not against venture capital when necessary, but businesses like Stadia Maps have a healthier alignment with markets, and aren't just about disrupting them. I enjoy talking about product-led motions with companies like Stadia Maps and how they see APIs as a product. Their challenges with investing in their sales capacity become much more human and real at this scale, and is something that keeps me interested.

I'd like to revisit the conversation and explore why they chose to build their own CDN -- I think that decision as a competitive edge is really interesting. I appreciate you stopping by Luke, and looking forward to more conversations.
