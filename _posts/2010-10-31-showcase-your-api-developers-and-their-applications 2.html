<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/world-bank-data-api.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" />Do you have a cool application built on top of your API?  (Hopefully you do!)<p></p>
I'm sure there are some amazing developers who have worked hard on developing applications that make use of your API.  They have seen the value your API delivers and built an application that extends that value to their users.<p></p>
An application showcase could be an important building block of your API community.   An application showcase can provide an great way to reward your developers with exposure.  It also will make them feel like an important part of your community.   This is a great way to encourage their participation in other areas of your API ecosystem.<p></p>
An application showcase also can inspire new developers looking for ideas of how they can use your API.  Developers might not understand how to put your API to use, and seeing how other community members have used the API may help.  You never know -- your community may even show you some ways of using your API that you never have thought of.<p></p>
You can see application showcases being use by successful APIs such as <a href="http://www.zemanta.com/blog/category/api-showcase/">Zemanta</a>, <a href="https://www.x.com/community/ppx/showcase">Paypal</a>, <a href="http://google-code-featured.blogspot.com/search/label/base">Google, and even the </a><a href="http://data.worldbank.org/developers/application-showcase">World Bank</a>.<p></p>
Consider an application showcase for your API developer community.
