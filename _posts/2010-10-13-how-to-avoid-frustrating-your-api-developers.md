Because even if you are a giant like Facebook, you really cannot afford to have your API be an excruciating experience (although, yes, Facebook can probably afford it more than others).
Seth Call recently wrote a blog post called <a href="http://www.sethcall.com/blog/2010/09/30/facebook-api-does-not-care/">The Facebook API: A Case Study in Not Caring About Developers</a><a>. And while the post is directed at Facebook, Call's observations about how to (mis)treat your developer community offer important insights that any company should pay attention to.</a>
<a>The post lays out several reasons why working with the Facebook API is, in his words, "one of the worst experiences as a developer I have ever had."</a>
<ol >
     <li>
          <a>Poor Documentation</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a>Poor Testability</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a>No Response to Serious Issues</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a>Constantly Changing API</a>
     </li>
</ol><a>Call's post is interesting as it chronicles (in great detail) how he has had to struggle (unnecessarily) at almost every stage of working with the Facebook API -- a struggle that could easily be addressed with better documentation and better customer service.</a>
<a>And the latter is an important reminder that while you might not view third-party developers as such, they are your customers.</a>
