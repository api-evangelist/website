I connected with Jamie Tanna on [the API's You Won't Hate Slack channel](https://apisyouwonthate.com/), where I started subscribing to his blog. After reading a post on versioning, and more specifically why you should start the version for your API at 0.1.0 instead of 1.0.0, I knew I needed to have him come for a conversation. [I really enjoyed Jamie's calm and pragmatic approach to what web APIs are, what Semantic Versioning is](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ie6eMzCUI34/hqdefault.jpg), and how versioning and change management can really help us enable both API producers and consumers to stay aligned.

I am really enjoying the API versioning conversations. I had one with [Stanislav Zmiev, Tech Lead of Platform Engineering at Monite about their versioning framework](https://apievangelist.com/2024/09/04/api-evangelist-conversation-with-stanislav-zmiev-tech-lead-of-platform-engineering-at-monite/), and now this one with Jamie Tanna about where to start with versioning. I have some conversations started with folks who are in the no versioning camp with APIs, which I think will round off this conversation. These are exactly the types of conversations I am looking to have when it comes to shaping the policies I am developing to help govern the API lifecycle.
