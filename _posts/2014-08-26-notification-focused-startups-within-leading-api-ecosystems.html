<p>I was keeping an eye out for interesting API stories on <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/">ProductHunt</a> the other day and came across an cool notification startup that lives in the Stripe API ecosystem, called <a href="https://hooked.io/">Hooked</a>.
<p>Hooked allows users to set up notifications for any events related to a Stripe account. Hooked uses the Stripe API to disocver events, and then employs webhooks to send notifications.
<p>As I'm writing this story, I realize this is very similar to my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/26/realtime-and-visualizations-will-be-key-in-financial-api-deployments/">previous story today about real-time and visualization layers for APIs</a>, and that notifications could easily be provided as a white label solution for API providers, giving them a ready to go notification layer to their APIs.
<p>Right now I lump notifications in my research under <a href="http://realtime.apievangelist.com/">real-time</a>, but I think I will be pulling it out into its own research area. Notifications are real-time, but they are more messaging than just a real-time feature, but they are kind of more real-time than just a message too. Does that make sense?
<p>We'll see. That is the fun of my API Evangelist research network, is that all of it is pretty liquid&mdash;allowing me to keep moving things around until they make sense in my head.
