<p>It is hard for me to track on everything&nbsp;in the API space as a one man show, but one thing I keep an eye on, but rarely add to my research (yet) are the increasing number of job postings I come across that have an API focus. An interesting one this week, which follows a new vein in the API space that I'm mining, is out of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.battelle.org/careers">the applied science technology research organization Battelle</a>.
<p>They have an interesting <a href="http://jobs.militarytimes.com/jobs/Cyber-Computer-Scientist-II/J3J2PL717Z5R8TS0JMJ">job posting for a cyber computer scientist</a> with Battelle&rsquo;s Cyber Innovation Unit (CIU) providing "a broad range of products and services including Cyber Intelligence and Counter Intelligence, Cyber Research and Development and Fundamental Science, On&shy;site Advisory Services, and Mission Focused tools including Embedded Systems Reverse Engineering."&nbsp;
<p>What brought the job posting up on my radar is one of the responsibilities being for "data APIs", and a requirement (mentioned twice) for having API design skills. The role APIs are playing in the areas of cyber security, cyber intelligence, and apparently "cyber innovation" is why <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/30/why-i-added-cybersecurity-to-my-api-monitoring-research/">I recently added cybersecurity as a research area to my API monitoring stack</a>. It's not that&nbsp;APIs are being hacked, it is that they are being used for research, analysis, collaboration, communication, and other layers of the <a href="http://cybersecurity.theater">cybersecurity theater</a>.
<p><span>If I keep coming across interesting job postings like this I may have to start tracking on API jobs more, as the overall volume of API jobs that are coming across my radar is increasing, but also the interestingness&nbsp;is also trending upward significantly.&nbsp;</span>
