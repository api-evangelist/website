I was happy to have Raymond Camden, Developer Advocate at Adobe come by for another conversation. Raymond was on Breaking Changes back in the day, and I've been a follower of his work for well over a decade. He provided his obligatory plug for Adobe APIs he is an advocate for, but what is really motivating him was his new work at the intersection of API and AI. I don't have the time and budget to go to deep on AI, so I enjoy learning from someone who is as curious and pragmatic as I am about new technologies, a conversation that left me with some ideas of how I am going to use not just ChatGPT, but also Google Gemini for some of the API profiling work I am doing.

I have already started evolving the vocabulary and semantics of how I am asking AI to do work for me when profiling public APIs based upon my conversation with Raymond. I am also beginning to do more work with Google Gemini when it comes to my AI experiments based upon Raymond explaining how he uses the AI and API. He also got me thinking more about Cloudflare workers. I am loyal Cloudflare customer when it comes to DNS, but have been meaning to adopt more of their services in my work--it might be a good opportunity to revisit. 

My conversation with Raymond always gets my hacker storytelling mojo going. As I've said before, Raymond's blogging was a major inspiration in me starting API Evangelist. I am super thankful for his work and boundless energy and curiosity behind his storytelling. It might just me the jump start I need to play around with AI more as part of my daily work. Thanks for stopping by Raymond!!
