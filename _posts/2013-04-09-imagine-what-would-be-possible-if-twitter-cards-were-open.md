     Last week Twitter expanded its Twitter Cards initiative to <a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/04/02/looking-to-find-new-apps-twitter-adds-third-party-app-discovery-and-deep-links/">allow 3rd party app developers to include links to download apps within Tweets</a>, opening up new opportunities for app discovery via Twitter. Yay, for app developers...
</p>
<p>
     I won’t try to explain the <a title="history of Twitters approach to their ecosystem" href="http://twitter.apivoice.com/">history of Twitter's approach to their ecosystem</a>, their <a title="Twitters tight fisted approach to cards" href="http://apivoice.com/2012/06/13/twitter-launches-new-not-so-open-graph-aka-twitter-cards/">tight fisted approach to Twitter Cards</a>, and how it affects this latest app discovery announcement. Matthew Ingram does an amazing job (as always) of capturing the essence with <a title="Twitter plays its platform hand, and it is the one holding all the Cards" href="http://gigaom.com/2013/04/03/twitter-plays-its-platform-hand-and-it-is-the-one-holding-all-the-cards/">Twitter plays its platform hand, and it is the one holding all the Cards</a>.
</p>
<p>
     My point is, their announcement isn’t that exciting. Could you imagine what would be possible if Twitter decide to actually use an open standard like <a title="Open Graph" href="http://ogp.me/">Open Graph</a>, and allowed developers to innovate within Tweets using Twitter Cards?
</p>
<p>
     I fully understand Twitter wants control over their platform, and I don’t deny any platform the right to assert control. And yes, Twitter allows their <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/programs/twitter-certified-products">approved partners</a> to play in this arena. But that isn’t open!  And, it isn’t part of the OG vision that Twitter was built on.
</p>
<p>
     In my opinion, Twitter is missing out on soooo much opportunity for innovation in the space that exists within a Tweet. Sure, not every developer idea would be good or even viable, but without opening it up, we will never know what is possible, and what end-users would want and embrace.  It is all up to Twitter. 
</p>
<p>
     So much missed opportunity for innovation, in the name of control. :-(

     <strong>Correction:</strong> I call Open Graph a Standard.  I should have said protocol.  I will leave as is, and just admit my error.
