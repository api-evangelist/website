<p>While I was in Paris speaking at <a title="API Days" href="http://apidays.io" target="_blank">API Days </a>last week, a drawing of me was circulated on Twitter. &nbsp;I was a little speachless when I saw them on Twitter. &nbsp;I am always looking for new graphics to use in API Evangelist. &nbsp;I worked for hours to come up with the logo I have, so I was stoked to see someone create something so cool, in the moment.
