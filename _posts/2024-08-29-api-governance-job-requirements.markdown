One way I keep my finger on the pulse of API governance is studying the job postings out there in any given moment. I learn a lot from what companies are asking for via their job posts, while also understanding which companies and industries are finding themselves at the point in their API journey where API governance is needed. 

I am unpacking give API governance job posts for [First Citizen Bank](https://www.jobzmall.com/first-citizens-bank/job/developer-api-governance), [Wells Fargo](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/api-standards-and-governance-analyst-at-wells-fargo-3990419685/), [VLink[(https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/api-governance-at-vlink-inc-3987566021/), [Humana](https://careers.humana.com/job/20932874/associate-director-enterprise-api-standards-governance-us-nationwide/), and [Bloomberg](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/team-lead-api-governance-at-bloomberg-4008384731/). That represents 2 Banks, an IT Management, Financial, and Healthcare company so far. Interesting. Lots to learn across these postings beyond just the usage of AI to write your job descriptions. 

Honestly I struggle with the separation of skills, responsibilities, and requirements across these posts. There is a lot of streams being crossed and redundancy of concepts, just using slightly different words. The obsession for standardization (not listed) in me is pushing me towards crafting a standardize API governance job description from what I am seeing--something that will take me time to do properly, but to prime the pump, here is what companies are looking for when it comes to API governance at the enterprise level.

First, that is a lot of shit y'all are asking for. Granted, this list comes from across all five job postings, but I felt like the list is pretty long while reading each one of them. There is a lot of define, implement, execute, measure, enforce, educate across almost every stage of the API lifecycle. There is a lot of expectation that governance is responsible for the change, and not adequate verbage about what compliance, security, product, marketing, communications, sales, and leadership teams are bringing to the table--it is more about setting polices and performing broadcast governance. 

Sadly, this list represents the current state of where governance is needed--everywhere. This isn't API governance, this is enterprise governance. With the role that APIs play in all parts of the enterprise, internally and externally these days, the technology, business, policies, and people of all of this listed above is enterprise governance. I am going to weigh this list against my current definition of API governance and I am preparing a template API governance job posting that I will submit to the [API Commons](http://apicommons.org) for anyone to use--providing an openly licensed API governance job posting that accurately represents the current state of APIs, but also meets enterprise where they are today.
