     <a title="OpenKit" href="http://openkit.io/">A new player in the</a> <a title="Backend as a Service" href="/trends/baas.php">Backend as a Service (BaaS)</a> space has emerged, from former <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenFeint">OpenFeint</a> co-founder Peter Relan--called <a title="OpenKit" href="http://openkit.io/">OpenKit</a>.  The new BaaS platform is targeting game developers, providing cross-platform tools for both iOS and Android.  The core features of the gaming BaaS platform are:
</p>
<ul>
     <li>
          <strong>Cloud data sync</strong> - Save game progress in the cloud with data storage. Sync it across both iOS and Android devices for a consistent gaming experience
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Leaderboards</strong> - Drop-in leaderboard SDK's for both iOS and Android. Give your users the opportunity to compete against millions of other players
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Facebook &amp; Twitter auth</strong> - Users login with familiar third party social networks like Facebook and Twitter. No need to create and manage accounts. OpenKit handles it all
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Cross-platform support</strong> - OpenKit supports both iOS and Android. Our native SDKs are lightweight and will take just a few minutes to integrate into your game
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     OpenKit represents a trend I’m tracking on where people are pulling together specialized or <a title="virtualized stacks" href="/2013/01/28/virtualized-api-stacks/">virtualized stacks</a> targeting specific groups of developers. Early movers in the space like Kinvey, Parse and Cloudmine have generally catered to all types of developers by providing them a backend stack, that assists them in rapidly building mobile and web apps. So naturally the next step is to see more specialized stacks, for smaller groups of developers.
</p>
<p>
     I’m stoked to see that OpenKit is completely <a href="https://github.com/openkit">open source, readily available on Github</a>, as well as comes out of the box with a REST API. <a title="open source baas" href="/2012/08/28/open-source-mobile-backend-as-a-service/">Open source BaaS is something I was identifying was missing from the space</a>.
</p>
<p>
     I will add OpenKit to my <a title="baas trends" href="/trends/baas.php">trends section for Backend as a Service</a>, where I’m tracking on the BaaS space, and will dive in deeper and compare it with some of the other offerings we are seeing emerge.
