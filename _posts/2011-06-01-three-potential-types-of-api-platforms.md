The best part of events like Gluecon is you get to hang with some really smart and extremely experienced people.
I'm working to understand a new perspective I was exposed to while listening to Mark Suster talk about the Cloud Computing: Challenges and Opportunities over the Next Five Years.
In his talk, he outlined three potential types of platforms:
<ul >
     <li>
          <strong>Platform as a Service</strong> - Platform around core application or business as an API, allowing others to build businesses on top of, and make money.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Platform as an Extension</strong> - Platform around a core application that offers APIs as an extension for others to build on bringing value back to the core business.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Platform as a Trojan Horse</strong> - Platform that allows others to build on, taking the risk, and the core business benefits from any value created.
     </li>
</ul>As I work my way through the hundreds of available APIS I will definitely be applying what I'm learning...
What is the motivation of each of these API platforms?
