{% include JB/setup %}<p>I spend a lot of time on API Evangelist getting excited about APIs.Going on three years doing this, Im getting a little more hardened in my view on what is good in the API space.Along with that evolution, Im getting my priorities in order.While I may get excited about cloud computing APIs or quantified self APIs, there are other areas I think are straight up priorities--ones that we cant ignore.To support this Im launching several research projects into areas I have labeled as API priorities: Federal Government City Government Education Healthcare Libraries Universities These represent areas Im actively doing research in, looking for the best APIs, tools, services, building blocks and news while also generating as much analysis and white papers as I can to help define what is going on.</p>
