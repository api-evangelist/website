     For the last couple weeks I’m neck deep in getting to know the developers who already use the <a title="CityGrid Developers" href="http://developer.citygridmedia.com/">CityGrid APIs</a>. I want a better understanding of who a developer is, what kind of business they have and what they are looking to get out of the API.
</p>
<p>
     To find this out I start out profiling them socially using <a title="Rapportive" href="http://rapportive.com/">Rapportive</a> (which I plan on automating using the <a title="Full Contact API" href="http://www.fullcontact.com/">Full Contact API</a> as soon as I have more time) for the following information:
</p>
<ul >
     <li>Twitter Profile
     </li>
     <li>LinkedIn Account
     </li>
     <li>Facebook Profile
     </li>
     <li>Google + Profile
     </li>
     <li>Github Profile
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     Usually I know the URL of their website, but if I don’t, I can extract from their email address or sometimes Rapportive will provide for me. I visit each developer’s site and look for:
</p>
<ul >
     <li>Blog w/ RSS Feed
     </li>
     <li>Business Contact Email
     </li>
     <li>Business Contact Form
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     Next I build a quick one sentence description, telling me who they are and what they do. I also assemble a comma separated list of keyword and key phrases that best represent what they do.
</p>
<p>
     Before I’m done looking around their site I take a picture of their home page, so I have a visual reference to go with the developer profile. The home page image can go further than just a logo sometimes.

</p>
<p>
     I take all of this information, put it into a database, and connected it to a JQuery Carousel that allows me to watch a slideshow that walks me through the world of my developers, and watch like a TV channel.
</p>
<p>
     This process not only gives me a 100K understanding my developer ecosystem, but helps me remember as much as I can about each developer. From this I hope to better engage them on a daily basis as well as provide feedback to the CityGrid API roadmap based upon quality API developer segmentation.
