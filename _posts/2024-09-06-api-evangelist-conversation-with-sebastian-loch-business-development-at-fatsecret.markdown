I was joined by [Sebastian Loch](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sloch/), Business Development at [FatSecret](https://www.fatsecret.com/) for a conversation about how they have managed their nutrition data API since 2007. I connected with Sebastian as part of my profiling their API for APis.io, and after we talked a bit, he caught my attention by mentioning how much work goes into not just operating a highly curated global database of nutrition data when every AI out there wants to gobble it up, but also how much work has gone into developing their artificial intelligence over the years. I will let you listen to our conversation, and hear Sebastian’s story for yourself.

[Conversation with API producers like Sebastian are exactly the types of conversation I am trying to land with this series](https://conversations.apievangelist.com/sessions/2024-09-05-sebastian-loch-fatsecret.html). He is a business stakeholder who manages a simple yet powerful API that makes high quality data available globally in many different web, mobile, and now artificial intelligence applications. I commend Sebastian’s tech chops and appreciate him sharing how other business stakeholders can learn what they need to know about APIs. I am also thankful for Sebastian sharing his story about the business development side of API usage in artificial intelligence, as well as adding a 3rd dimension of AI + API relationship—-adding AI to your own stack, as well as feeding AI with your API, and providing AI via API. 

I suspect I will have Sebastian back to talk about this intersection of the technology and business of APIs, but also the intersection of AI and API.
