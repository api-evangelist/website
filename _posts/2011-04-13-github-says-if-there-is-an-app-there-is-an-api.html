<img src="https://kinlane-productions2.s3.amazonaws.com/github/github-jobs.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" />Github launched some<a title="enhancements to its Github Jobs homepage" href="https://github.com/blog/836-github-jobs-update">enhancements to its GitHub Jobs homepage</a>, and IPhone application.<p>
Being the forward thinkers they are, they say:
<blockquote><em>If there's an app there's an API, so we've made ours available to everyone...</em></blockquote>
The <a title="GitHub Jobs API" href="https://jobs.github.com/api">GitHub Jobs API</a> allows you to search, view, and create jobs with JSON over HTTP.<p>
The APIalso provides support for JSONP, by appending ?callback=myFunction to any API request, it will wrap the response in a function call to myFunction. This is useful when making requests to the GitHub Jobs API using JavaScript.<p>
Nothing to revolutionary, or noteworthy about the API, except Github is just way cool, and I love their perspective that, if there is an app there is an API.
