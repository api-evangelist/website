<p>I am finally seeing more solutions available for API providers when it comes to publishing an portal for their API operations. <a href="http://portal.minimum.apievangelist.com/">I've long had my minimum viable API portal definition</a>, which I recently <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/03/02/my-developer-portal-checklist-for-a-human-services-api/">deployed to support the Miami Open211 API</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/02/28/the-aws-serverless-api-portal/">I also wrote about AWS serverless approach to an API portal</a>. Next up, is <a href="https://tyk.io/2017/03/01/new-wordpress-api-portal-plugin/">a WordPress solution from my API management partner Tyk</a>.
<p>The WordPress API portal solution has the following features:
<ul>
<li>Automatic developer registration on Tyk when developers sign up in WP</li>
<li>Configuration of API policies available for token registration</li>
<li>Developers may request an access token for the available API policies</li>
<li>Automatic or manual approval of key requests</li>
<li>Storage of token (references) by name and API policy</li>
<li>Revoking of tokens by developer</li>
<li>Display usage statistics per key</li>
<li>Request quota usage per key</li>
</ul>
<p>All the basics you need when standing up a basic API operation. If WordPress is your go-to content management system, then it might make sense for you to think about API portal&nbsp;in these terms. The<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://opentransportdata.swiss/en/">Swiss Federal Railways (SBB-CFF-FFS)</a>&nbsp;is already using the plugin&nbsp;in production, and you can <a href="https://github.com/liip/wp-tyk-dev-portal">download the plugin on Github</a>, or find it <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/tyk-developer-portal/">over at WordPress.org</a>.
<p>We need multiple versions of API portals like this, designed for every type of platform a company, organization, institution, and government agency might be already using as a default platform for their operations. This is why API management providers <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/02/27/the-api-definition-for-the-tyk-api-gateway/">need to follow Tyk's&nbsp;lead and make sure your solution is API driven</a>--practicing what you preach so that your API management solution can be integrated anywhere.
<ul>
</ul>
