{% include JB/setup %}<p>After reading Adams post from last week, Redesigning the Netflix API: No Versions, Many Endpoints, and lookingthrough the slides from Daniel Jacobsons Netflix talk at OSCON again, I started thinking more about the future of REST, and more specifically when it comes to delivering APIs that support a wide variety of devices.There are a lot of things to consider when it comes each device, such as aspect ratios, touch screens, remote controls, game controllers, voice commands, memory and just a wide range of user expectations in the context of the device.In addition to restriction imposed by the hardware, the network constraints will also vary, with some devices on broadband, others on wifi connections, and a whole new breed of 4G devices.Jacobsens conclusion: Most REST APIs are designed to generically accommodate the needs of a large number of clients�but they are optimized for none.Netflix is pushing into uncharted territory with their use of cloud computing and APIs.</p>
