Subramanian Krishnan, or simply "Subu", Architect and API Integration at Cloud Software Group within Citrix joined came by for an API Evangelist Conversation. Subu was one of the accumulated driving forces that pushed me towards a focus on API governance after our Breaking Changes episode in 2022. So I was happy to have him back to learn more about their API journey. Subu is always pragmatic, seeing the technology, business, and people of APIs equally, which I find to be a rare skill in the world of APIs. So, I enjoyed learning about Subu's push into financial optimization and focus on what Citrix's customers are needing--which is a shift I am seeing beyond just Citrix, and something that is unfolding across many enterprises as they look to do more with fewer resources.

I enjoy checking in on Subu's career journey from time to time. We met way back in the day at API Strategy & Practice, and I like the way he sees the people of APIs. He leads with his heart and mind combined which is rare in this space. Which means he tends to see the good and bad of technology, but he also approaches everything from a very honest standpoint--something even rarer in this realm. I am going to dive deeper into our feedback loops with our consumers and I'll have Subu back cause I know he'll share the realities of ensuring our APIs actually speak to what our consumers need. Subu knows the tech of APIs, but he has a strong grasp on how the business and people of APIs are what is often driving, or should be driving our operations.
