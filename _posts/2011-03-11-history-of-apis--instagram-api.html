<p></p>Less than three months later, it had one million users.
<p></p>Kevin Systrom the founder of <a title="Instagram" href="http://instagr.am/">Instagram</a> focused on delivering a powerful, but simple iPhone app that solved common problems with the quality of mobile photos and users' frustrations with sharing.
<p></p>Immediately many users complained about the lack of central Instagram web site or an API, with Instragram remaining firm on focusing its energy on the core iPhone application.
<p></p>In December a developer name Mislav Marohni? took it upon himself to reverse engineer how the iPhone app worked, and built his own <a title="Unofficial Instagram API" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2010/12/15/the-full-featured-unpublished-instagram-api/">unofficial Instagram API.</a>
<p></p>By January <a title="Instagram shut down the rogue API" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/01/12/instagram-shuts-down-third-party-developers-plans-official-api/">Instagram shut down the rogue API</a> and announced it was building one of its own.
<p></p>Then in February of 2011, <a title="Instagram released the official API" href="http://instagr.am/blog/40/instagram-api">Instagram released the official API</a> for the photo platform.
<p></p>Within days many <a title="Instagram Photo Applications" href="http://instagre.at/#/by/knorrstein/35938336">photo applications</a>, photo -sharing sites, and mashups built around the API started showing up.
<p></p>Instagram became a viral iPhone app sensation, but quickly needed an API to realize its full potential.
