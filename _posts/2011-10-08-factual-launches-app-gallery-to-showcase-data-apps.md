{% include JB/setup %}<p>Factual has launch a new application gallery to showcase the diverse number of applications built using data provided by Factual.You can search for apps, browse by category, and filter by open source, paid or free apps. Looks like there are about 18 apps in the directory currently ranging from augmented reality to daily deals.The Factual App Gallery isn’t a particularly unique launch, we are seeing app showcases popup within many APIs, but it shows that Factual is gaining steam, and I think it shows the appetite for building apps around datasets is growing.</p>
