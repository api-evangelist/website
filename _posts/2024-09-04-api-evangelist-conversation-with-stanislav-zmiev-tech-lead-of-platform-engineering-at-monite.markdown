I came across a [post on LinkedIn from Alex Akimov, the CTO of Monite, sharing their strategy for versioning their API](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7234906102880964608/). I knew that I wanted to get [Stanislav Zmiev, the Tech Lead of Platform Engineering at Monite](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zmievsa/), and the person behind their API versioning on the show. Versioning is an important and hot topic, and Stanislav delivered with a very wise, pragmatic, and fortunate for all of us, an open-source solution to managing change across our APIs.

Stanislav knows his stuff when it comes to versioning, and it shows in their [open-source implementation called Cadwyn](https://docs.cadwyn.dev/), which as they say, is a “Production-ready community-driven modern Stripe-like API versioning in FastAPI”. Stanislav shared both the business and technical reasons behind when you want to version or not version, and provides us all with a very pragmatic view of API versioning, which is often a heated and confusing topic. Well, I’ll let you listen for yourself...

I am going to dig into Cadwyn and learn more. I want to learn more about the technical approach they use as part of FastAPI, but I also want to understand the philosophical approach he emulated from Stripe. I like the way he dismissed me asking if Stripe was a standard, and focused on the importance of hitching his approach to Stripe’s wagon from a storytelling perspective. People know Stripe. Stripe is successful. Thus, let’s use their approach to versioning. It might not be what you need in all cases, but it provides a damn good starting point.

As we closed, Stanislav touched on another point I like—the importance of these API conversations. It wasn’t the usual technical puzzle challenge answer I’d expect to hear from a technologist, and it represents what we need more of in space. Talking to each other. Which is why I am doing these API Evangelist conversations. Thanks again Stanislav for joining me today to talk about versioning. Make sure and head over to [check out what Monite offers when it comes to invoicing and bill pay](https://monite.com/), and I will do some digging into [Cadwyn](https://github.com/zmievsa/cadwyn), as well as the [Monite API](https://docs.monite.com/), and see what I can’t cook up for future conversations and stories.
