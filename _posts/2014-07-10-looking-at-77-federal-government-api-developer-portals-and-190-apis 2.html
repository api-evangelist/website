<p>I spent most of the day yesterday, looking through <a href="/admin/blog/http:/18f.github.io/API-All-the-X/pages/developer_hubs">77 of the developer portals listed on the 18F Github portal</a>. While I wanted to evaluate the quality and approach of each of the agencies, my goal for this review cycle was to look for any APIs that already had machine readable API definitions, or would be low hanging fruit for the creation of <a href="http://swagger.wordnik.com/">Swagger definitions</a>, as part of my wider API discovery work.</p>
<p>I had just finished updating all my API Evangelist Network APIs to use verion 0.14 of <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, and while I wait for the search engine <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a> to update to support the new version, I wanted to see if I could start the hard work of applying API discovery to federal government APIs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ideally all federal agencies would publish APIs.json on their own, placing it within the root of their domain, like they do with data.json, and provide an index of all of their APIs. Being all to familiar with how this stuff work, I know that if I want this to happen, I will have to generate APIs.json for many federal agencies first. However for the APis.json to have their intended impact, I need many of the APIs to have machine readable API definitions that I can point to--which equals more work for me! yay? ;-(</p>
<p>My thinking is that I will look through all of the 77 developer areas, and resulting APIs looking for the low hanging fruit. Basically I would grade each API on its viability to be included in my federal government API discovery work. I spent minimal amount of time look at each API, and in some cases looking for the API, before giving up. I would inspect the supporting developer area, and the actual interface for complexity, helping me understand how hard it would be to hand craft a Swagger spec, and APIs.json for each agency and their APIs.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>(warning contains my raw un-edited notes from doing this research, not suitable for children)</em></p>
<p>As I went through, I wrote a couple of notes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/admin/blog/&lt;a href='http:/www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/'&gt;http:/www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/&lt;/a&gt;">National Climate Data Center</a> is nice looking, and is a high profile--they should have a kick ass API!</li>
<li>Inversely <a href="/admin/blog/&lt;a href='http:/www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2#gettingStarted'&gt;http:/www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2#gettingStarted&lt;/a&gt;">NOAAA Climate Data Online</a> very simple, clean and well done.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ed.gov/developers">Department of Education</a> is acceptable as dev area, only because of Socrata</li>
<li><a href="http://developer.nrel.gov/">National Renewable Energy Laboratory</a> just gets it. They just get it.</li>
<li>Some of these are billed as developer areas, but really just a single API. It is a start I guess.&nbsp;</li>
<li>I love me some <a href="http://developer.dol.gov/">Department of Labor</a>. Their developer area and API is freak'n cool!</li>
<li><a href="https://my.usa.gov/developer/">MyUSA citizen API </a>has oAuth!!! WTF. How did I not notice this before? Another story, and work here.</li>
<li>MyUSA has really good, simple, high value, API resources.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://exoapi.com/">NASA ExoAPI</a> not just API cool, but space cool!!</li>
<li><a href="http://www.foia.gov/developer.html">FOIA</a> needs a fucking API. No excuses. FOIA needs an API!</li>
<li>Some APIs it might be better to go back to data source and recreate API from scratch, they are so bad.</li>
</ul>
<p>I wanted to share some of my notes, before the long list of developer areas, and their APIs. There are some specific notes for each APIs, but much of it is very general, helping grade each API, so I can go back through the list of B grade or higher APIs, and figure out which are candidates for me to create a Swagger API definition, APIs.json and ultimately adding to APIs.io.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For this work I went down the <a href="http://18f.github.io/API-All-the-X/pages/developer_hubs">77 federal agency links</a>, which were billed as developer areas, but many were single APIs. So when a developer area resulted in multiple APIs, I grouped them together, and many of the agencies who have a single API I will group together, and include my commentary as necessary. I'm leaving the URLs visible to help as a reference, show the craziness of some of them, and because it would have been sooooo much work to apply all of them.</p>
<p>Let's start with the <strong>White House</strong>(<a href="/admin/blog/&lt;a href='http:/www.whitehouse.gov/developers'&gt;http:/www.whitehouse.gov/developers&lt;/a&gt;"></a><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/developers">http://www.whitehouse.gov/developers</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="/admin/blog/&lt;a href='https:/petitions.whitehouse.gov/developers'&gt;https:/petitions.whitehouse.gov/developers&lt;/a&gt;">White House Petition API</a>&nbsp;-</strong> No swagger, but simple, high value API that is totally worth doing.<strong> (B)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Next up is the <strong>USDA</strong>&nbsp;(<a href="http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome?navid=USDA_DEVELOPER">http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome?navid=USDA_DEVELOPER</a>), which is a hodgepodge of service, no consistency whatsoever between services in interface, supporting content or anything.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Farmers Market Directory API</strong> - <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://search.ams.usda.gov/farmersmarkets/v1/svcdesc.html">http://search.ams.usda.gov/farmersmarkets/v1/svcdesc.html</a></span> - worthwhile API, but soap,</li>
<li><strong>Animal Identification Management Syste</strong>m - <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://vsapps.aphis.usda.gov/aims/">https://vsapps.aphis.usda.gov/aims/</a></span> - Meh</li>
<li><strong>ERS Content API&nbsp; -</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.ers.usda.gov/developer/website-content-api.aspx">http://www.ers.usda.gov/developer/website-content-api.aspx</a></span> - Really rough.</li>
<li>National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) Status Web Service - <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.fsa.usda.gov/Internet/FSA_File/usage_guide_naipstatus_final.pdf">http://www.fsa.usda.gov/Internet/FSA_File/usage_guide_naipstatus_final.pdf</a></span> - PDF bitches. Barf.</li>
<li><strong>Recreation Information Database&nbsp; -</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://ridb.recreation.gov/">https://ridb.recreation.gov/</a></span> - Kinda sort of cool</li>
<li><strong>Cropland Data Layer -</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.nass.usda.gov/research/Cropland/sarsfaqs2.html#_Cropscape1.2">http://www.nass.usda.gov/research/Cropland/sarsfaqs2.html#_Cropscape1.2</a></span> - What What? Not an API?</li>
<li><strong>Quick Stats -</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/api">http://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/api</a></span> - What What ? Not an API, a tleast can't find it.</li>
<li><strong>National Water and Climate Center AWDB database -</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.wcc.nrcs.usda.gov/web_service/AWDB_Web_Service_Tutorial.htm">http://www.wcc.nrcs.usda.gov/web_service/AWDB_Web_Service_Tutorial.htm</a></span></li>
<li><strong>Soil Data Mart -</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://sdmdataaccess.nrcs.usda.gov/">http://sdmdataaccess.nrcs.usda.gov/</a></span> - SOAP, yuck!</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall I give USDA a <strong>D</strong> on all their APIs. A couple might be high value sources, and going after, but definitely not low hanging fruit for me. It would be easier to tackle as independent project for generating brand new APIs.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Economic Research Service</strong> - <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.ers.usda.gov/developer.aspx#.U732Mo1dU_2">http://www.ers.usda.gov/developer.aspx#.U732Mo1dU_2</a></span>&nbsp;- Almost there. The landing page looks good, but the API documentation isn't really there. Could be really easily. Looks like a well crafted API.<strong> (B)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Next up is Department of Commerce (<a href="http://www.commerce.gov/developer">http://www.commerce.gov/developer</a>), who definitely high some higher value resources, as well as some health API initiatives.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bureau of Economic Analysis API -</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://bea.gov/API/signup/index.cfm">http://bea.gov/API/signup/index.cfm</a> -&nbsp;</span>Signed up for key, don&rsquo;t see any docs? Looks clean, but we&rsquo;ll see if anything there. An email address. yay!<strong> (C)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Census Bureau API -</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.census.gov/developers/">http://www.census.gov/developers/</a></span>&nbsp;- Yes, a real developer area with supporting building blocks. (Update, News, App Gallery, Forum, Mailing List).&nbsp;Really could use interactive document though. There are urls, but not active calls. Would be way easier if you could play with data, before committing. <strong>(B)</strong></li>
<li><strong>International Trade Administration Export Trade Events -</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://new.export.gov/events">https://new.export.gov/events</a></span>&nbsp;- Don&rsquo;t see an API<strong> (F)</strong></li>
<li><strong>National Institute of Standards and Technology CDA Guideline Validation Tool -&nbsp; </strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://ihe-pcd-con.nist.gov/PCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConcda-validation/webservice.html">http://ihe-pcd-con.nist.gov/PCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConPCD-HL7WebConcda-validation/webservice.html</a></span>&nbsp;- WTF is with this URL? Really? 404 <strong>(F)</strong></li>
<li>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Meteorological Assimilation Data Ingest System - <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://madis.noaa.gov/madis_api_doc.html">http://madis.noaa.gov/madis_api_doc.html</a></span>&nbsp;- Not really a web API. If I could find data, it would be a good facade project. <strong>(C)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Legacy National Climatic Data Center RESTful Services -</strong> <a href="http://www7">http://www7</a>.<span style="text-decoration: underline;">ncdc.noaa.gov/rest/</span>&nbsp;- Wouldn&rsquo;t take much to build a facade for this one, so that it would be a real API. As it is, its just too confusing. Simple, but confusing. Takes talent to do that. <strong>(C)</strong></li>
<li><strong>GIS Map Services -</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.climate.gov/datasearch/">http://www.climate.gov/datasearch/</a></span>&nbsp;- Looks like a bunch of datasets, no real API found.

<li>Severe Weather Data Inventory - <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/swdiws/">http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/swdiws/</a></span>&nbsp;- Fairly basic interface, wouldn&rsquo;t take much to turn into modern web API. Right now its just a text file, with a spec style documentation explaining what to do. Looks high value. <strong>(B)</strong></li>
<li><strong>General National Climatatic Data Center THREDDS Data Server -</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/thredds/catalog.html">http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/thredds/catalog.html</a></span>&nbsp;- File store with folders and folder and folders of data. If deemed high value, it could be turned into API, but isn&rsquo;t one now.<strong> (D)</strong></li>
<li><strong>National Climatic Data Center Climate Data Online Web Services </strong>- <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2">http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2</a> -&nbsp;</span>Oh yeah, now we are talking. That is an API. No interactive docs, but nice clean ones, and would be some work, but could be done.<strong> (A)</strong></li>
<li><strong>National Digital Forecast Database SOAP Web Service -</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://graphical.weather.gov/xml/">http://graphical.weather.gov/xml/</a></span>&nbsp;- SOAP service. Could have a facade built turning into a web API, but would be a lot of work. Only if high value.<strong> (D)</strong></li>
<li>Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services - <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://opendap.co-ops.nos.noaa.gov/axis/">http://opendap.co-ops.nos.noaa.gov/axis/</a></span>&nbsp;- SOAP service. Could have a facade built turning into a web API, but would be a lot of work. Only if high value.&nbsp;<strong>(D)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Environmental Research Division's Data Access Program -</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/rest.html">http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/rest.html</a></span>&nbsp;- Looks like a decent web API. Wouldn&rsquo;t be too much to generate a machine readable definition and make into a better API area.&nbsp;<strong>(B)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Space Physics Interactive Data Resource Web Services -</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://spidr.ngdc.noaa.gov/spidr/docs/SPIDR.REST.WSGuide.en.pdf">http://spidr.ngdc.noaa.gov/spidr/docs/SPIDR.REST.WSGuide.en.pdf</a></span>&nbsp;- Well its a PDF, but looks like a decent web API. It would be some work but could turn into a decide API with Swagger specs.&nbsp;<strong>(B)</strong></li>
<li><strong>National Telecommunications and Information Administration -</strong> National Broadband Map - <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www2.ntia.doc.gov/broadband-data">http://www2.ntia.doc.gov/broadband-data</a></span>&nbsp;- Not an API, but dataset, with a lot of work it could be turned into a decent experience. <strong>(C</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>Patent and Trademark Office - </strong>Trademark Status &amp; Document Retrieval - <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://tsdr.uspto.gov/">http://tsdr.uspto.gov/</a></span>&nbsp;- I don&rsquo;t see any API, just a web search? <strong>(C)</strong></li>
<li>International Trade Administration -&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://developer.trade.gov/">http://developer.trade.gov/</a></span>&nbsp;- I didn&rsquo;t see any API. They talk about it, but don&rsquo;t see how to access.<strong> (F)</strong></li>
<li><strong>National Weather Service -</strong>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://graphical.weather.gov/xml/">http://graphical.weather.gov/xml/</a></span>&nbsp;- SOAP service. Could have a facade built turning into a web API, but would be a lot of work. Only if high value.<strong> (D)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services -</strong>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/api/">http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/api/</a></span>&nbsp;- Fairly straightforward API, Simple. Wouldn&rsquo;t be hard to generate interactive docs for it. Spec needed. <strong>(B)</strong></li>
<li><strong>National Climate Data Center -</strong>&nbsp;<a href="/admin/blog/&lt;a href='http:/www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/'&gt;http:/www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/&lt;/a&gt;"></a><a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/">http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/</a>&nbsp;- Sexy site, well done. But no API. Datasets, so API could be created. Cache API. <strong>(C)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Next with the <strong>Department of Defense (</strong><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.defense.gov/developer/">http://www.defense.gov/developer/</a>)</span></span><span>There are 8 things billed as aPIs, with a variety of datasets, API like things, and web services available.&nbsp; Not really sure whats up? <strong>(D)</strong></span></p>
<p>We have one by itself here:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Arlington National Cemetary -</strong>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.arlingtoncemetery.mil/Developer/">http://www.arlingtoncemetery.mil/Developer/</a></span>&nbsp;- Pretty decent web API. Poor presentation, but well designed so it wouldn&rsquo;t be hard to generate machine readable sec. <strong>(B)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Then the department of education who is just riding their data.gov work as API area:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Department of Education -</strong>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.ed.gov/developers">http://www.ed.gov/developers</a></span>&nbsp;- Lots of high value datasets. Says API, but is JSON file. Wouldn&rsquo;t be hard to generate APIs for it all and make machine readable definitions.<strong> (B)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Next some energy related efforts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Department of Energy -</strong>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.energy.gov/developers">http://www.energy.gov/developers</a></span>&nbsp;- Lots of datasets. Pretty presentation.&nbsp; Could use some simple APIs,. Wouldn&rsquo;t be much to pick high value data sets and create cache of them. <strong>(C)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Energy Information Administration -</strong>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.eia.gov/developer/">http://www.eia.gov/developer/</a></span>&nbsp;- Nice web API, simple clean presentation. Needs interactive docs.<strong> (B)</strong></li>
<li><strong>National Renewable Energy Laboratory -</strong>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://developer.nrel.gov/">http://developer.nrel.gov/</a></span>&nbsp;- Close to a modern Developer area with web APIs. Uses standardized access (umbrella). Some of them have Swagger specs, the rest would be easy to create.<strong> (A)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Office of Scientific and Technical Information -</strong>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.osti.gov/XMLServices">http://www.osti.gov/XMLServices</a></span>&nbsp;- Interfaces are pretty well designed, and Swagger specs would be straightforward. But docs are all PDF currently. <strong>(B)</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Ok that was it. I know there are more APIs to look at, but this is derived from the master list of federal government developer portals. This gives me what I need. Although, I'm a little disappointed I have less than 5 Swagger definitions, after looking at about 190 APIs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After looking at all of this, I'm overwhelmed. How do you solve API discovery for a mess like this? Holy shit!</p>
<p>I really need my fucking head examined for taking this shit on. I really am my own worst enemy, but I love it. I am obsessed with contributing to a solution for API discovery that will work in private sector, as well as a public sector mess like this. So where the hell do I start? &nbsp;More to come on that soon...</p>
