<p>
     In 2012 I’m going to be stepping up my travel schedule. I”m planning on attending as many conferences, hackathons and meetups as I possibly can.
</p>
<p>
     My emphasis will be on hackathons and meetups, but there are still some very worthy larger conferences that I will make sure and be at.
</p>
<p>
     I believe that in 2012 there will be some serious innovation occurring around Hackathons in cities around the globe, and I want to be there for as much of it as I can.
</p>
<p>
     Tonight I added some filters to the <a title="events page" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/events/">events page</a> so you can filter down by month, city, country and time period. I’m trying to make it so I can plan each month and easily plan which events I will be at.
</p>
<p>
     You can filter and see events on the events page, and also subscribe to individuals Google Calendars for <a title="conference" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/events_conference_calendar.php">conferences,</a> <a title="hackathons" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/events_hackathon_calendar.php">hackathons</a> and <a title="meetups" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/events_meetups_calendar.php">meetups</a>.
</p>
<p>
     I track these separately, because important conferences tend to steer where I end-up, but more often hackathons in important cities are affecting my travel decisions. With meetups being an important way to fill my time while I’m in a town for a conference or other hackathon.
</p>
<p>
     These are my research tools, and I’m doing my best to keep up to date. Feel free to <a title="Contact Me" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/contact.php">contact me</a>, if you are having an event or know of an event I should be tracking on.
