{% include JB/setup %}One of the keys to YouTube's success as a video sharing platform is its successful API that allows developers and site owners to embed, share and distribute YouTube content across the Intertubes. <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Youtube-Google-Code-Screenshot.PNG"  width="375" align="right" /> As with many of its other products, Google starts with the essential API ecosystem building blocks:
<ul>
     <li>Dashboard
     </li>
     <li>Quickstart
     </li>
     <li>Docs
     </li>
     <li>Sample Code
     </li>
     <li>Forum
     </li>
     <li>Articles
     </li>
     <li>Blog
     </li>
</ul>In addition, YouTube really support its partner and developers with:
<ul>
     <li>Partners Showcase
     </li>
     <li>App Gallery
     </li>
     <li>Widgets
     </li>
     <li>White Label Player
     </li>
</ul>Google also enforces brand integrity with a few tools:
<ul>
     <li>Branding Guidelines
     </li>
     <li>Compatibility
     </li>
     <li>Terms
     </li>
</ul>Google definitely has a solid formula for replicating its API ecosystems in its different products, and the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/overview.html">YouTube developer area</a> is an excellent example of this formula being applied to a media API.
Like Google's other projects, YouTube utilizes <a href="http://code.google.com">Google Code</a> as the repository for its API community and code.
