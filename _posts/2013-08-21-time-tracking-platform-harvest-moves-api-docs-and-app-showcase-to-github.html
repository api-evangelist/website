<p><a title="Time Tracking Platform Harvest" href="http://www.getharvest.com/" target="_blank">Time Tracking API platform Harvest</a> has embraced Github as part of their API ecosystem. I'm always on the hunt for examples of API providers using Github, so I figured I'd showcase Harvest's creative use of the social coding platform.</p>
<p>Starting with their documentation, the Harvest team has moved the <a href="https://github.com/harvesthq/api">API documentation to a Github repository</a>, allowing developers to "watch" the API, get updates when changes are made, asks questions or even contribute to the API docs by submitting a pull request.</p>
<p>Harvest is also using the wiki portion of their Github repo for a developer application gallery they are calling <a href="https://github.com/harvesthq/api/wiki/Community-Creations-&amp;-Hacks">Community Creations and Hacks</a>, where they showcase innovative uses of the Harvest API--currently displaying 20 integrations by Harvest users.</p>
<p>I'm currently tracking on <a title="11 separate uses of Github for API management" href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/06/08/api-management-using-github/">11 separate uses of Github for API management</a>, and always on the hunt for new ways to use Github to support API ecosystems. Nice move Harvest!</p>
