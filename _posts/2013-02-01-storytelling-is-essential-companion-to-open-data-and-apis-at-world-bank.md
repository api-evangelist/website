     I had the pleasure of being on stage with Tim Herzog (<a rel="user" href="http://twitter.com/tgherzog" target="_blank"><span >@tgherzog</a>), a Open Data Specialist from the <a title="World Bank" href="http://worldbank.com">World Bank</a> yesterday at the <a href="/2013/02/01/a-conversation-about-apis-in-washington-dc/">DC API meetup at NPR</a>. During the QA panel, at the end of the meetup, a question came from the audience, stating that open data from government is often boring, and thus is the reason much of what we see built on government isn't that exciting--alluding that there has to be more high value, exciting data that isn't being released.
</p>
<p>
     While I agree that much of the data made available from open government initiatives is boring and stale, and there are probably much better datasets available, I also think this is more of a storytelling problem, than a data problem. After the question was asked, I quickly answered by pointing to my left at Tim Herzog, and said the World Bank does an awesome job at this.

     If you look through the <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/">World Bank data catalog</a>, and spend time looking through their blog, you see a symbiotic relationship between their open data, APIs and the stories they tell on the blog. This approach is similar to what I'm calling <a title="Hacker Storytelling" href="http://hackerstorytelling.com">Hacker Storytelling</a>, the only difference is I am hosting all my stories on Github as individual repositories.
</p>
<p>
     If you look at the home page of the World Bank data site today, there is a link to the blog post, "<a href="http://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/what-does-data-tell-us-about-debt-of-high-income-and-developing-countries">What does data tell us about debt of high income and developing countries?</a>" This is a great example of not just providing a dataset, but actually telling the story around the data, while providing tools that let you interact with the data, making everything a very hands on experience--increasing the chances users will make an emotional connection with the data.
