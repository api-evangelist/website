{% include JB/setup %}<p>Next generation payment platform Dwolla just revamped the home page of their developer center to speak to the widest audience possible.When you land at developers.dwolla.com you are given two options: I can code - You know the difference between Java and JavaScript and just want to dive into our API documentation I dont code - Youre a non-technical executive, the master of partnerships and products, and want to know why Dwolla is right for you This is an approach Ive been long advocating for, and rarely see in API areas.The best case study I always point out is the LinkedIn developers area, who provide buttons, widgets and embeddable tools that non-developers can put to use.</p>
