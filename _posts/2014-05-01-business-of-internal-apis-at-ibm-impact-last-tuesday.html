<p>I spoke on the business of internal APIs at the <a href="https://www-01.ibm.com/software/websphere/events/impact/">IBM Impact conference in Las Vegas</a>, this last Tuesday. About 15 people attended my talk, but the conversations I had with folks afterwards, signaled to me that my talk was a success.
<p>I do not expect IBM or the enterprise to listen to my brand of API evangelism, but I&rsquo;m still determined to better understand the collision of the enterprise with the open  world of web APIs. Even if I convert just one or two individuals at any event, my mission was a success.

<p>Impressed that IBM invited <a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane">@kinlane</a> to speak at <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23IBMImpact&amp;src=hash">#IBMImpact</a>. Maybe this isn&rsquo;t your father&rsquo;s IBM!

<p>As I walked around the event talking to people I was reminded of how hungry the enterprise is for conversation about the API space that aren&rsquo;t linked to a product or particular company. As soon as people realize I have no sales pipeline, and I&rsquo;m genuinely trying to understand the space, and help them be successful, the tone always shifts dramatically.
<p>You can find my <a href="https://kinlane.github.io/talks/ibm/impact-2014/" target="_blank">slide deck for the talk on Github</a>, unfortunately its in my minimalist style, so you need to have my narration&mdash;maybe I&rsquo;ll work on longer post to summarize what I covered during the talk. I&rsquo;ll have more thoughts on my experience at IBM Impact in Vegas, but will publish as separate posts across <a href="http://kinlane.com">Kin Lane</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>.
