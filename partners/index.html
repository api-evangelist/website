title: API Evangelist Partners
---

<p>API Evangelist exists because of its partners. Without them I wouldn't be able to do the research I do, focus on the important issues like API copyright, and other critical aspects of the API industry.</p>
<h2>Soul Partner</h2>
<p>The one partner that sees the space as I do, invests in the API community, and has been essential to the last couple years of operations of API Evangelist.</p>

<h2>Brand Partners</h2>
<p>These are the select partners I'm happy to showcase alongside the API Evangelist brand, and I give them my time and energy for monthly financial support of what I do.</p>

<h2>Content Partners</h2>
<p>These are the select partners that I believe in what they are doing, and work to craft stories, specifications, tooling, and other resources focused on what they do in the space.</p>
