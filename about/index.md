title: About API Evangelist
---
My name is Kin Lane, and I created the API Evangelist blog and persona to provide me with a lens for looking at how technology is impacting the world around us. In 2010, I began studying the business of APIs, trying to understand how new waves of startups like Twilio, Stripe, SendGrid and others were building API-centric businesses. Many years later I am still studying APIs, but my view of the API landscape has significantly changed over the years as I better understand the technology, business, but also the politics of APIs.

My API journey has spanned almost 15 years, exposing me to a wealth of lessons across the following experiences:

Throughout this journey I have written over 4K posts here on API Evangelist, produced 125 episodes of [my Breaking Changes podcast](https://apievangelist.com/videos/), and engaged in many discussions and working sessions with enterprise organizations regarding their API operations, lifecycle, and governance. The next part of my journey is all about taking what I've learned and evolve a suite of services that help enterprises get a handle on their APIs.

Every engagement with API Evangelist begins with [an API contract that can be tailored to fit your perspective](https://apievangelist.com/contracts/), [provide solutions to your top pain points](https://apievangelist.com/solutions/), and provide [API governance services](https://apievangelist.com/services/) as part of your enterprise operations. Take me on as an advisor to your API platform and governance efforts, and I will bring my experience along for the ride, and work through the tactical and strategic aspects of governing your API operations alongside you and your team.
