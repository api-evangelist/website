This is the official repository of API Evangelist guidance, providing free and paid guidance that can be applied across enterprise API operations. This website runs 100% on GitHub using GitHub pages, making most of the content available publicly, however every piece of guidance possesses additional information that only customers with active API contracts will see.

While API Evangelist has been 100% open since 2010, as of 2024 some of the knowledge accumulated will be made available only to customers and partners of API Evangelist. This guidance has been accumulated as part of 14 years of API Evangelist, four years as Chief Evangelist at Postman, and 1 year leading API governance at Bloomberg. My goal is to take everything I've learned, and continuing to learn through my work with customers and partners, and make available to you.
