    This guidance is published as YAML available in the repository powering API Evangelist, and will only pull when you, or team members have access to the repository--which is enabled anytime a new API contract is initiated. This guidance will then be available via any contract and review, to help drive more awareness around the maintenance of API contracts.
business: >-
    API guidance has been the top thing slowing down enterprise organizations, leaving teams without the knowledge they need to consistently deliver high quality APIs. This guidance is designed for both technical and non-technical users, providing the on-demand knowledge your teams need while supporting your partners and customers using APIs.
politics: >-
    Without proper guidance, the teams who are producing APIs will struggle with common aspects of API operations. Without consistent guidance across teams, APIs produced across the enterprise will all be different, slowing the overall business velocity. On-demand API guidance is how you can educate individual teams, while also establishing alignment across teams.
governance: >-
    All API guidance is linked within the description of the rules applied across API operations. This API guidance is accessible as a whole via this left hand navigation, with free public content, as well as private customer content, but more importantly is is one click away while reviewing, validating, and certifying each individual API contract that is active via API Evangelist today.

This is the official repository of API Evangelist guidance, providing free and paid guidance that can be applied across enterprise API operations. This website runs 100% on GitHub using GitHub pages, making most of the content available publicly, however every piece of guidance possesses additional information that only customers with active API contracts will see.

While API Evangelist has been 100% open since 2010, as of 2024 some of the knowledge accumulated will be made available only to customers and partners of API Evangelist. This guidance has been accumulated as part of 14 years of API Evangelist, four years as Chief Evangelist at Postman, and 1 year leading API governance at Bloomberg. My goal is to take everything I've learned, and continuing to learn through my work with customers and partners, and make available to you.
