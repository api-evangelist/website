    APIs.json identifiers are used to apply overlays and help with API discovery by connecting different APIs.json artifacts using a single unique identifier. Identifiers can be defined by API producers, but then can be used by other services and tooling to understand the source of truth for each individual APis.json.
business: >-
    Books have International Standard Book Number (ISBN), and products have Unique Product Identifiers (UPIs), APIs need a unique identifier to help make business using APIs easier. APIs.json identifiers provide the reference to each API contract and all of the properties of the contract that matter to both the API producer and the consumer.
politics: >-
    Unique identifiers allow enable API producers to assert control over their APIs.json API contracts and organize their domain, and the bounded context that matters to their business. But, unique identifiers also give API consumers, and API solution providers a way to reference, overlay, and automate using 3rd party, 1st party, and internal APIs effectively.
governance: >-
    API contracts with unique identifiers enable the review, validation, and certification of authoritative and community-defined API contracts. Unique identifiers can be referenced by producers, but also by consumers, and the solution providers they put to work standardizing APIs and the operations around them--helping standardize the governance of enterprise APIs.

---
APIs.json identifiers are a standardized format for allowing API producers to establish a unique identifier for each API contract they provide using APIs.json, which will then be prepended to each APIs defined. You can find details about the standard for APIs.json unique identifier on API Commons [need link], and learn how to standardize your domains and apply across your API.json API contracts.
