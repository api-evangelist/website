header: As an end-user of applications you depend on for your business, you should always be ensuring that you have access to the underlying data you generate and depend on for your business. Mission critical applications require access to the APIs that power them, so you can adequately backup, automate, and sync all your applications with your internal systems.

footer: API contracts help you define the business requirements that matter to you, and help define your relationships with other businesses you depend upon. APIs are standard operating procedure today for any desktop, web, or mobile applications, and there is no reason that you as and end-user should not also have access to APIs as well.
