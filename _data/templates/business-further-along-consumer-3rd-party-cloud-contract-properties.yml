header: It is near impossible to develop applications without using 3rd-party APIs to get the digital resources and capabilities you need, raising the bar when it comes to what will need from your 3rd-party API providers as defined by the following API policies.
policies:
  - repository
  - metadata
  - documentation
  - openapi
  - getting-started
  - login
  - plans
  - authentication
  - road-map
  - change-log      
  - status
  - security     
  - support
  - feedback   
  - terms-of-service
  - privacy-policy 
  - licensing
  - policies
  - rules
footer: The policies are derived from the profiling of hundreds of public APIs across different business sectors, considering the common properties present as part of publicly available API portals. There are other properties that can be considered, but this represents the common set of policies present for 3rd party public APis.
