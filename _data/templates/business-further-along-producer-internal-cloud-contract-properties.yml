# DONE
header: Your internal APIs represent the raw resources and capabilities you depend on to power your business, and while the bar isn't as high as it is with public facing APIs, they should still possess a high bar when it comes to the policies applied across teams producing APIs.
policies:
  - repository
  - metadata
  - documentation
  - openapi
  - authentication
  - versioning
  - road-map
  - change-log       
  - status
  - performance  
  - security     
  - support  
  - policies
  - rules
footer: This is the baseline that should be expected of internal APIs, and once teams get used to why these policies are necessary, and become well versed at implementing, it will become easier to deliver APIs at a higher velocity.
