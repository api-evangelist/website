  - source-of-truth

  - feedback
  - guidance
  - provenance
footer: Contract support services can be augmented and enhanced with strategy services, but should provide the baseline support that most teams producing APIs will need within the enterprise. API contract support services will ensure that teams don't lose their way during their API journey, and are able to move forward confidently with work producing APIs.
