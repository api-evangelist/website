<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> began in July 2010 as an open research project on the API space, and specifically, the business of APIs.</p>  

<p>In 2013, API Evangelist is still an open research project on the API space, but I've just gotten better at the whole process.</p>

<p>This entire website is an open source repository, that you can <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-evangelist/tree/gh-pages">view, fork or download on Github<a>, living as a Github repository.</p>

<p>You are viewing this Github repository on the web using <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>, using a process I call <a href="http://hackerstorytelling.com">Hacker Storytelling</a>.</p>

<p>Everything you find in this repository is licensed <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CC BY-SA 3.0</a>, so you can use everything here, as long as provide attribution back, and open license anything you derive from it.</p>

<p>All I ask is you make sure, you use the logo at the top of this site, with a link back to my work wherever you use this content.</p>  

<p>My name is <a href="http://kinlane.com">Kin Lane</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane">@kinlane</a>), I am the API Evangelist, and I'm looking to educate the world about the technology, business and politics of APIs.</p>

<p>Thank you for supporting, and I hope you find as much value in this research as I do.</p>
