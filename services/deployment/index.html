<p>I am happy to assist you in the deployment of your API. There are many different ways to actually deploy an API in todays landscape, and I've seen most of the approaches during my monitoring of the space.</p>
<p>Not all teams have the resources necessary to stand up, and deploy an API internally, and I'm willing to bring the resources you ned to the table, and see to it that it gets done.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if I am what you are needing, but I'm happy to explore it with you. If I can't help you, maybe one of my network of partners can help--head over <a href="http://apievangelist.com/contact/">to my contact page, and choose the channel</a> that works for you.</p>
<p>Make sure and also look at <a href="http://apievangelist.com/services/">my wider list of API services that I offer</a>, to see if there is something else I can help you with along the way.</p>
