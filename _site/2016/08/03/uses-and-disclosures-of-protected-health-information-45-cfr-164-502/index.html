<p>I am working my way through <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?gp=&amp;SID=c441be5b4dae3a7bcd23a1c7b98bbf60&amp;mc=true&amp;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title45/45tab_02.tpl">Title 45</a>, which is the principle set of rules and regulations issued by&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Federal agencies of the United States" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_agencies_of_the_United_States">federal agencies of the United States</a>&nbsp;regarding public welfare.

<p>I am currently processing this, for use as building blocks in my privacy research:

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(d)&nbsp;<span>Standard: Uses and disclosures of de-identified protected health information</span>&mdash;(1)&nbsp;<span>Uses and disclosures to create de-identified information.</span>&nbsp;A covered entity may use protected health information to create information that is not individually identifiable health information or disclose protected health information only to a business associate for such purpose, whether or not the de-identified information is to be used by the covered entity.

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(i) Disclosure of a code or other means of record identification designed to enable coded or otherwise de-identified information to be re-identified constitutes disclosure of protected health information; and

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(g)(1)&nbsp;<span>Standard: Personal representatives.</span>&nbsp;As specified in this paragraph, a covered entity must, except as provided in paragraphs (g)(3) and (g)(5) of this section, treat a personal representative as the individual for purposes of this subchapter.
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(2)&nbsp;<span>Implementation specification: Adults and emancipated minors.</span>&nbsp;If under applicable law a person has authority to act on behalf of an individual who is an adult or an emancipated minor in making decisions related to health care, a covered entity must treat such person as a personal representative under this subchapter, with respect to protected health information relevant to such personal representation.
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(3)(i)&nbsp;<span>Implementation specification: Unemancipated minors.</span>&nbsp;If under applicable law a parent, guardian, or other person acting&nbsp;<span>in loco parentis</span>&nbsp;has authority to act on behalf of an individual who is an unemancipated minor in making decisions related to health care, a covered entity must treat such person as a personal representative under this subchapter, with respect to protected health information relevant to such personal representation, except that such person may not be a personal representative of an unemancipated minor, and the minor has the authority to act as an individual, with respect to protected health information pertaining to a health care service, if:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(A) The minor consents to such health care service; no other consent to such health care service is required by law, regardless of whether the consent of another person has also been obtained; and the minor has not requested that such person be treated as the personal representative;
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(B) The minor may lawfully obtain such health care service without the consent of a parent, guardian, or other person acting&nbsp;<span>in loco parentis,</span>&nbsp;and the minor, a court, or another person authorized by law consents to such health care service; or
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(C) A parent, guardian, or other person acting&nbsp;<span>in loco parentis</span>&nbsp;assents to an agreement of confidentiality between a covered health care provider and the minor with respect to such health care service.
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(A) If, and to the extent, permitted or required by an applicable provision of State or other law, including applicable case law, a covered entity may disclose, or provide access in accordance with &sect;164.524 to, protected health information about an unemancipated minor to a parent, guardian, or other person acting&nbsp;<span>in loco parentis</span>;
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(B) If, and to the extent, prohibited by an applicable provision of State or other law, including applicable case law, a covered entity may not disclose, or provide access in accordance with &sect;164.524 to, protected health information about an unemancipated minor to a parent, guardian, or other person acting&nbsp;<span>in loco parentis</span>; and
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(C) Where the parent, guardian, or other person acting&nbsp;<span>in loco parentis,</span>&nbsp;is not the personal representative under paragraphs (g)(3)(i)(A), (B), or (C) of this section and where there is no applicable access provision under State or other law, including case law, a covered entity may provide or deny access under &sect;164.524 to a parent, guardian, or other person acting&nbsp;<span>in loco parentis,</span>&nbsp;if such action is consistent with State or other applicable law, provided that such decision must be made by a licensed health care professional, in the exercise of professional judgment.
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(4)&nbsp;<span>Implementation specification: Deceased individuals.</span>&nbsp;If under applicable law an executor, administrator, or other person has authority to act on behalf of a deceased individual or of the individual's estate, a covered entity must treat such person as a personal representative under this subchapter, with respect to protected health information relevant to such personal representation.
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(5)&nbsp;<span>Implementation specification: Abuse, neglect, endangerment situations.</span>&nbsp;Notwithstanding a State law or any requirement of this paragraph to the contrary, a covered entity may elect not to treat a person as the personal representative of an individual if:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(i) The covered entity has a reasonable belief that:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(A) The individual has been or may be subjected to domestic violence, abuse, or neglect by such person; or
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(B) Treating such person as the personal representative could endanger the individual; and
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(ii) The covered entity, in the exercise of professional judgment, decides that it is not in the best interest of the individual to treat the person as the individual's personal representative.
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(h)&nbsp;<span>Standard: Confidential communications.</span>&nbsp;A covered health care provider or health plan must comply with the applicable requirements of &sect;164.522(b) in communicating protected health information.
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(i)&nbsp;<span>Standard: Uses and disclosures consistent with notice.</span>&nbsp;A covered entity that is required by &sect;164.520 to have a notice may not use or disclose protected health information in a manner inconsistent with such notice. A covered entity that is required by &sect;164.520(b)(1)(iii) to include a specific statement in its notice if it intends to engage in an activity listed in &sect;164.520(b)(1)(iii)(A)-(C), may not use or disclose protected health information for such activities, unless the required statement is included in the notice.
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(j)&nbsp;<span>Standard: Disclosures by whistleblowers and workforce member crime victims</span>&mdash;(1)&nbsp;<span>Disclosures by whistleblowers.</span>A covered entity is not considered to have violated the requirements of this subpart if a member of its workforce or a business associate discloses protected health information, provided that:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(i) The workforce member or business associate believes in good faith that the covered entity has engaged in conduct that is unlawful or otherwise violates professional or clinical standards, or that the care, services, or conditions provided by the covered entity potentially endangers one or more patients, workers, or the public; and
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(ii) The disclosure is to:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(A) A health oversight agency or public health authority authorized by law to investigate or otherwise oversee the relevant conduct or conditions of the covered entity or to an appropriate health care accreditation organization for the purpose of reporting the allegation of failure to meet professional standards or misconduct by the covered entity; or
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(B) An attorney retained by or on behalf of the workforce member or business associate for the purpose of determining the legal options of the workforce member or business associate with regard to the conduct described in paragraph (j)(1)(i) of this section.
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(2)&nbsp;<span>Disclosures by workforce members who are victims of a crime.</span>&nbsp;A covered entity is not considered to have violated the requirements of this subpart if a member of its workforce who is the victim of a criminal act discloses protected health information to a law enforcement official, provided that:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(i) The protected health information disclosed is about the suspected perpetrator of the criminal act; and
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(ii) The protected health information disclosed is limited to the information listed in &sect;164.512(f)(2)(i).
<p class="cita" style="padding-left: 30px;">[65 FR 82802, Dec. 28, 2000, as amended at 67 FR 53267, Aug. 14, 2002; 78 FR 5696, Jan. 25, 2013]
<p>I am working on each portion of this and considering how I can add. I do not see any reason why this can't be applied to other areas of our information, like social, electricity, and beyond. I get that health care information has been granted a special place in our digital worlds, but I think we need to asking ourselves where else this might also apply.
<p>It is tough to digest this in its full legal form. This is why I work to break them down as plain English building blocks that I can include alongside my research. If we can make turn this into an easy to read checklist that any data steward could use as best practices when crafting their own approach tot he disclosure of our information, maybe more companies will step up to the plate.
