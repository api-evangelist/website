<p>We are wasting no time getting the&nbsp;<a href="/">API Strategy &amp; Practice conference</a>&nbsp;back on track, after being put on hold because of hurricane Sandy. With the current status of New York City, it&rsquo;s subways, airports, there is no way the event could have happened--we made the right decision to cancel.
<p>We are currently discussing the best dates for rescheduling in January and February of 2013, and are hopeful that we will have date finalized next week.
<p>While we are awaiting that process we figured we&rsquo;d spend some time and discuss the session lineup for the conference. We are rather proud of the keynote, panel and session lineup we&rsquo;ve pulled together, but we feel we can make it even better.
<p>So we are going to hold a Google Hangout today at 11:30 AM PDT / 2:30 PM EDT, to discuss the API Strategy &amp; Practice session lineup and invite you to participate. If you&rsquo;d like to be a participant in the hangout, email me at&nbsp;<a title="kinlane@gmail.com" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#88e3e1e6e4e9e6edc8efe5e9e1e4a6ebe7e5"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="3b505255575a555e7b5c565a525715585456">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>and if you&rsquo;d like to just watch the hangout, follow&nbsp;<a title="@apistrat" href="https://twitter.com/apistrat">@apistrat</a>&nbsp;and we&rsquo;ll tweet out the Youtube link right before.
