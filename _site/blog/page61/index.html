        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/12/21/business-of-google-apis-2011/">Business of Google APIs 2011</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">21 Dec 2011</span>
        <p><a href="http://code.google.com/more/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/google_code.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a title="ProgrammableWeb says Google has 94 APIs" href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory/1?company=Google">ProgrammableWeb says Google has 94 APIs</a>.  I roughly count about <a href="http://code.google.com/more/">75 going through Google Code</a>.  I&rsquo;m more concerned with public web APIs, and Google has Android, Chrome and other non-web APIs, so its hard to tell.</p>
<p>In any case I would consider Google to the largest public web API owner around.  I don&rsquo;t think any other single provider, owns the number of, as well as size of public APIs, that Google does.  As with any leading API providers I think there is a lot to learn in studying their approach to API deployment and management.</p>
<p>With this in mind I wanted to take a look at the Business of Google APIs in 2011 as one of my year-end, API reflection posts.  I think there are some important lessons to be learned from the work Google did over 2011, to get their API business in order.</p>
<p>Google was already setting the theme for 2011, with the <a title="launch of Google Console in 2010" href="http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2010/11/introducing-google-apis-console-and-our.html">launch of Google Console in November 2010</a>.  The <a title="Google API Console" href="https://code.google.com/apis/console/">Google API Console</a> helps developers manage their Google API usage across all of thier sites and apps.  It was clear, Google was not just looking for a way to get a handle on how they deploy and manage large numbers of APIs, they were acknowledging developers needed a way as well.</p>
<p><a title="Google API Console" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-console/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/Google-APIs-Console-Dashboard.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a title="Google API Console" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-console/">Google API Console</a> centralized how developers managed the Google APIs they used, traffic generated via these APIs, introduced billing management for some APIs, and provided developers with project and team building tools. &nbsp;Google supports 30 APIs inside of the API Console now.</p>
<p>In 2011 Google also worked to make their <a title="Google APIs more discoverable" href="http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2011/05/google-apis-discovery-service-one-api.html">APIs more discoverable for developers</a> with the launch <a title="Google API Discovery Service" href="http://code.google.com/apis/discovery/">Google API Discovery Service</a>.  The <a title="Google API Discover Service" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-discovery-service/">Google API Discovery Service</a> provides a set of web APIs for discovering metadata across Google APIs by delivering a JSON-based API that provides a directory of supported Google APIs, and a machine-readable discovery document for each API.</p>
<p><a title="Google API Discover Service" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-discovery-service/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/google-discover-file-cabinet.png" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Now developers can integrate Google API discovery into client libraries, IDE plugins and other tools, making it easier to discover the API they need.  After providing an API discovery service,  Google followed another 2011 trend around deploying the <a title="Google API Explorer" href="https://code.google.com/apis/explorer/">Google API Explorer</a>.</p>
<p>Like other API explorers, <a title="Google API Explorer" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/08/google-api-explorer/">Google API Explorer</a> allows users to make calls and explore REST APIs using a web interface, allowing anyone to start using an API without writing any code, even when authentication using Basic Auth or OAuth is required.</p>
<p>API explorers have done a lot to improve the time it takes for developers to get up and running using an API, but nothing beats good quality code samples, and Google put some serious effort into standardized code samples that can be used across Google APIs, in multiple programming languages:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://googlecode.blogspot.com/search?updated-max=2011-09-09T15:20:00-07:00&amp;max-results=10 Google APIs"><strong>Google APIs Client Library for PHP (Beta)</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2011/09/google-apis-client-library-for-net-beta.html"><strong>Client Library for .NET (Beta)</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2011/08/new-objective-c-library-for-new.html"><strong>Objective-C library for a new generation of APIs </strong></a></li>
<li><a href="http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2011/04/google-apis-python-library-goes-to-beta.html"><strong>Google APIs Python Library goes to Beta </strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond making it easier to discover, explore and manage APIs with Google Discovery, Google Explorer and Google Console in 2011, Google also spent a lot of time addressing API security.</p>
<p><a href="https://code.google.com/oauthplayground/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Google-OAuth-2-Playground.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The first step to <a title="improving security across Google APIs by supporting SSL" href="http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2011/03/improving-security-of-google-apis-with.html">improving the security of Google APIs was by supporting SSL</a> across all Google APIs.  Next Google went all in by not just working to <a title="support OAuth across Google APIs" href="http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2011/03/making-auth-easier-oauth-20-for-google.html">support OAuth 2.0 across Google APIs</a>, they want to help developers understand OAuth 2.0, making it easier to secure applications with the standard.  To help facilitate this understanding, <a title="Google opened up the oauth playground" href="http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2011/11/oauth-20-playground-open-to-developers.ht">Google opened up the OAuth 2.0 Playground</a>, which is meant to simplify experimentation with the OAuth 2.0 protocol and APIs that use the protocol by developers.</p>
<p>With these moves by Google in 2011,  I think we can say that SSL support and OAuth 2.0 are two API security essentials that are here to stay.   After working on security, Google moved into the legal department with the introduction of a <a title="single Google APIs Terms of Service" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/12/12/google-deploys-a-single,-centralized-terms-of-use-for-apis/">single Google APIs Terms of Service</a>.</p>
<p>Google has rewritten their terms from the ground up with the goal of making them easier to understand for application developers, and one by one, redirecting each API to use the <a title="centralized, easier to use terms of service" href="http://code.google.com/apis/terms/index.html">centralized, easier to understand terms of service</a>.   At the moment it seems as though most of the APIs that use the central terms of service are content and data related APIs, like Google Moderator and Blogger, while more complex APIs like Youtube and Google Adwords still use their own terms of service.</p>
<p>Overall Google made some pretty significant improvements to get their API house in order. Of course in order to do this they also had to make some hard decision, like deciding to <a title="shut down 18 Google APIs in May" href="http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2011/05/spring-cleaning-for-some-of-our-apis.html">shut down 18 Google APIs in May</a>, which included the Google Translate API.  A decision they reversed two months later, when they decided it was better to&nbsp;<a title="offer Google Translate as a Billable API" href="/2011/08/25/paid-version-of-google-translate-api/">offer Google Translate as a billable API</a> under Google Console.</p>
<p><a title="offer Google Translate as a Billable API" href="/2011/08/25/paid-version-of-google-translate-api/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Tag-Cloud-Google-Translate.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>As the <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> I don&rsquo;t really invent any of the API approaches I write about, I try to shed light on what others are doing.  Thats what this post is all about, shedding light on how Google is conducting the business of their APIs, so we can learn from them-- the good and the bad.</p>
<p>I think its important to remember that we are all making this shit up as we go along, of course it should be based on some experience, but ultimately we are in some seriously new territory, and even some of the biggest players in this space fumble the ball.  This fact became painfully clear in an <a title="accidental post by Steve Yegge" href="https://plus.google.com/112678702228711889851/posts/eVeouesvaVX">accidental post by Googler Steve Yegge</a>, shedding light into the API strategy of not just Google, but also Amazon.</p>
<p>So what do I take from Google&rsquo;s approach to APIs in 2011?</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>API discovery is important</li>
<li>API exploration is important </li>
<li>Centralized billing and reporting are essentials</li>
<li>Good quality code samples are essential </li>
<li>Security with SSL and OAuth 2.0 for APIs is standard </li>
<li>The legal around APIs needs to be easier and standardized </li>
<li>Sometimes, APIs go away </li>
<li>We are all making this shit up as we go along </li>
</ul>
<p>A lot of this is what we already are seeing from API service providers in the space like <a title="3Scale" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/serviceproviders/3scale.php">3Scale</a>, <a title="Apigee" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/serviceproviders/apigee.php">Apigee</a>, Atmosphere and <a title="Mashery" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/serviceproviders/mashery.php">Mashery</a>. But, what I don&rsquo;t see, is anyone addressing discoverability, easy legal and centralized billing, management and reporting from a developers perspective.</p>
<p>Google is addressing all of this because its in their best interest for ALL developers to be successful, where API service providers tend to focus on the success of developers who use their client APIs, not ALL developers.</p>
<p>Well, maybe in 2012 a service provider can step up with a solution that help developers discover and manage their business and legal across &ldquo;ANY&rdquo; API, or maybe Google can open the doors to any API provider to use the Google API platform as part of any Google Apps account?</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/12/20/the-fcc-lanches-api-curation-platform-called-myfcc/">The FCC Lanches API Curation Platform Called MyFCC</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">20 Dec 2011</span>
        <p><a title="MyFCC" href="http://my.fcc.gov/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/fcc/My-FCC-Logo.png" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The FCC just launched a new platform that&nbsp;allows anyone to create, save and manage a customized page, built from widgets that pull content from FCC APIs, called <a title="MyFCC" href="http://my.fcc.gov/">MyFCC</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At first glance <a title="MyFCC" href="http://my.fcc.gov/">MyFCC</a> might look like just another dashboard or start page, but it goes much further, as an API curation platform.</p>
<p>To understand, you have to go back to the beginning and see the scope of the problem being solved.  To deliver on its promise for a more open government, the FCC didn't just want a new website, they needed a platform.  To do this the FCC embraced an API-driven methodology while building their web site, meant to standardize the way they deliver information between internal groups, government agencies and with the public.</p>
<p><a title="Seabourne" href="http://seabourneinc.com/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/seabourne-inc/Seabourne.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>At the time, the managing FCC director Steve Van Roekel, partnered with <a title="Seabourne" href="http://seabourneinc.com/">Seabourne</a> to architect a platform that could deliver on this vision.</p>
<p>The new FCC web site would start with Drupal, providing a content management system (CMS) that would allow the FCC to focus on getting a handle on its content, centralizing it, preparing it to be shared with other departments, agencies and the public.   The federal government is drowning in content, so the entry, storage and management of this content was the first problem to solve, and an open-source platform like Drupal, was an ideal solution.</p>
<p>The new Drupal web site provided public access to the content, but the FCC needed to allow sharing of content with other departments, agencies and allow the public to get at the raw data for re-use.</p>
<p><a title="MyFCC" href="http://my.fcc.gov/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/fcc/My-FCC-Available-Widgets.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<blockquote><em>"Everyone is talking about opening up data with APIs, to me it makes more sense to focus on opening up content using APIs.", says Mike Reich, owner of Seabourne.</em></blockquote>
<p>So Seabourne developed the <a title="Content API Drupal Module" href="http://seabourneinc.com/projects/contentapi/">Content API module for Drupal</a>, providing a plug-and-play API, not just for the FCC website, but for any Drupal driven website.</p>
<p>Then in April, the FCC launched their API driven content platform, stating that &ldquo;<a title="Everything Should Be An API" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/04/06/everything-should-be-an-api-says-fcc/">Everything should be an API</a>&rdquo;.   In doing so the FCC did two very significant things:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Got control over their content using an open-source content management tool</li>
<li>Made their content accessible inter-department, inter-agency and with the public using APIs</li>
</ul>
<p>Now with MyFCC the FCC is providing a dashboard that allows anyone to curate content that is made available via the FCC&rsquo;s API.   Centralized content, opened up with APIs, bundled with curation tools opens up lot of potential for data journalists, analysts, scientists and other average users to derive deeper meaning from FCC operations.</p>
<p>All of this potential is made possible through a healthy dose of open source Drupal CMS, open source Drupal modules, open data, and open APIs. That is a lot of open, and shows the commitment of the FCC.</p>
<p><a title="MyFCC" href="http://my.fcc.gov/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/fcc/My-FCC-Topic-Watcher.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I sat down with Mike, while in DC in October, when he first introduced me to <a title="Cumula Framework to Github" href="https://github.com/Cumula/framework">Cumula&nbsp;</a>, the framework that drives MyFCC.  During their work with the FCC, they have been committing the <a title="Cumula Framework to Github" href="https://github.com/Cumula/framework">Cumula framework to Github</a>, planting the seeds for a much larger vision of what the framework could do.</p>
<p>Cumula has the potential to act as curation platform for any single or group of APIs.  The MyFCC implementation is very tailored to serving up the FCC content, but the platform can act as a visual builder and dashboard for any topical area.  For example, the platform could be setup with widgets that pull medical content from various health, science and medical APIs, allowing users to create custom dashboards around the medical information most important and relevant to them.</p>
<p><a title="Cumulu" href="https://github.com/Cumula/framework">Cumula</a> is to API curation as <a title="Apigee Console" href="https://apigee.com/console/twitter">Apigee console</a> is to <a title="API exploration" href="/2011/03/24/explorers-open-api-access-beyond-developers/">API exploration</a>, <a title="Google API Discovery Service" href="http://code.google.com/apis/discovery/">Google API Discovery Service</a> is to <a title="API discovery" href="/2011/05/21/google-apis-discovery-service/">API discovery</a>, and <a title="Swagger" href="http://swagger.wordnik.com/">Swagger</a> is to interactive API documentation.   It has the potential to be the platform that the world uses to discover, pull, curate and make sense of the flood of content and data we are only just beginning to drown in, with this new API driven economy.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/12/17/google-affiliate-network-api/">Google Affiliate Network API</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">17 Dec 2011</span>
        <p><a title="Google Affiliate Network API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/gan/index.html"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/google/Google-Affiliate-Network-API.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Google just launched their new <a title="Google Affiliate Network API" href="http://code.google.com/apis/gan/index.html">Google Affiliate Network API</a>, which allows publishers and advertisers to automate various tasks related to the <a title="Google Affiliate Network" href="http://www.google.com/affiliatenetwork">Google Affiliate Network</a>.</p>
<p>The Google Affiliate Network is the affiliate network, formerly known as Doubleclick Performics, which was part of <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/press/pressrel/doubleclick.html">Google&rsquo;s Doublick acquisition in April of 2007</a>.</p>
<p>Using the new Google Affiliate Network APIs, developers can programmaticaly manage:</p>

        <p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/blueprints.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" />In my quest to fully understand the underlying principles of Representational State Transfer (REST), i'm re-reading Roy Thomas Fielding original dissertation, <a title="Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architecture" href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm">Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures</a>, where he first introduced the REST architectural style.</p>
<p>His dissertation explored the junction of two disciplines in computer science: <em>software and networking</em>.</p>
<p>He identifies that software research:</p>
<blockquote><em>...has long been concerned with the categorization of software designs and the development of design methodologies, but has rarely been able to objectively evaluate the impact of various design choices on system behavior.</em></blockquote>
<p>While networking research:</p>
<blockquote><em>...is focused on the details of generic communication behavior between systems and improving the performance of particular communication techniques, often ignoring the fact that changing the interaction style of an application can have more impact on performance than the communication protocols used for that interaction.</em></blockquote>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/parthenon.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /> Fieldings work was motivated by the desire to understand and evaluate the architectural design of network-based application software.  He wanted to rethink software design in the context of the World Wide Web.</p>
<p>The World Wide Web is intended to be an Internet-scale, distributed system, interconnecting information networks across organizational boundaries, and cope with the demands of scalability and independent deployment of software.</p>
<p>As Fielding states:</p>
<blockquote><em>REST provides a set of architectural constraints that, when applied as a whole, emphasizes scalability of component interactions, generality of interfaces, independent deployment of components, and intermediary components to reduce interaction latency, enforce security, and encapsulate legacy systems.</em></blockquote>
<p>As I'm reading his abstract and introduction I can't help but think about where I stand as an <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/04/09/api-evangelism-vs-developer-evangelism/">API Evangelist</a>, at the convergence of business and RESTful APIs.</p>
<p>When RESTful APIs are applied to business, what does this look like?  Is business currently restricted in the same ways as software?  When business is operating on the World Wide Web do we need to consider the network more?</p>
<p>Lots to consider at the intersection of business and RESTful APIs.</p>

<p>Google has made another step towards a more common API infrastructure in line with their <a title="API Discovery Service" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-discovery-service/">API Discovery Service</a>, <a title="Google API Explorer" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/03/08/google-api-explorer/">API Explorer</a>, and <a title="Google API Console" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/21/google-apis-console/">API Console</a> by launching a <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/terms/index.html">single terms of service for all Google APIs</a>.</p>
<p>Google has rewritten their terms from the ground up with the goal of making them easier to understand for application developers.</p>
<p>At the moment it seems as though most of the APIs that use the central terms of service are content and data related APIs, like <a title="Google Tasks" href="http://code.google.com/apis/tasks/terms.html">Google Tasks</a>, <a title="Google Moderator" href="http://code.google.com/apis/moderator/terms.html">Google Moderator</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Google Charts" href="http://code.google.com/apis/chart/terms.html">Google Charts</a> and <a title="Blogger" href="http://code.google.com/apis/blogger/terms.html">Blogger</a>.</p>
<p>While more complex APIs like <a title="Youtube Terms of Service" href="http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/terms.html">Youtube</a>, <a title="Google Analytics" href="http://www.google.com/analytics/tos.html">Google Analytics</a>, <a title="Google Adwords Terms of Service" href="http://code.google.com/apis/adwords/docs/terms.html">Google Adwords</a> and <a title="Google Latitude" href="http://code.google.com/apis/latitude/terms.html">Google Latitude</a> still use their own terms of service.  Over time, more APIs will be migrated to the new, centralized terms of service format.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With almost 100 APIs now, it makes sense for Google to reduce the complexity of terms of use across APIs, increasing the chances a developer will &ldquo;legally&rdquo; build an application or business around one or multiple Google APIs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Google provides tools for developers to easily discover, explore their APIs, while also providing centralized management of billing, usage reporting and terms of use. &nbsp;I predict we will see other API service providers offering tools for managing <a title="terms of use" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/buildingblocks/terms_of_use__conditions.php">terms of use</a>, <a title="branding" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/buildingblocks/branding.php">branding</a> and other legal aspects of API management in 2012.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Dec 2011</span>
        <p>
     <a title="4,480 APIs in the Directory" href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/programmableweb/ProgrammableWeb-API-Directory.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a>
</p>
<p>
     I recently pulled the title, description and tags for all the APIs in the <a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://www.programmableweb.com">ProgramableWeb</a> directory into a local MySQL database. At the time of this writing there are <a title="4,480 APIs in the Directory" href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory">4,480 public APIs in the directory</a>.
</p>
<p>
     My goal is build a better search and discovery interface, so I can get a handle on all these APIs. Which ones I should be paying attention to, recommending to developers and generally just have an awareness of what types of APIs are available.
</p>
<p>
     Where do I start?
</p>
<p>
     First I start with a keyword search on the title, description and tags associated with each API. I will build a bunch of custom search queries, but no matter how good my queries are, I’m still limited by whatever descriptions are associated with the APIs and whatever tags were applied. This is just search, it isn’t discovery or real-time tracking.
</p>
<p>
     Having gone through whole categories of image APIs and storage APIs by hand I know there is a lot of crap APIs that aren’t in my opinion, real API efforts. They just throw up an API, register it with ProgrammableWeb and don’t actually have a supporting area for developers.
</p>
<p>
     I need a way to programmatically rank each API while searching through APIs. When I search for photo management APIs, I want them sorted by some sort of value. Currently ProgrammableWeb uses the number of mashups of an API as a “popularity” ranking. I need more and I figured <a title="Compete" href="https://www.compete.com/developer/">Compete</a> and <a title="Alexa" href="http://www.alexa.com/">Alexa</a> APIs could give me some sense of the value of each API based upon its domain. This is just a start and I want to establish a <a title="wide variety of metrics for measuring the value delivered by an API" href="/2011/04/21/measuring-the-popularity-of-apis/">wide variety of metrics for measuring the value delivered by an API</a>.
</p>
<p>
     My API ranking algorithm is obviously a work in progress. I just figured I’d tell the story of how I evolve my API ranking algorthm here, and leave open for comment and others to add to. But as I work to make sense of 4,480 APIs, I can’t help but think--what does a world with 100K open APIs look like?

</p>
<p>
     <a title="Hackathons" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/events/">Hackathons</a> are growing into a popular way to spark innovation around hardware, data and APIs within developer and hacker communities. I count over 40 hackathons going on in December alone, and this is just what I can discover and keep up with in my research.
</p>
<p>
     Hackathons are also being used by many companies to drive innovation internally between departments. Businesses like <a title="LinkedIn" href="http://blog.linkedin.com/category/linkedin-hackdays/">LinkedIn</a> and <a title="Zappos" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/07/19/how-zappos-drives-internal-innovation-with-its-public-api/">Zappos</a> employ Hackathons and Hack Days internally to get recreate this same hackathon phenomenon within their own companies, in a much more controlled, safe environment.
</p>
<p>
     Now Zappos is going even further and opening up their Internal Hackathon to the public. December 12th through the 16th of 2011 they are holding the <a title="Zappos API Hackathon" href="http://developer.zappos.com/blog/zappos-api-hackathon-hack-long-contest">Zappos API Hackathon Hack-a-long</a>, which in the past, has been an event open only to Zappos employees, but this year, they want the public to hack alongside of Zappos employees.
</p>
<p>
     On Monday, Dec 12th, Zappos will post a theme on their blog, and developers will have one week to hack up a project that fits in with the theme. Zappos will be awarding three $100 gift cards for <a title="Zappos.com" href="http://www.Zappos.com">Zappos.com</a> to the winners in three categories: Best Mashup, Best Overall, and Most Fun and Weird.
</p>
<p>
     Public developer apps will be presented along side internal Zappos employee projects, during their Hackathon Open House. The goal of the event is to help inspire Zappos developers and expose them to the passion and creative juices of the public Zappos developer community.
</p>
<p>
     I’m spending a lot of time tracking on the evolving Hackathon phenonemon and how these events are spurring innovating both internally within companies and externally in public developer communities in cities around the globe. I’ll keep tracking on the innovation and talent coming out of hackathons and I am excited to see more companies adopt them internally and even inviting the public to come participate in the hacking!

</p>
<p>
     Its a pretty straightforward post about the San Francisco based start-up, that gets you in touch with friendly, reliable people who can help you get just about anything you need done. At first glance, it is a pretty standard post. However I feel there are two things very notable about this post and more specifically, it’s title:
</p>
<blockquote>
     <em>TaskRabbit Looks to Expand Cities and Offer an A.P.I.</em>
</blockquote>
<p>
     One, the launching of an API is tied directly to the startups expansion into other cities. Those of us in the know, understand the important role an API plays in scaling your company, but explaining this to mainstream audiences is so important.
</p>
<p>
     Two, that the acronym "API" gets used in a title of a mainstream publication like the New York Times.  Of course they spell it out in the article, but the editor expects that the user will understand the acronym in the title.
</p>
<p>
     There are many API stories in 2011, but I think this really shows APIs are coming of age, when it is acceptable for a wider, mainstream audience to accept the term into their vocabulary.
</p>
<p>
     One of the things I like about APIs is they are a silent, but powerful force behind many industry sectors including e-commerce, social, cloud computing and mobile computing. I think this use of API in the NYT represent classic API style, a silent coming of age, showing APIs are being adopted by a mainstream audience.

     There was a post in the Atlantic about Twitter’s advertising network called, <a title="No One's Noticing Twitter's New Ad Experiment, Which is a Good Thing" href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/technology/2011/11/no-ones-noticing-twitters-new-ad-experiment-which-good-thing/45143/">No One's Noticing Twitter's New Ad Experiment, Which Is a Good Thing</a>.
</p>
<p>
     Twitter is dropping what they call “promoted tweets” into users timelines. Adam Clark Estes of the Atlantic states:
</p>
<blockquote>
     <em>Despite months of hemming and hawing over the danger of polluting the sacred Twitter feed, the few people that have taken notice seem reasonably pleased by the hands-off approach.</em>
</blockquote>
<p>
     A user, also cited in the article, Ellis Hamburger at Business Insider thinks the approach is awesome:
</p>
<blockquote>
     <em>I realized that Promoted Tweets really aren't that much different from TV commercials—brief interruptions from your content.</em>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
     <em>Except they're not very annoying. …</em>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
     <em>Twitter's commercials are different and have a leg up because they will be intermixed with incredibly time-sensitive content. They're also brief, which helps. And a lot of of the time, Promoted Tweets are from celebrities who tweet their thoughts in their own voice.</em>
</blockquote>
<p>
     I’m following Twitter’s rollout of their advertising network because its a big deal to finally see the popular micro-blogging platform finally move towards monetizing the network--even if some don’t like it. But I think the work Twitter is doing has even bigger implications, on the future of online advertising, even beyond social media.
</p>
<p>
     The Internets seem to be stuck in a rut, when it comes to monetization of our online real estate. There isn’t much innovation beyond the classic online and slightly newer mobile advertising platforms dominated by Google and a handful of others. What is next?
</p>
<p>
     <a title="advertising network dedicated to APIs" href="/2011/09/28/advertising-network-dedicated-to-apis-and-developers/"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Tag-Cloud-API-Advertising.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a>
</p>
<p>
     APIs of course. As APIs also struggle to develop their monetization strategies, they tend to default to charging for their services, with some API providers like <a title="CityGrid" href="http://www.citygridmedia.com/">CityGrid</a> are providing mobile and web advertising solutions alongside their APIs.
</p>
<p>
     I feel what Twitter is doing is one possible model for other API owners to follow in monetizing their API platforms. Provide relevant, seamless advertising embedded into each API stream. When it comes to content APIs this is easy to envision, but with other forms of media and resources it will get much more complicated.
</p>
<p>
     Twitter, was made successful by its API community, with all its web and mobile properties consuming its API, and the service itself resembles many APIs in how it works. Perhaps the work Twitter is doing can be used as a model for building out an <a title="advertising network dedicated to APIs" href="/2011/09/28/advertising-network-dedicated-to-apis-and-developers/">advertising network dedicated to APIs</a>, baking in monetization into each and every API call, before it reaches the web or mobile application layers.

        <span class="post-date">28 Nov 2011</span>
        <p><a title="Defag Conf" href="http://defragcon.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/events/defrag-2011/defrag-2011.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>"Are API service providers relevant?  Will they remain relevant?"</p>
<p>Thats the question asked by Ben Kepes at this years <a title="Defag Conf" href="http://defragcon.com/">Defrag Conference</a>, while moderating a panel with Apigee's Sam Ramji and Mashery's Neil Mansilla.</p>
<p>It was a bold question to ask, perhaps, in front of an audience comprised of people from 3Scale, Apigee, Mashery and Alcatel Lucent -- all API service providers.  And Sam's response was to dismiss Ben's question was &ldquo;stupid&rdquo;, steering the conversation elsewhere.</p>
<p>Sam seemed to interpret Ben&rsquo;s question as an affront -- not just to Apigee but arguably to all the API providers in the room.  But in light of Sam's own arguments about the importance of thinking about apps as intermediaries, I thought Ben's question was particularly interesting.  After all, many of these API services providers do just that -- act as intermediaries.</p>
<p>On the surface Ben&rsquo;s question may have seemed to be picking a fight with Sam, but I think he meant it, and was seriously asking it of the industry, and I feel it is an important question. I personally think API service providers have a role to play, and can stay relevant if...if they do not impose themselves as intermediaries, but I would love to hear what others think.</p>
<p>I believe doing business in the API space, centers around providing clear value to your customers, without getting in their way.  In the words of Jeff Lawson of Twilio, "Get out of the way of the Doers!".  This philosophy applies to API service providers as well.</p>
<p>To stay relevant, the API service providers have to practice what they preach to their customers; be service oriented, decouple and allow their customers to be doers via a self-service, clearly priced, secure platform while providing added value in the form of premium services.  Without this practice, API services providers just reflect the old way of building and selling software, not the new API driven world.</p>
<p>Beyond the <a title="3Scale" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/serviceproviders/3scale.php">3Scale</a>, <a title="Apigee" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/serviceproviders/apigee.php">Apigee</a> and <a title="Mashery" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/serviceproviders/mashery.php">Mashery</a> API service providers of the world, we also need to acknowledge there is a continued need for open-source tools and platforms that can deliver the services that businesses need for their APIs.   These tools allow for a vibrant ecosystem of service providers to support these tools and platforms just like with other open-source software communities.  Maybe the existing API service providers can even contribute to these projects and champion the cause?</p>
<p>I guess my point is, that things change quickly,  you have to have to be agile, flexible and deliver clear value to stay relevant.  This applies to any business, API service providers are not exempt.  In today's fast paced, technology driven business climate, I don't think any business leader can dismiss this question, and I think everyone should ask it often...how can I remain relevant?  Great question Ben!</p>

     <strong><em>Swagger is a specification and complete framework implementation for describing, producing, consuming, and visualizing RESTful web services.</em></strong>
</blockquote>
<p>
     The goal of Swagger is to enable client and documentation systems to update at the same pace as the server. The documentation of methods, parameters and models are tightly integrated into the server code, allowing APIs to always stay in sync.
</p>
<p>
     Swagger was born out of initiatives from <a title="Wordnik" href="http://www.wordnik.com/">Wordnik</a>, developed for Wordnik’s own use during the development of <a title="developer.wordnik.com" href="http://developer.wordnik.com/">developer.wordnik.com</a>. Swagger development began in early 2010 and the framework being released is used by Wordnik’s APIs, which power both internal and external API clients.
</p>
<p>
     Swagger provides a declarative resource specification, allowing users to understand and consume services without knowledge of server implementation, enabling both developers and non-developers to interact with the API, providing clear insight into how the API responds to parameters and options.
</p>
<p>
     I’m familiarizing myself with the specification more and playing with the various tools they provide:
</p>
<p>
     <a title="Swagger" href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/05/the-swagger-spec-is-reborn-as-open-api-definition-format-oadf-after-being-put-into-open-api-initiative-oai/"></a><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/swagger/Swagger-Screenshot-1.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" />

<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>Swagger UI</strong> - A dependency-free collection of HTML, Javascript, and CSS assets that dynamically generate beautiful documentation from a Swagger-compliant API
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Swagger Core</strong> - Defines Java annotations and required logic to generate a Swagger server or client.
     </li>

     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     I understand that Swagger is not the one specification to rule all APIs, and it won’t make all religious API fanatics happy. But I want to start somewhere. I see three main benefits for API owners coming from adopting Swagger:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Automated, consistent generation of clean, beautiful, interactive API documentation
     </li>
     <li>Generation of client code and SDK in multiple languages
     </li>
     <li>Feeding into an industry wide API discovery language that both developers and non-developers can use
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     I believe strongly that consistent documentation and code samples ensure an API will get used, but as the number of APIs grows, a system like <a title="Google API Discovery Service" href="/2011/05/21/google-apis-discovery-service/">Google API Discovery Service</a>, will be essential for API adoption across industries and around the globe. I’m hoping to learn more about Swagger, and see if it can help deliver on this vision.

</p>
<p>
     <a title="Last March Google support OAuth 2.0" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2011/03/14/google-api-access-with-oauth-2-0/">Last March Google started support OAuth 2.0 for all of their APIs</a>, and has been pushing all developers to switch to using OAuth 2.0 in all applications.
</p>
<p>
     Today they announced the <a href="https://code.google.com/oauthplayground/" target="_blank">OAuth 2.0 Playground</a> which allows developers to experiment with APIs using the OAuth 2.0 protocol, and understand how the protocol functions and will make your life easier.
</p>
<p>
     The OAuth 2.0 Playground enables developers to walk through each step of the OAuth 2.0 flow for server-side web applications:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Authorizing API scopes
     </li>
     <li>Exchanging authorization tokens
     </li>
     <li>Refreshing access tokens
     </li>
     <li>Sending authorized requests to API endpoints
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     At each step, the Playground displays the full HTTP requests and responses for each API.
</p>
<p>
     Google’s endorsement of OAuth 2.0 was very important for the standard and the API industry as a whole. APIs need a secure and standard way for users to authenticate and allow access to their resources when using web and mobile apps.  With Twitter, Google, Facebook and other heavyhitters on board, OAuth is here to stay.
</p>
<p>
     OAuth has traditionally been difficult for some developers to implement, which has gotten easier with 2.0. But we all have to work to help developers understand its value and how to implement--tools like <a href="https://code.google.com/oauthplayground/" target="_blank">Google OAuth 2.0 Playground</a> will go a long way in helping developers understand the standard, ensuring that users app experience is pleasant and secure, and APIs are seen as a secure and efficient way to builld applications around.

<p><a title="Pioneer Corporation" href="http://pioneer.jp/">Pioneer Corporation</a> just announced the availability of Zypr&trade;, a new voice-powered API that  provides a conversational, voice-control command API allowing developers to integrate <a title="Siri" href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/siri.html">Siri</a> like functionality into their own applications.</p>
<p>The <a title="Zypr API" href="http://www.zypr.net/">Zypr API</a> provides a single RESTful API for developers to access voice UI, maps and routing, local search, social networking, music and radio, contacts, calendars and weather from multiple service providers, including:  Facebook, Twitter, Google, Yelp, AccuWeather, INRIX real-time and predictive traffic information, Slacker Radio, Tuner2 Radio, Wcities, xAd and VoiceBox.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve covered <a title="unified and aggregate APIs" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2011/09/13/unified-data-apis-for-geo,-weather-and-beyond/">unified and aggregate APIs</a> in the past, where within maturing industries like social and cloud computing, service providers are stepping up with a single API to work with multiple providers.  Zypr is similar in that it offers a single API for multiple providers, but uses voice as the mechanism for search.   Zypyr&rsquo;s goal is to normalize, stable and voice-enhanced method for accessing a wide array of constantly changing APIs, Zypr can reduces the impact of service-specific API changes.</p>
<p><a title="Zypr API" href="http://www.zypr.net/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Zypr/Zypr-Server-Architecture.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Pioneer created Zypr so that any type of developer or device maker on any platform can easily offer compelling new services to enhance their own technology and brand equity,&rdquo; said Susumu Kotani, the president of Pioneer Corporation. &ldquo;We have also changed the rules by allowing developers and device makers alike the opportunity to share in revenue when they deploy Zypr.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition to providing revenue sharing opportunities, the Zypr API is available at no chrage to developers.  You can access documentation, code, sample application and other developer tools at <a title="Zyprnet" href="http://www.zypr.net/">www.zypr.net</a>.</p>
<p>With a simple, but powerful RESTful API and the buzz around <a title="Siri" href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/siri.html">Siri</a>, Apples new voice tasking system , the Zypr API is sure to be a hit.  If Pioneer Corporation can successfully evangelize the Zypr API and get it into the hands of hackers and developer globally, it could easy become the <a title="Twilio" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/apis/twilio.php">Twilio</a> of voice tasking.</p>

        <p><a title="Atmosphere API Management" href="http://atmos.phe.re/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-service-providers/soa/atmosphere-logo-1.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I first reported on service oriented architecture (SOA) pioneer <a href="http://www.soa.com/">SOA Software&rsquo;s</a> entry into the API management arena <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2011/06/17/atmosphere-a-new-api-management-portal/">back in June</a>, today at the Cloud Computing Expo in Santa Clara, CA they are announcing the beta release of their enterprise API management solution called <a title="Atmosphere API Management" href="http://atmos.phe.re/">Atmos.phe.re</a>.</p>
<p>SOA has taken their enterprise API management solution, and bundled it with many of the features we are growing accustomed to within open API ecosystems, and deployed as a new solution with a focus on community.</p>
<p>The new platform intends to bring together API owners and application developers into a community, providing a central place where an ecosystem can grow around each of your APIs, whether its a private or public initiative.</p>
<p>Atmosphere is taking the social aspects of popular, open API ecosystems, and are applying these concepts to the enterprise, providing not only a place where API owners and developers can come together, but it also invites business, marketing and creative folks to get involved--creating a truly collaborative, enterprise environment around any API initiative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enterprises now have a choice in how they provide APIs. They can use Atmosphere Cloud to manage their developer community, and process messages on-premise.&rdquo; said Alistair Farquharson, Chief Technology Officer, SOA Software. &ldquo;This provides companies with complete control over their API traffic without requiring a large internal infrastructure to support their developer community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This evolution of the API ecosystem makes sense, by providing the same set of social features available within both public and private communities as well as on-premise or cloud deployments it provides a very agile, business development environment for enterprises to take advantage of.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t had a full test drive of SOA&rsquo;s new platform, but from what I&rsquo;ve seen it posseses all the characteristics I&rsquo;ve seen with other API management providers, but also brings to the table important social and community layers that I think are essential to the future of APIs.</p>

<p>I came across this on the White House blog today, &ldquo;<a title="Request for Information on Public Access to Digital Data and Scientific Publications" href="http://m.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/11/07/request-information-public-access-digital-data-and-scientific-publications">Request for Information on Public Access to Digital Data and Scientific Publications</a>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The <a title="America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010" href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.5116:">America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010</a>, signed by President Obama earlier this year, calls upon OSTP to coordinate with agencies to develop policies that assure widespread public access to and long-term stewardship of the results of federally funded unclassified research. Towards that goal, OSTP last week released two Requests for Information (RFI) soliciting public input on long term preservation of and public access to the results of federally funded research, including digital data and peer-reviewed scholarly publications.</p>
<p>The White House is now seeking additional insight from "non-Federal stakeholders, including the public, universities, nonprofit and for-profit publishers, libraries, federally funded and non-federally funded research scientists, and other organizations and institutions with an interest in long- term stewardship and improved public access to the results of federally funded research".  Specifically the Working Group seeks further public comment on the questions listed below:</p>
<ol class="mainlist">
<li>What specific Federal policies would encourage public access to and the preservation of broadly valuable digital data resulting from federally funded scientific research, to grow the U.S. economy and improve the productivity of the American scientific enterprise?</li>
<li>What specific steps can be taken to protect the intellectual property interests of publishers, scientists, Federal agencies, and other stakeholders, with respect to any existing or proposed policies for encouraging public access to and preservation of digital data resulting from federally funded scientific research?</li>
<li>How could Federal agencies take into account inherent differences between scientific disciplines and different types of digital data when developing policies on the management of data?</li>
<li>How could agency policies consider differences in the relative costs and benefits of long-term stewardship and dissemination of different types of data resulting from federally funded research?</li>
<li>How can stakeholders (e.g., research communities, universities, research institutions, libraries, scientific publishers) best contribute to the implementation of data management plans?</li>
<li>How could funding mechanisms be improved to better address the real costs of preserving and making digital data accessible?</li>
<li>What approaches could agencies take to measure, verify, and improve compliance with Federal data stewardship and access policies for scientific research?</li>
How can the burden of compliance and verification be minimized?
<li>What additional steps could agencies take to stimulate innovative use of publicly accessible research data in new and existing markets and industries to create jobs and grow the economy?</li>
<li>What mechanisms could be developed to assure that those who produced the data are given appropriate attribution and credit when secondary results are reported?</li>
Standards for Interoperability, Re-Use and Re-Purposing
<li>What digital data standards would enable interoperability, reuse, and repurposing of digital scientific data?</li>
For example, MIAME (minimum information about a microarray experiment; see Brazma et al., 2001, Nature Genetics 29, 371) is an example of a community-driven data standards effort.
<li>What are other examples of standards development processes that were successful in producing effective standards and what characteristics of the process made these efforts successful?</li>
<li>How could Federal agencies promote effective coordination on digital data standards with other nations and international communities?</li>
<li>What policies, practices, and standards are needed to support linking between publications and associated data?</li>
</ol>
<p>As I was reading through these questions I can&rsquo;t help think about the <a title="API Service Provider Platforms" href="http://apievangelist.com/serviceproviders/">API service provider platforms</a> that I review on a regular basis, and how APIs can be employed for opening up this research.   Responses to this RFI will be accepted through January 12, 2012.  I&rsquo;m going to spend the holidays thinking about how APIs can best facilitate public access to this federally funded research, and I wanted to turn it into more discussion here on <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> and see what others have to say.</p>
<p>As I answer each question I&rsquo;m going to try and publish as separate blog post, feel free share your comments as I work through.</p>

<p>I wrote a piece yesterday on the FCC Open Commission recent proposal to require that television stations make their &ldquo;public inspection file&rdquo; available online called, &ldquo;<a title="Opening Up Information is Not Enough, It Needs to Be Open" href="/2011/11/02/opening-up-information-is-not-enough,-its-needs-to-be-accessible/">Opening Up Information is Not Enough, Its Needs to be Accessible</a>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Since writing I&rsquo;ve been thinking about how APIs can become a self-service tool in government regulation.  Here are my rough thoughts on the subject, completely un-polished.</p>
<p>When a government agency mandates that an industry provide some information, along with that request should come with a mandate on a standard for the data format and making it accessible via an API. &nbsp;Of course this could come with some sort of security layer, so not everything is immediately open, but the more open the better.</p>
<p>Along with the regulatory mandate the requesting agency could have some sort of aggregate tool for pull the requested data from each entities API, making available internally and externally as needed for other agencies, researchers or the general public.</p>
<p>This type of self-service, API driven, regulatory framework could force businesses and organizations within an industry to comply with necessary information requirements, reduce the overhead for the governing body to collect and organize the data, while also opening up the data, to allow the public and other industry groups to police and make sure companies are complying.</p>
<p>Seems like it could make the overall process around industry regulation more efficient, while putting the responsibility for policing on the public and other public interest groups, reducing the need for government enforcement that can often be bought.</p>

     According to PCMag.com, <a title="Verizon will publish an API that could allow consumers to turbocharge the network bandwidth" href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2395728,00.asp?kc=PCRSS05039TX1K0000762#fbid=r4tz9kBNC_8">Verizon will publish an API that could allow consumers to "turbocharge" the network bandwidth</a> on their smartphone, for a small fee.
</p>
<p>
     Developers could give users the option to pay for the extra bandwidth using a separate micro-transaction API, that Verizon Wireless is developing and hopes to have in place by the end of 2012.
</p>
<p>
     I understand that wireless networks are often congested. But isn’t allowing someone to pay money and circumvent that congestion, creating two separate Internets? A faster one for those that can afford it and a slower one for those that cannot?
</p>
<p>
     Would certain companies be able to offer users “turbocharge credits” when using their apps? So the Internet was faster, only when using the apps that could afford to buy its users attention.
</p>
<p>
     I am pleased to see <a title="Verizon Wireless" href="http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/index.html">Verizon Wireless</a> working on network optimization tools, but is this where we need to monetize the network? Seems like you could make the Internet fast for everyone and charge for other premium services.  You know, really innovate.

<p>
     <a title="Tru.ly" href="https://tru.ly">Tru.ly</a> just launched an <a title="Tru.ly" href="https://tru.ly">age verification API</a> that authenticates the age of an online user based by cross-referencing user-submitted personal information with data points from Tru.ly verification partners.
</p>
<p>
     Verification is done by matching user-submitted information with that in a national database of government and public data. In order to become verified, specific pieces of information must match. Tru.ly also uses a proprietary technology to flag users who may be trying to game the system.
</p>
<p>
     Using Tru.ly, websites with restricted content such as movies, alcohol and video games can programmatically verify its user’s ages, going beyond using just asking for a birth date.
</p>
<p>
     The API was developed to confirm an age while also promoting the guidelines set forth in the <a href="http://www.coppa.org/coppa">Children Online Privacy Protection Act</a> (COPPA), specifically section 1302-9, which defines verifiable parental consent as any reasonable effort, so as to ensure that the parent is aware of the website’s personal information collection, use, and disclosure practices.

     <em>"If the FCC follows its usual practice of having filers submit PDFs (many of which are often scanned from printed documents), this data may be nearly useless to the small number of researchers who would really benefit from having a large set of public inspection files available online."</em>
</blockquote>
<p>
     This is a common misconception among government agencies, that just publishing a PDF to a web is making the information “accessible”. Sure anyone can download this information, but it makes extracting meaning and value across many television stations so much work, pretty much nobody will do it. Researchers need this type of true access to compare data across stations, and identify larger trends and patterns that exist.
</p>
<p>
     This approach to information disclosure is does not meet the transparency guidelines set by the Obama Administration to implement Open Government by requiring agencies to:
</p>
<blockquote>
     <em>"publish information online in an open format that can be retrieved, downloaded, indexed, and searched by commonly used web search applications. An open format is one that is platform independent, machine readable, and made available to the public without restrictions that would impede the re-use of that information."</em>
</blockquote>
<p>
     <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/fcc/television-icon.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" />
</p>
<p>
     Transparency offers an alternative to regulation that goes all the way back to President Clinton’s Executive Order 12866 (1993) which states "Each agency shall identify and assess available alternatives to direct regulation, including … providing information upon which choices can be made by the public."
</p>
<p>
     Federal agencies requiring business to collect and make information to the public, without also requiring that they submit it in a machine-readable format, creates more bureaucratic, useless government. There needs to be more education of officials who oversee transparency initiatives and make sure that truly understand what is needed to make data open and accessible.

</p>
<p>
     I’m spending some time getting to know the <a href="http://topsylabs.com/products/api/">Topsy Labs API</a> today. <a title="Topsy Labs" href="http://topsylabs.com/">Topsy Labs</a> offers access to its proprietary metrics, social content, and influence data via a RESTful API. As I was reviewing, their API access and rates limit page caught my eye.
</p>
<p>
     Here is their intro paragraph:
</p>
<blockquote>
     <em>We provide limited, free API access so that you can quickly and easily test the service and confirm the value it will provide to your business. We have three different tiers to match your implementation.</em>
</blockquote>
<p>
     What is interesting, is they not only provide a freemium level they have one better, a free and open tier, provider two introductory API access levels:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>No API Key</strong> - 3,000 queries/day – API calls that do not carry an API key will be limited to 3,000 queries/day.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Free API Key</strong> - 7,000 queries/day – API calls that carry an API key will increase their limit to 7,000 queries/day.
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     Then they provide a quick link: <a title="Register to get Started" href="http://manage.topsy.com/app/create">Register to get started</a>
</p>
<p>
     What an inviting, frictionless way to getting started with an API. For those wanting more, they also provide information about obtaining a commercial API key:
</p>
<p class="c2">
     <em>Once you confirm the value of our API, you can get a commercial license, giving you more volume to accommodate your business needs, exposes other valuable API calls, provides you with technical support, and ensures you are guaranteed specific service level parameters.</em>
</p>
<p>
     The Topsy Labs approach provides an interesting model for some API owners to provide limited and free API access to their APIs, enabling developers to quickly and easily test the service and confirm the value before integrating.

        <span class="post-date">01 Nov 2011</span>
        <p>
     <a title="API Industries" href="/industries/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Tag-Cloud-Industries.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a>
</p>
<p>
     I try to pay attention to how APIs are transforming as many <a title="API Industries" href="/industries/">industries</a> as I can. I usually carve out at least an hour each day, to evalute a specific industry, the APIs in it, trying to understand what each API delivers and how the industry works, while also identifying where the opportunities lie.
</p>
<p>
     Right now I am looking at two areas or industries of APIs:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <a title="Cloud Storage APIs" href="http://developer.mimeo.com/projects/project_detail.php?ID=36">Cloud Storage APIs</a>
     </li>
     <li>
          <a title="Image and Photo APIs" href="http://developer.mimeo.com/projects/project_detail.php?ID=35">Image and Photo APIs</a>
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     Even though I want to be familiar with both these areas, and will write stories on everything I find, my primary goal is to provide the <a title="Mimeo" href="http://www.mimeo.com">Mimeo</a> development team with as much information, about the best document and photo storage APIs available for integrating into our systems.
</p>
<p>
     There are <a title="46 storage APIs" href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory/1?apicat=Storage">46 storage APIs</a> and <a title="120 photo APIs" href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory/1?apicat=Photos">120 photo APIs</a> in the <a title="ProgrammableWeb Directory" href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory/">ProgrammableWeb directory</a>. I went through all of the APIs and pulled out the APIs that were RESTful, had potential for print integration and were popular or were a stable, quality service. I found 19 storage APIs and 12 photo APIs I felt were a fit.
</p>
<p>
     After looking at 166 APIs and pulling out 31 APIs that offered value, you walk away with a pretty good sense of what makes a good API deployment. Anyone who is launching an API should spend time looking at at least 50 other APIs before building their own. API areas should simple, straight the point and employ the <a title="essential API building blocks" href="/2011/03/07/api-area-common-building-blocks/">essential API building blocks</a>.
</p>
<p>
     I’d say the biggest problem with each API is: <em><strong>What the hell does this API do?</strong></em>
</p>
<p>
     Every API should put a really simple explanation of what it does in 150 words or less. Pretend you just have one tweet to use. What value does your API deliver? Make it count!
</p>
<p>
     There are so many other things I consider when evaluating an API, these are a few of my immediate concerns while trying to quickly assess a lot of APIs. Think about it, I’m only dealing with 166 APIs out of 4000 APIs. What will this look like when we have 100K + APIs?

</p>
<p>
     The <a title="Twilio Voice API" href="http://www.twilio.com/api/voice">Twilio Voice API</a> is now available in the UK, allowing developers to launch local phone numbers in the country.  Along with the release Twilio has announced the opening of their first international office based in East London.
</p>
<p>
     The UK launch is the first to go live of five countries currently in Beta including France, Poland, Austria, Denmark and Portugal with several more countries on the way.
</p>
<p>
     Twilio's APIs have proven a favorite of developers, and fast becoming an essential cloud computing service for applications.
</p>
<p>
     The move into Europe will only grow their developer base and the number of applications using the cloud telephony API. Something that traditional telcos should take notice of.

        <span class="post-date">26 Oct 2011</span>
        <p>Last week <a title="Mashery" href="http://mashery.com/">Mashery</a> rolled out a new on-premise version of their API management proxy. &nbsp;A solution meant to address a common concern of IT and API owners, that when using Mashery, all of their data and resources run through the Mashery proxy in the cloud. &nbsp;This concern can be a show stopper for many companies.</p>
<p>Until this last week, Mashery had four API management solutions that all ran in the cloud.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-service-providers/mashery/Mashery-Products-1.png" alt="" width="500" align="center" /></p>
<p>Now Mashery has separated the proxy portion of their traffic manager into two offerings, one for the cloud and one for on-premise.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-service-providers/mashery/API-Traffic-Cloud-Local.png" alt="" width="500" align="center" /></p>
<p>Mashery has bundled the new Mashery Cloud and Mashery Local with their existing API Traffic, API Analytics &amp; Reporting and API Portal and are calling it, the Mashery API control center.  Using the API control center you now have the flexibility to deploy on-premise or in the cloud as needed.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-service-providers/mashery/mashery-api-control-center.jpg" alt="" width="500" align="center" /></p>
<p>Of course the full benefits of the Mashery API Distribution Network which includes scalability, redundancy, PCI compliance, access to global partner network and SLA&rsquo;s are only available for APIs deployed using Mashery Cloud.</p>
<p>Even though the&nbsp;<a title="Mashery API Control Center" href="http://mashery.com/solution/controlcenter/">Mashery API Control Center</a> is meant to provide flexibility of deployment for API owners, the move is clearly a direct shot at their primary competitor Apigee, who have had an on-premise solution for some time, but <a title="Mashery" href="/serviceproviders/mashery.php">Mashery</a> claims their control center provides much more flexibility than "their competitors".</p>

        <span class="post-date">25 Oct 2011</span>
        <p><a title="Vordel" href="http://www.vordel.com/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-service-providers/vordel/Vordel-API-Management.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I have done a lot of research lately on the <a title="API Service Provider" href="/serviceproviders/">API service provider</a> landscape.  My goal is to understand who provides API delivery and management services, what they offer and help API owners understand the differences.</p>
<p>I wrote a <a title="roundup of 11 of the API service providers" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/10/19/api-service-provider-roundup/">roundup of 11 of the API service providers on ProgrammableWeb</a> last week.  I feel like I have a pretty good grasp of all the providers, but of course a new one came out of the woodwork.</p>
<p>It wasn't a new API service provider like <a href="/serviceproviders/mashape.php">Mashape</a> or <a href="/2011/10/07/easy-api-development-with-apiary-io/">Apiary.io</a>, it is a veteran player in the space, <a title="Vordel" href="http://www.vordel.com/">Vordel</a>.  Vordel has been around for almost 10 years and I would consider them part of the old guard of service oriented architecture (SOA) and web services providers, that existed before web APIs were cool.</p>
<p>Vordel provides a range of products we recognize with enterprise API deployments including <a title="API Gateways" href="http://www.vordel.com/solutions/api_gateway2.html">API Gateways</a>, <a title="XML Firewalls" href="http://www.vordel.com/solutions/xml_firewall.html">XML firewalls</a> and <a title="XML accelerators" href="http://www.vordel.com/solutions/xml_accelerator.html">accelerators</a>.  Vordel specializes in the legacy system connectors that are needed to bring existing enterprise systems into the new web API game.</p>
<p>The Vordel API Gateway compares to what I've seen from <a title="Layer7" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2011/06/17/layer-7-technologies-launches-new-api-portal/">Layer7</a> and <a title="SOA Software" href="/2011/06/17/atmosphere-a-new-api-management-portal/">SOA Software</a>, with the following key features:</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-service-providers/vordel/Vordel-API-Gateway.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Protocol translation for REST and SOAP</li>
<li>Versioning and lifecycle management</li>
<li>Caching of frequently used calls</li>
<li>Monitor, log and audit usage</li>
<li>Secure API from threats</li>
<li>Service level agreements (SLA)</li>
</ul>
<p>Vordel has an impressive client list including the FBI, Coast Guard and Dunn &amp; Bradstreet, and delivers some progressive integrations, like a deployment of their API gateway for <a title="Blackhawk Network" href="http://www.blackhawknetwork.com/">Blackhawk Network</a>, which extends REST services to their business partners like iTunes and Facebook.</p>
<p>I see all the hardened enterprise services I've seen with existing providers, I think why they may have missed my radar is they lack the open API building blocks like developer portals, app showcases, forums and the self-service partner systems I tend to track on.</p>
<p>Vordel is new to me, it will take some more time to get to know their products and team like I have with existing API management service providers.  As I learn more about Vordel I will share more information about the company, the services they offer, and what makes them stand out from existing landscape of <a title="API Service Providers" href="/serviceproviders/">API service providers</a>.</p>

     One of the ways I develop content for this site is by talking through my day to day experiences as an API Evangelist. I feel that talking through what I’m learning in real-time, is the best way to make it stick, while also sharing with the public. There is a lot of value that comes out of my daily learning, and it would be wrong to not share this.
</p>
<p>
     I had someone approach me on LinkedIn today and ask:
</p>
<blockquote>
     <em>I'm trying to convince my colleagues and managers on the importance of having internal API, not just as a prologue to public API, but also as a way to have cleaner, better-understood interfaces internally for our developers. Do you have any thoughts or tips on the subject?</em>
</blockquote>
<p>
     <a title="Internal evangelism" href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/09/29/api-evangelism-is-equal-parts-internal,-partner-and-public-outreach/">Internal evangelism</a> is a big part of my role, and I know its something that other API advocates face as they are trying to sell the concept of APIs to decision makers within their company. Testing the water with APIs internally is the best way to get started, and learn what goes into planning, deploying and managing an API.
</p>
<p>
     When trying to sell your bosses on APIs for internal use, I would start with:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>Decoupling</strong> - Deploying resources and your data within your company as individual RESTful resources decouple them, allowing them to consumed and managed independently. This kind of of decoupling of data and resources enable more agile scaling, migration and integration into a wide range of organizations and applications across your company. Consider how <a title="consider how API enabled Netflix to move from the data center to the cloud" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/06/20/apis-power-netflix%E2%80%99s-move-to-cloud-enabling-world-domination/">APIs have enabled Netflix to migrate from the data-center to the cloud</a>, with unprecedented growth simultaneously, and also enabling them to grow globally.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Product Management</strong> - Allocating your companies data and resources as independent RESTful APIs will simplify your product management allowing them to be defined, launched, deployed and even killed off independently of each other. This type of allocation will allow very granular ownership of each product, allowing product managers to own specific APIs or groups of API products, and scale product ownership with new managers as needed.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Organization Interoperability</strong> - APIs enable much more flexible collaboration between different departments that may be geographically or organizational distant. With a growing virtual workforce, this type of interoperability will be key to companies being able to staff up and meet the demands of their growing businesses.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Multi-Use</strong> - APIs will enable your companies resources and data to be used across multiple implementations from internal applications, websites, mobile and tablet devices without building out separate systems.
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/blueprints.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
</p>
<p>
     That is where I’d start with selling colleagues and managers on the importance of having internal APIs. APIs can introduce flexibility and agility not only into your IT and development operations, but also introduce a <a title="RESTful Business Architecture" href="/2011/04/09/restful-business-architecture/">RESTful business architecture</a> into your company.
</p>
<p>
     In addition to the benefits APIs will introduce internally, all of this will set the stage for improved business development with your partners and your company will be primed, if and when you are ready to open up your APIs to the public.
</p>
<p>
     <strong>UPDATE:</strong>
</p>
<p>
     The person who contacted me on LinkedIn got back to me with this:
</p>
<blockquote>
     <em>Thank you. I showed your post to one of the managers here and it actually made him changed his mind. The next step it to persuade we need to use vendors such as 3Scale, Apigee or Mashery instead of building it all by ourselves. </em>

        <span class="post-date">25 Oct 2011</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.data.gov/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/data-gov/Datagov.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.data.gov/" target="_blank">Data.gov</a> for me is like being a kid in a candy store.  My experience with data goes back to High School when I got my first programming job right out of Mr. Smiths computer class.  I built Cobol database for use by school districts in the State of Oregon, jump-starting my career as a programmer.  Ever since I&rsquo;ve had an obsession with data, and specifically with government data, and <a title="trying to make sense how government operates" href="http://oregonbudget.laneworks.net/" target="_blank">trying to make sense of how our government operates</a>.</p>
<p>I have been playing with various data-sets at Data.gov since they launched, but today I finally spent some time evaluating their approach to delivering the Data.gov ecosystem.  It is a pretty robust approach to opening up our government, agency by agency.</p>
<p>The Data.gov sites centers around data-sets available by agency, category and topics, with the ability to view as raw data, files &amp; documents, charts, maps, calendars, filtered views and interactive data-sets.  Data is made available in a wide range of formats including .csv, .xls, .xml, .rdf, .kml and .shp files when each format applies.</p>
<p>Data.gov is not just for developers, many of the data-sets are available in interactive formats, as well as a wide variety of applications, making the data accessible and usable by anyone.   A couple examples of applications include <a title="product recalls" href="http://explore.data.gov/Wholesale-and-Retail-Trade/All-Product-Recalls/ezdk-xtg7" target="_blank">product recalls</a>, <a title="travel warnings" href="http://explore.data.gov/National-Security-and-Veterans-Affairs/Travel-Warnings/hkvp-3krc" target="_blank">travel warnings</a> and <a title="hospital compare" href="http://explore.data.gov/Social-Insurance-and-Human-Services/Hospital-Compare/g4a8-s9zu" target="_blank">hospital compare</a>.  What really makes these apps valuable, is the data-sets are usually available alongside, so if you want to dive in deeper and use the data in other ways, you can.</p>
<p>Since Data.gov is a the top level site for the open data initiative, there is an obvious need to break it down into some smaller communities.  These communities include:</p>
<p><a title="Energy" href="http://www.data.gov/communities/energy" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/data-gov/Energy-Data-Gov.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="Energy" href="http://www.data.gov/communities/energy" target="_blank">Energy</a></strong> - Data, tools, apps, challenges, resources, blog, forums centered around energy data, meant to facilitate public discussion of and awareness on our Nation&rsquo;s energy activity.</li>
<li><strong><a title="Health" href="http://www.data.gov/communities/health" target="_blank">Health</a></strong> - Data, apps, blog and forum centered around health and health care, intended to help the public make better informed decisions about their health.</li>

</ul>
<p>The energy, health and law communities at Data.gov represent different areas of our government.  I&rsquo;m assuming they will add education, with data from <a title="data.ed.gov" href="http://data.ed.gov/" target="_blank">data.ed.gov</a> as a community in the near future.  There is a &ldquo;learn&rdquo; section off the home page of Data.gov, but it doesn&rsquo;t have the community building tools the other areas have, with just links to external sites and resources.</p>
<p>There are two other communities, that are more focused on technology, as opposed to areas of our government:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="Open Data" href="http://www.data.gov/communities/opendata" target="_blank">Open Data</a></strong> - Blog, forum and Twitter stream dedicate to the concept of open data and the government, and the community being built around it.</li>
<li><strong><a title="Semantic Web" href="http://www.data.gov/communities/semantic" target="_blank">Semantic Web</a></strong> - Apps, blog and forums dedicated to evolving linked data amongst the Data.gov open data initiative. </li>
</ul>
<p><a title="Environmental and Compliance Data" href="http://explore.data.gov/Geography-and-Environment/EPA-Enforcement-and-Compliance-History-Online-ECHO/c8kh-iqih" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/data-gov/Environmental-Compliance-Data.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>There is one more community called <strong>"<a title="Restore the Gulf" href="http://www.data.gov/restorethegulf" target="_blank">Restore the Gulf</a>"</strong>, which is focused around the specific issue that we are facing down in the Gulf of Mexico.  Hopefully it is the start of a third type of Data.gov community that can address various issues our country faces, pulling together data, tools and resources to build a community to address the issue.</p>
<p>I can see the work that went into building community around the areas of government, technology and issues, but as its coming together it still looks a little disjointed, with learning not really coming together as an actual education community and &ldquo;developers corner&rdquo; off the home page ending up linking to the open data community, creating a little redundancy.  Its a great effort to bring together community, with just a little more structure, and presence, the site can really deliver on this vision.</p>
<p>There are other sections tying together the site like an <a title="about page" href="http://www.data.gov/about" target="_blank">about page</a>, <a title="frequently asked questions" href="http://www.data.gov/faq">frequently asked questions</a> and <a title="contact information" href="http://www.data.gov/contact">contact information</a>.   Data.gov also addresses <a title="data policy" href="http://www.data.gov/datapolicy">data</a> and <a title="privacy policy" href="http://www.data.gov/privacypolicy">privacy</a> with policy pages and even speaks to <a title="accessibility" href="http://www.data.gov/accessibility">accessibility</a> which is something you don&rsquo;t see in many data and API ecosystems.  There are also <a title="tutorials" href="http://www.data.gov/developers#TB_inline?height=200&amp;width=400&amp;inlineId=tb_external">tutorials</a>, <a title="videos" href="http://www.data.gov/developers#TB_inline?height=200&amp;width=400&amp;inlineId=tb_external">videos</a> and a <a title="whats new" href="http://www.data.gov/whatsnew">whats new</a> section providing other resources to get everyone understanding the vision, how to use the resources available, as well as keeping users engaged with any new announcements.</p>
<p>The site does a great job showcasing applications and important data-sets with a gallery, also using feature displays on the home page and within community pages.  These are great for exposing some of the great data-sets and applications available within the site.  This kind of discovery is very important to introducing users to whats available without feeling overwhelmed by the large amounts of data available.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/data-gov/Featured-Tool.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>Overall Data.gov does an amazing job of delivering huge amounts of quality government data-sets in very usable formats, making it interactive and providing applications for working with the data.  There are also APIs available for accessing the data, which is extremely important in empowering developers to build web an mobile applications, crunch data and build visualizations that shedding light into how our government operates, increasing participation.  The Data.gov platform and APIs are delivered by a service provider called <a title="Socrata" href="http://www.socrata.com/" target="_blank">Socrata</a>.  I will provide more coverage of the APIs and Socrata after I work with them a little more, and gain a better understanding of how they work.</p>
<p>A lot of effort has been put into building community around the Data.gov initiative, but as I mentioned in my last post about <a title="Bringing Awareness to Data.Gov with Grassroots Evangelism" href="/2011/10/24/bringing-awareness-to-data-gov-with-grassroots-evangelism/" target="_blank">bringing awareness to Data.gov with grassroots evangelism</a>, I think there is a lot more to do in making sure people everywhere are aware Data.gov exists and do a little more to bring them to the site, by reaching out to the online communities where they already exists, like <a title="Github" href="http://github.com" target="_blank">Github</a>, <a title="Stack Exchange" href="http://stackexchange.com/" target="_blank">Stack Exchange</a> and <a title="Hacker News" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/" target="_blank">Hacker News</a>, participating in their community, listening, joining and taking part in their world.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/data-gov/digital-town-hall.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>There is a lot that can be done online to create awareness around the resources our government is making available, but a robust online presence is not enough.  There needs to be a grassroots effort to bring Data.gov to every small town, engaging the public within each community via schools, libraries and other community gathering places--make them aware of the rich resources our government has exposed and challenge them to come together and help us find the answers that make our government operate more efficiently.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.data.gov/" target="_blank">Data.gov</a> is a an excellent start, next we need to increase our governments presence online and offline, creating the feedback loop that will bring developers, data scientists and our brightest minds together within the communities available at Data.gov and beyond.</p>

        <span class="post-date">24 Oct 2011</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/content-api-monetization.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>As the number of APIs grow, the number of ways in which API owners control and incentivize their developers ecosystems evolves.    <a title="APIs are your business development platform" href="/2010/10/07/biz-dev-2-0/">APIs are your business development 2.0 platform</a>, and it is up to you to tailor your services to incentivize your developers as well as control API usage to meet your business goals.</p>
<p>One emerging way to control API consumption to meet your business goals is through a balance between pricing and <a title="Terms of Service" href="/buildingblocks/terms_of_use__conditions.php">terms of service (TOS)</a>.    By offering branding opportunities to developers that they can deploy alongside the content and resources they consume via your API, you can easily turn your developer community into an extension of your marketing department.</p>
<p>Price breaks can be offered to developers who extend your brand, encouraging them to build a business around your API content and resources as long as it adds value to your brand.  API consumers who opt not to take part in branding, can be charged more, adding value to your company purely as revenue opportunity.</p>
<p><a title="Branding" href="/buildingblocks/branding.php">Branding</a> and pricing controls are a growing way to ensure your API adds value to your company either as revenue or brand syndication, but another way some content and data API providers are finding success, is through a contribution incentive.  Just like brand extension, API contribution gives developers an opportunity to participate deeper and receive price breaks, while also be encouraged to contribute content back to an API, enriching content and add valuable information back to your companies API.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/api-monetization.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>Writeable APIs can be made available allowing developers to contribute user reviews, comments, annotations or even correct and update content that originated from your company. Proper service and key management around your API,  allows you to track which users contribute content back to your system.  As a result of this participation you can offer further price breaks in the form of credits, or even end up paying customers for their content contributions.</p>
<p>Incentivizing and controlling API usage through brand, pricing and contribution may not work for every API, but it offers some interesting opportunities for publishers and API owners to develop new forms of self-service, business development relationships around their API ecosystems.</p>

</p>
<p>
     I just finished a four week roadshow that included three <a title="Startup Weekend" href="http://startupweekend.org/">Startup Weekend</a> EDU events -- one in Seattle, one in San Francisco and one in Washington DC -- as well as two versions of the <a title="Business of APIs Conference" href="http://apiconference.com/">Business of APIs conferences</a> -- one in San Francisco and one in New York City.
</p>
<p>
     It might not seem at first glance that these events had much in common. During the Startup Weekends, business people, teachers and developers rallied to build startups that focused on solving problems in education, while the Business of APIs conferences showcased businesses telling their stories about how opening up data and APIs have transformed them and made them more competitive within their respective industries.
</p>
<p>
     Both events re-enforced for me the importance of both on-the-ground and online evangelism. Both are necessary for ensuring the success of open data and APIs.
</p>
<p>
     At both series of events, I encountered many people who had never heard of <a title="Twilio" href="http://www.twilio.com">Twilio</a> or <a title="Amazon Web Services" href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a> -- two API providers that are leaders in their industries (as well as were sponsors at the events). Both Twilio and Amazon Web Services provide essential cloud resources that can be used by any company and developer, but without the proper awareness and education, these resources go unused. Both companies are active in sponsoring start-up weekends, hackathons, codeathons, meetups and the like, but Twilio does much better at having "boots on the ground" at these events. This presence is one of the things that has made Twilio a developer favorite and, in turn, spawned thousands of apps and many start-ups. But clearly they still have work to do to get their name "out there," particularly at events outside of Silicon Valley.
</p>
<p>
     But having someone on-the-ground isn't always enough. At the Startup Weekend EDU events, for example, there were several people present from the Department of Education and to their credit, they spent the entire time engaging and listening to business people, teachers and developers about what they needed. That was great to see, but at the same time, but there were no materials there about the amazing data and APIs provided by the Department of Education at data.ed.gov and no real encouragement of developers to take advantage of these things.
</p>
<p>
     <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/data-gov/data_gov_open.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
</p>
<p>
     It seems as though we are missing the opportunity to help people become familiar with the various resources that the <a title="Department of Education" href="http://data.ed.gov/">Department of Ed</a> (along with its parent <a title="Data.gov" href="http://explore.data.gov/">data.gov</a> site) offers. As code-athons and other startup-building events continue to spread, it seems a shame to not take better advantage of these tools.
</p>
<p>
     The tech companies do send out their developer advocates and evangelists to "get the word out." Facebook, Google, Twitter, Twilio and the like all have an <a title="army of these sorts of people" href="http://code.google.com/team/">army of these sorts of people</a> to help others work with their data and their APIs.
</p>
<p>
     Now that the government has opened its data, it seems as though the missing piece might be this evangelism element -- taking the open data on the road, from town to town, making the wealth of resources available at <a title="data.gov" href="http://explore.data.gov/">data.gov</a> known and challenging some of our brightest minds to get involved to make our country a better place.

</p>
<p>
     Last spring when I started writing for <a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a>, my first post was "<a title="Everything Site Should Be An API" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/04/06/everything-should-be-an-api-says-fcc/">Everything Should Be an API," Says FCC.</a> The story was about the new FCC web site, that was built entirely on top of RESTful APIs using the Drupal platform.
</p>
<p>
     Since that post, I met the company behind the <a title="FCC Website" href="http://www.fcc.gov/">FCC website</a> redesign, <a title="Seaborne Inc." href="http://seabourneinc.com/">Seabourne Inc.</a>, which builds some pretty innovative solutions using Drupal, employing APIs in everything they do. As part of the FCC.gov website project, Seabourne Inc. built a module for Drupal that leverages the platform for content publishing, powered by APIs.
</p>
<p>
     <a title="Seaborne Inc." href="http://www.fcc.gov/"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/fcc/FCC-Logo.jpg" alt=" width=" width="135" align="right" /></a>
</p>
<p>
     I spoke with Mike Reich, the CEO of Seabourne Inc. about APIs, he is as passionate about APIs as I am, but has identified the best place to start when it comes to opening up the government, is with content APIs instead of just focusing on data APIs.
</p>
<p>
     He’s right. In the rush to open up government data, many of us overlook the huge archives and content generated on a daily basis by our government. Recently, many government agencies are adopting Drupal as a content management platform, and using Seaborne’s Content API for Drupal, any agency or organization can make content openly accessible via an API.
</p>
<p>
     Their Content APIs can instantly make content from an agencies website available for other agencies to access in a self-service way, reducing the resources needed for inter-departmental coordination. In addition to making external coordination more efficient, it can make rolling out separate web sites, applications and mobile apps much more cost efficient as well.
</p>
<p>
     <a title="Seaborne Inc." href="http://seabourneinc.com/projects/contentapi/"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/seabourne-inc/Content-API-Drupal-1.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
</p>
<p>
     <a title="Content APIs" href="http://seabourneinc.com/projects/contentapi/">Content APIs</a> can also open content to the public allowing media, companies and even individuals to pull content and mash it up, evolve, derive meaning and stories from it that a government agency may not have time or even perspective to do. In my opinion this type of content access by the public truly reflects the next generation of democracy, allowing anyone to get involved in government, even demonstrating better ways to understand how government operates.
</p>
<p>
     You can access the <a title="Content API for Drupal" href="http://seabourneinc.com/projects/contentapi/">Content API for Drupal</a> on the Seaborne Inc. website, I’m installing a prototype Drupal website so I can play with the API, helping me understand whats possible when using Drupal in conjunction with the Content API.

        <span class="post-date">20 Oct 2011</span>
        <p>
     <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/self-service.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
</p>
<p>
     At a recent presentation at the <a title="Business of APIs Conference in San Francisco" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/2011/10/06/business-of-apis-conference-in-san-francisco-wrapup/">Business of API conference in San Francisco</a>, Twilio CEO Jeff Lawson argued that two of the ways APIs can be successful in courting new developers are by being self-service and by having a "freemium" option. Both of these features empower developers to start using an API right away, without entering a credit card, talking to customer service, sales or having to wait for budget approval. They can just sign-up, get a key and start hacking!
</p>
<p>
     This shouldn't just be a model for APIs targeting the public developers; it can work with the enterprise as well. This model would allow enterprise developers to get up and running using an API quickly, building their own working prototypes, and in turn, using this prototype to make a case for why a company should use an API -- all without talking to their boss or getting approval.
</p>
<p>
     Of course, an API can still have a traditional sales funnel, where developers can get support, pay for premium services, and engage to get appropriate SLAs. But by providing both a self-service and a freemium option, there is the potential to reach new customers -- customers that may not respond to a traditional enterprise software sales cycle.
</p>
<p>
     I strongly believe that both self-service and freemium have a place with all APIs. These help expose what is needed for developers to see the value an API delivers so they can prove this value to their company; then later, they can engage sales and business departments to strengthen and harden the relationship.
</p>
<p>
     <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/freepremium.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
</p>
<p>
     This approach is gaining acceptance and can be seen across many of the successful APIs in the space, like Twilio Self-Service and freemium pricing are things that all the major API service providers (<a title="3Scale" href="/serviceproviders/3scale.php">3Scale</a>, <a title="Mashery" href="/serviceproviders/mashery.php">Mashery</a> and <a href="/serviceproviders/apigee.php">Apigee</a>) endorse when they advise their customers during setup of their own APIs.
</p>
<p>
     APIs open entirely new channels, attract new customers, and encourage the development of new ways of doing business you could never even imagine on your own! Right? Yet only 3Scale and Mashape actually offer truly self-service, freemium options for their API management platforms. At <a href="http://www.mimeo.com">Mimeo</a> I've deployed entirely new APIs I can't get internal resources for, and I've done so using both 3Scale and Mashape. With their platforms I've built new <a title="document printing APIs" href="http://mimeoconnect.3scale.net/">document printing APIs</a>. I launched these without the help of IT. By doing so, I’m attracting new users and in turn evangelizing internally at <a href="http://www.mimeo.com">Mimeo</a> to get greater buy-in and budgets -- all without engaging with sales, spending money, or getting my budget' approval.
</p>
<p>
     The enterprise can learn a lot from open APIs. Idon't think the traditional enterprise sales process is all bad; it has its place, but it doesn't offer the transparency that is needed in many cases, and where I think many businesses feel they are protecting their intellectual property and delivering a stronger product, they are actually missing the boat on a lot of new business.

        <span class="post-date">18 Oct 2011</span>
        <p>
     <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/Tag-Cloud-REST-URL.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" />
</p>
<p>
     Someone asked me recently for some advice regarding what they should consider when constructing the URL and endpoints for their RESTful API.  I thought I’d share the advice I passed along.
</p>
<p>
     I don't intend this to be a comprehensive guide to building URLs for a true REST API, just some things to consider for the newbie API product manager who may not have a hardcore REST developer on their team.
</p>
<p>
     When planning your endpoints for a RESTful API, there are 3 things I tell people to consider:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <strong>Domain</strong> - Put your API at a separate domain or sub-domain than your website.  It will make it easier to migrate and scale, and your IT team will thank you.  For example: 
          <ul class="mainlist">
               <li>
                    <a href="https://api.yourdomain.com">https://api.yourdomain.com</a>
               </li>
          </ul>
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Versioning</strong> - Make sure and consider the versioning of your API in your URL structure.  How you version will depend on the preferences of your dev team, the most common patterns I see are a v preceding the version number of your API or using year and month of the version.  How often you release may impact your decision.  For example:
          <ul class="mainlist">
               <li>
                    <a href="https://api.peoplebrowsr.com/v1/"><span>https://api.yourdomain.com/v1/</span></a>
               </li>
               <li>
                    <a href="https://api.peoplebrowsr.com/2011/11/"><span>https://api.yourdomain.com/2011/11/</span></a>
               </li>
          </ul>
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Resources</strong> - The next part of your URL should be the resource of what you are offering.  Make it self-describing of the resource you are offering through the endpoint.  Make it reflect what a developer is looking to consume when using your API.  For example:
          <ul class="mainlist">
               <li>
                    <a href="https://api.yourdomain.com/v1/articles/"><span>https://api.yourdomain.com/v1/</span><span>article/</span></a>
               </li>
               <li>
                    <a href="https://api.yourdomain.com/v1/users/"><span>https://api.yourdomain.com/v1/</span><span>user/</span></a>
               </li>
          </ul>
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     How you define your API resources is very important, its something you will have to live with forever.  Make your resource descriptions count, your developers will thank you.
</p>
<p>
     The other thing I strong urge is to offer SSL for your API from day one.  Its not a huge problem down the road, but any change will come with issues, and many of your developers will request and even require SSL in some cases, before they integrate with your API.
</p>
<p>
     That is all the general advice I have, how you describe your resources is up to you, and how RESTful you make the rest of your API is up to your dev team.  I don't get involved in the religious REST arguments, I leave that for the experts.  I just wanted share some of the common things you should consider when constructing your URL endpoints.
</p>
<p>
     Let me know anything I'm missing you REST geeks!

        <span class="post-date">14 Oct 2011</span>

     <a title="USA Today" href="http://developer.usatoday.com/"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/usatoday/USA-Today-Logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>

<p>
     <a title="USA Today" href="http://developer.usatoday.com/">USA Today</a> has announced that they now support the commercial access of articles, reviews and census data through their content APIs.
</p>
<p>
     Any developer can request a key, and start making calls for free, with initial calls being restricted at a default rate. But as applications prove successful they are now willing to increase usage caps on a case-by-case basis. USA Today doesn’t describe what its commercial pricing will be, but they state in their <a title="Terms and Conditions" href="http://developer.usatoday.com/API_Terms_of_Use">terms and conditions</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
     If USAT decides to charge a fee for use of or access to the USAT APIs, such fees will be disclosed to you prior to USAT charging such fees to you.
</blockquote>
<p>
     Every couple of months USA Today rolls out a new API or evolution in their business model, as they get more comfortable with their API. This latest move seems to seems to be centered around encouraging commercial of its census data, which the NY Times makes available for commercial use as well.
</p>
<p>
     Its interesting to watch these media giants evolve their business models using APIs to make themselves more competitive.

        <span class="post-date">14 Oct 2011</span>
        <p>
     <a title="NASA just launched a new Data API" href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2011/10/12/announcing-the-data-nasa-gov-api/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/nasa/open-nasa.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a>
</p>
<p>
     <a title="NASA just launched a new Data API" href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2011/10/12/announcing-the-data-nasa-gov-api/">NASA just launched a new Data API</a> around its online archive of <a title="NASA data sets" href="http://data.nasa.gov/">NASA data sets</a>, that they launched back in August. The data.nasa.gov API provides a RESTful interface, with responses in JSON for the NASA data archives.
</p>
<p>
     The new <a title="NASA Data API" href="http://data.nasa.gov/api-info/">NASA Data API</a> is part of the ongoing <a title="NASA Government Data Plan" href="http://www.nasa.gov/open/plan/index.html">NASA Open Government Plan</a>, providing access to data sets in a variety of categories including aeronautics, climate, earth science, engineering, institutional, life sciences, operations and space sciences.
</p>
<p>
     There is a wealth of data available at data.nasa.gov. The APIs make it easier to access this data, but they are just data APIs. There is a huge opportunity for someone to abstract more meaningful, focused APIs delivering just photos of the moon, weather or climate change related data.
</p>
<p>
     <a title="NASA just launched a new Data API" href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2011/10/12/announcing-the-data-nasa-gov-api/"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/nasa/nasa-data-gov-old-computer.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a>
</p>
<p>
     For example, a developer looking to get earth, moon and other planetary photographs, can find what they are looking for in the data.nasa.gov data sets, but they have to navigate the different categories and build the proper requests to get exactly what they are looking for. Some developers are willing to go through this trouble, while others are not, and will give up quickly.
</p>
<p>
     There is opportunity for someone to deploy a earth photo API, moon photo API and mars photo API for example. These APIs would provide quick access API interfaces around specific and meaningful collections. Developers could quickly build calls pulling the information they need, while non-developers could also syndicate and share using widgets and other embeddable tools.
</p>
<p>
     Its great to see government agencies not only making data available, but deploying APIs making the data easier to access. But there are more opportunities to derive more meaning, and identify new opportunities around these rich archives of data.

</p>
<p>
     I'm getting ready for the <a href="http://www.innovate-conference.com/">X.Commerce Innovate Developer Conference 2011</a>, at Moscone Center in San Francisco this week.
</p>
<p>
     <a href="https://www.x.com/">X.Commerce</a> is the merging of <a href="https://www.x.com/developers/paypal">Paypal</a>, <a href="https://www.x.com/developers/ebay">eBay</a> and <a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/">Magento's</a> developer ecosystems into a single developer community empowering the next generation of merchants who need to operate in the world of global, multi-channel commerce.
</p>
<p>
     The APIs that make up X.Commerce are:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <a href="https://www.x.com/developers/paypal"><strong>Paypal</strong></a> - Website Payment Pro, Express Checkout and Adaptive Payments are a a couple of Paypals Payment APIs that X.Commerce developers can take advantage of.
     </li>
     <li>
          <a href="https://www.x.com/developers/ebay"><strong>eBay</strong></a> - The hardened suite of search, trading and buying APIs from the popular auction platform that was one of the <a title="early pioneers of the web API space" href="/2011/01/26/history-of-apis-ebay/">early pioneers in the web API space</a>.
     </li>
     <li>
          <a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/"><strong>Magento</strong></a> - The API allows access to the Customer, Catalog and Order modules of any users Magento E-Commerce account.
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     X.Commerce strives to bring together Marketplace, Payment, Mobile Products into a single developer ecosystem, with essential Account Management, Information and Reporting Products.
</p>
<p>
     Even though you still have to go out to each individual sites developer ecosystems, you can tell they are working to bring together the communities in a central next generation merchant portal.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/10/08/unlocking-government-data-with-socrata/">Unlocking Government Data with Socrata</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">08 Oct 2011</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.socrata.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/socrata/Socrata-Open-Data-Company.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I was introduced to the API service provider <a title="Socrata" href="http://www.socrata.com/">Socrata</a> last week.  Socrata has a government data platform that exceeds anything I&rsquo;ve envisioned.  In the past, I have said that <a title="Every State Should Have an API" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/09/06/every-city-should-have-an-api-lets-start-with-watertown-ma/">every state should have an API</a>.&nbsp;Socrata looks like that platform.</p>
<p>Socrata says it best:  <em>&ldquo;Social Data Discovery Solution Promotes Civic Engagement, Improves Decision and Policy Making, and Achieves Government Transparency.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Socrata defines "<a title="Social Data Discovery" href="http://www.socrata.com/discover/">Social Data Discovery</a>" as a solution for public and private institutions to transform raw data, contained in large departmental databases, and deploy using the latest web and API technologies. &nbsp;According to Socrata:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Social Data Discovery promotes civic engagement, enabling an online community of journalists, policy makers, scientists/domain experts, and citizens to visualize data and engage in discussion with one another. Together, audiences with disparate viewpoints  can analyze and discover insights from datasets, improving decision and  policy making.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>They seems to get the political, technical and economic challenges faced when delivering government data solutions, and provide a very comprehensive solution for city, county, state and federal agencies to manage their data:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Data-Set On-Boarding</strong> - A process, acknowledging the need to clean and transform data so its accessible by an external audience.</li>
<li><strong>Web APIs </strong>- Ability to deploy RESTful APIs with for data sets with a key for authentication. </li>
<li><strong>Datasets and Feeds </strong>- Availablity of datasets in common formats like CSV, TSV, XML, KML,  and Atom.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile</strong> - The platform appears to deliver necessary resources for iPhone, Android, and Blackery mobile platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Management</strong> - Socrata appears to offer many of the essential API maangement services as other providers.</li>
<li><strong>Analytics</strong> - Provides the necessary reporting and analytics to make sense of how data is being consumed and distributed.</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem with trying to get data from government agencies, is often that you end up with PDF and MIcrosoft Excel reports, and not the quality data feeds and APIs developers need.  In my post, &ldquo;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/09/06/every-city,-county-and-state-should-have-an-api/">Every City, County and State Should Have an API</a>&rdquo;, I identify that government workers are only working with the tools we give them.   They need better tools.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.socrata.com/"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/socrata/Socrata-Data-Overview.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>Socrata looks like just the tool for the job.  Socrata appears to have all the key elements that government agencies will need to manage, publish and share important data with other agencies and the public using &ldquo;Social Data Discovery&rdquo;.  I&rsquo;m thoroughly impressed with what they&rsquo;ve delivered for our government in the form of <a title="Data.gov" href="http://explore.data.gov/">Data.gov</a>.  They also provide solutions for <a title="Medicare" href="http://www.socrata.com/customer-spotlight/medicare/">MediCare</a>, <a title="State of Oregon" href="http://www.socrata.com/customer-spotlight/state-of-oregon/">State of Oregon</a>, <a title="State of Oklahoma" href="http://www.socrata.com/customer-spotlight/state-of-oklahoma/">State of Oklahoma</a>, <a title="City of Seattle" href="http://www.socrata.com/customer-spotlight/city-of-seattle/">City of Seattle</a> and <a title="City of Chicago" href="http://www.socrata.com/customer-spotlight/city-of-chicago/">City of Chicago</a>, among others.</p>
<p>This is just my first look at the platform.  I will be spending more time evaluating what they offer.  If you&rsquo;d like to understand Socrata better, I recommend starting with the <a title="solutions tour" href="http://www.socrata.com/solutions/solution-tour/">solutions tour</a>, then downloading their <a title="product white paper" href="http://socrata.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Socrata_Social_Data_Discovery-Government.pdf?mkt_tok=3RkMMJWWfF9wsRonuKzOZKXonjHpfsX%2B6%2BwtXrHr08Yy0EZ5VunJEUWy2YMDT9QhcOuuEwcWGog80wNbCOGBfQ%3D%3D">product white paper</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Oct 2011</span>
        <p>
     <a title="Instructure" href="http://www.instructure.com/"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/instructure/Instructure_logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
</p>
<p>
     I had a great response to my <a title="Learning Management System API Roundup" href="/2011/10/02/learning-management-system-(lms)-apis/">Learning Management System (LMS) APIs round-up</a> last week after <a title="Startup Weekend Seattle EDU" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/09/30/40-education-apis-for-startup-weekend-seattle-edu/">Startup Weekend Seattle EDU</a>. After posting I quickly updated with another LMS suggestion I got for <a title="Sakai" href="https://confluence.sakaiproject.org/dosearchsite.action?queryString=api">Sakai</a>. Then a couple days ago the PR director for <a title="Instructure" href="http://www.instructure.com/">Instructure</a> introduced me to their <a title="LMS Platform Canvas" href="http://www.instructure.com/">LMS platform, Canvas</a>.
</p>
<p>
     Canvas is a open-source LMS created by Instructure and released under the AGPLv3 license. Instructure also provides a cloud version, with all the features of the open source version of Canvas, but comes with hosting, mobile apps, services integration, and automated provisioning.
</p>
<p>
     <a title="Instructure" href="http://www.instructure.com/"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/instructure/Instructure-LMS-Classroom.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>
</p>
<p>
     The <a title="Canvas MLS includes a REST API" href="https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/index.html">Canvas LMS includes a REST API</a>, using OAuth for authentication, enforces SSL, with all API responses in JSON. The API is currently under development and many areas of the application are still unavailable via the external API, but there are still quite a few methods available for the LMS already, and more to come.
</p>
<p>
     The Canvas solution appears to have all the latest features of a modern software as a service platform. They provide an open-source version, as well as a hosted platform.  Its built with Ruby, on a PostGres database, and runs on the Amazon Cloud.  The API is simple, and they intend to expose all features of the core LMS via the API, with all documentation hosted at Github.
</p>
<p>
     When the API is complete, I’d definitely say that the Instructure Canvas and API is the most robust LMS solution I’ve come across so far. When they finish their API, and pull together a community around the API, they will definitely be a strong force in the LMS space.

<p><a href="http://blog.factual.com/factual-app-gallery">Factual has launch a new application gallery</a> to showcase the diverse number of applications built using data provided by Factual.</p>
<p>You can search for apps, browse by category, and filter by open source, paid or free apps. &nbsp;Looks like there are about 18 apps in the directory currently ranging from augmented reality to daily deals.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.factual.com/gallery">Factual App Gallery</a> isn&rsquo;t a particularly unique launch, we are seeing <a title="App Showcase" href="/buildingblocks/app_gallery.php">app showcases</a> popup within many APIs, but it shows that Factual is gaining steam, and I think it shows the appetite for building apps around datasets is growing.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/10/08/distributed-and-seamless-api-management-using-3scale-apis/">Distributed and Seamless API Management Using 3Scale APIs</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">08 Oct 2011</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.3scale.net/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-service-providers/3scale-logo.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I just added four new API to my API stack series.  I&rsquo;m considering breaking the API Stack series into a separate feed, they kind of clutter the main feed.  Anyways, the four new APIs are from <a title="3Scale" href="/serviceproviders/3scale.php">3Scale</a>:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="Service Management API" href="/2011/10/08/api-stack-api-service-management-with-3scale-service-management-api/">Service Management API</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a title="Account Management API" href="/2011/10/08/api-stack-api-account-management-with-3scale-account-management-api-/">Account Management API</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a title="Analytics API" href="/2011/10/08/api-stack-api-analytics-with-3scale-analytics-api-/">Analytics API</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a title="Billing API" href="/2011/10/08/api-stack-api-billing-with-3scale-billing-api-/">Billing API</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>These four APIs offer the essential building blocks to control, manage and monetize the distribution of data, content and services via a web API. &nbsp;3Scale has had their <a title="Service Management API" href="http://www.3scale.net/support/service-management-api">Service Management API</a> for a while, but recently <a title="added the account, analytics and billing services" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2011/10/06/api-management-within-your-existing-platform/">added the account, analytics and billing services</a>, making a complete set of API management APIs.</p>
<p>3Scale already has two significant differentiors from other API managerment service providers:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Proxy-Less</strong> - 3Scale is different than the other service providers in that they don't proxy your APIs.  3Scale only uses a "connector" to integrate the services you want into your API. </li>
<li><strong>Self-Service</strong> - 3Scale is the only self-service API management service with a freemium model.  Well, except for&nbsp;<a title="Mashape" href="/serviceproviders/mashape.php">Mashape</a>, they do to, but are in beta currently. </li>
</ul>
<p>Adding a set of APIs, definitely sets 3Scale apart from the other <a title="API Management Service Providers" href="/serviceproviders/">API management service providers</a>.  You can sign-up, connect 3Scale services to your API, without routing your API through a proxy, and seamlessly integrate 3Scale service, account and billing management into your existing systems, complete with analytics.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-service-providers/3Scale/API-Management -3scale-API-Management-Solution.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>Using 3Scale you can operate for free up to 50K calls per day, and start paying after your API grows or once you are looking to monetize your API and begin billing users.</p>
<p>Since <a title="3Scale" href="/serviceproviders/3scale.php">3Scale</a> has a freemium model, I can play around with a lot of different deployments, until I find the configuration I'm looking for.   I think I'll launch an API for <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://www.apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> using 3Scale.  See if I can integrate 3Scale service and user management into my existing CMS, and deploy some API analytics.  I don't have anything at the moment I'd feel good about billing for, but maybe some day.</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Oct 2011</span>
        <p><a href="http://klout.com/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/klout/klout-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I <a title="attended the Business of APIs Conference in San Francisco" href="/2011/10/06/business-of-apis-conference-in-san-francisco-wrapup/">attended Mashery's Business of APIs Conference in San Francisco</a> last week.  There were a lot of great API presentations,  but I thought one really told a great story in-line with the focus of the event, which is the <a title="Business of APIs" href="/business_of_apis.php">Business of APIs</a>.</p>
<p>Tyler Singletary(<a title="@harmophone" href="http://twitter.com/#!/harmophone">@harmophone</a>), Developer Evangelist at <a title="Klout" href="http://klout.com/">Klout</a>, told a story around how they are continuing to grow, control and monetize Klout, while also ensuring Klout continues to have meaning and deliver value.</p>
<p><a href="http://klout.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/klout/klout.JPG" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Klout's value lies in brand awareness, integrity and the meaning, usefulness and value of the Klout Score to consumers and businesses.  To continue offering value and maintaing the integrity of the brand, they are creating a dynamic way to manage their API community, incentivize postive usage of the API, while controlling negative usage.</p>
<p>To build awareness of the Klout brand, and increase value, Klout depends on properly displaying of Klout Score and Klout Logo, and linking back to Klout profiles.  The more value an API user delivers to the Klout brand the more relaxed Klout can be on quotas, rate limits and even pricing.</p>
<p>Not all API users will deliver the same value to the Klout brand, competitors may access data, and application may use scores in a more programmatical way, and not have the desired awareness generating value of other implementations. In these cases Klout can impose tariffs, implementing much stricter quotas, rate limits and charge more for accessing the API.</p>
<p>Through a dynamic terms of service, branding guidelines, and pricing, Klout can adjust these business controls based upon how much value an API user brings to the Klout brand, establishing a desired balance within their API ecosystem.  Finding that sweet spot where they are delivering the desired units of value to their consumers, while protecting, growing and building value in the Klout brand, even generating revenue it where it makes sense.</p>
<p><a href="http://klout.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/klout/klout-plus-k.jpg" alt="" width="125" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I really like Tyler's transparent way telling the story of how Klout is defining its business model, and employing their API to deliver maximum value to their business.  Their dynamic approach to incentivize and tariff their community, using their terms of service, branding guidelines and pricing is something I'll be thinking about a lot more.</p>
<p>Klout will be presenting at the <a title="Business of APIs in New York" href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/2025693905?ref=ebtn">Business of APIs in New York</a>.  I recommend attending to learn more about how <a title="Klout" href="http://klout.com/">Klout</a> is approaching the business of their API.</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Oct 2011</span>
        <p><a title="Mimeo" href="http://www.mimeo.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/mimeo/mimeo-logo-250.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>At <a title="Mimeo" href="http://www.mimeo.com">Mimeo</a> we have demo Fridays where anyone can demo what they&rsquo;re working on.  For demo Fridays I tend to build prototypes showing different ways to integrate with the <a title="Mimeo Document Printing APIs" href="http://mimeoconnect.3scale.net/">Mimeo Document Printing APIs</a>.  As my schedule has gotten busier this fall, with more developer support, and attending hackathons and conferences, I don&rsquo;t always have time to polish a prototype for Friday demos.</p>
<p>So this Fridays demo I started showcasing some of the ideas I&rsquo;m brainstorming with other developers, and the potential ways they might use our APIs.  Here are the four I demoed today:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="/admin/Blog/"><strong>Cabana</strong></a> - Very sexy, GUI mobile application development environment I saw demo at BAPI.  I want to understand more about how they will integrate APIs into the mobile building environment.</li>
<li><a href="/admin/Blog/"><strong>Breezy</strong></a> - Breezy launched their mobile printing network last month, allowing you to print to Fedex Office, local print shops, coffee shops and hotels from your mobile device.  I am brainstorming how to print common business documents using Mimeo and have delivered next day using Breezy.</li>
<li><a href="/admin/Blog/"><strong>PicPlum</strong></a> - Let&rsquo;s you email or upload photos into a queue and when ready add contacts and have photos printed and delivered to your family and friends.</li>
<li><a href="/admin/Blog/"><strong>Chute</strong></a> - A centrally located backup, syncing and photo sharing platform.  Its currently in beta, but I got a look at the back-end, and its a very powerful photo management and distribution platform.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not all of these projects I demoed are guaranteed to go anywhere.  Some of the photo products at Mimeo, still need APIs exposed before I can offer some of the more specialized photo printing services.  However showing the types of projects developers are engaging me on, creates more awareness within the company about what developers want, and opens up the floor for comments and valuable feedback.</p>
<p>Internal API evangelism is an ever increasing part of my API evangelist role.  Making everyone at Mimeo aware of what I am doing with our APIs, as well as what other types of platforms and APIs are available,  all contributes to more awareness and engagement across the company.</p>

<p>I'm spending a lot of time lately evaluating the various API management service providers like <a title="3Scale" href="/serviceproviders/3scale.php">3Scale</a>, <a title="Apigee" href="/serviceproviders/apigee.php">Apigee</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Mashery" href="/serviceproviders/mashery.php">Mashery</a>,and&nbsp;<a title="Mashape" href="/serviceproviders/mashape.php">Mashape</a>.</p>
<p>One thing that I have to explain a lot to people about these API management services&hellip;is they are API management services.  Not API deployment services.</p>
<p>The only one provider that has a solution to deploy your API is <a title="Mashape" href="/serviceproviders/mashape.php">Mashape</a>, but now there is a new provider gearing up, called <a title="Apiary.io" href="http://apiary.io/">Apiary.io</a>.  Apiary.io wants to make developing and implementing APIs a quicker process.</p>
<p>Apiary.io site says they will also help you describe, test, manage and share your API with developers.</p>
<p>I feel that API deployment services is a huge opportunity in this space, its good to see a provider step up that will help API owners deploy their APIs, as well as manage them.</p>
<p><a title="Apiary.io" href="http://apiary.io/">Apiary.io</a> is still in private Beta, so I can't take it for a spin yet.  It will be interesting to learn more about what this latest API service provider can bring to the table.</p>

     <a title="Business of APIs Conference" href="http://apiconference.com/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/events/Business-of-APIs-Conference-2011.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a>
</p>
<p>
     I finished up the <a title="Mashery" href="http://www.mashery.com">Mashery</a>, <a title="Business of APIs Conference" href="http://apiconference.com/">Business of APIs Conference</a> in San Francisco on Tuesday.  After a days rest and reflection on the event I wanted to capture my thoughts on BAPI - SF.  
</p>
<p>
     The turnout was impressive.  I got to see a lot of familiar faces, was introduced to some new APIs and met a few new folks looking to transform their businesses using APIs.  
</p>
<p>
     On the 16 presentations I saw, here are some of my thoughts:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li class="c2">
          <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/events/business-of-apis-2011/daniel.JPG" alt="" width="175" align="right" />
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Daniel Jacobson</strong> - I have seen Daniel talk several times, so I'm familiar with his talk, but he adds new slides each time.  Always love seeing how they are solving internal and partner needs with their APIs, as well helping them achieve world domination using APIs and the Amazon cloud.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Adam Trachtenberg</strong> - There were three things I took away from listening to Andy.  1) Your API should get all the same love and attention as your primary business.  2)  Hold Hackathons within your own company to encourage innovation 3) LinkedIn is a model of how any API should employ embeddable buttons and widgets around their API.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Steve Citron-Poust</strong> -  I need to watch his pitch again.  His speaking style was engaging so I was drawn in by his perspective of ecosystem management, and didn't take good enough notes.  He offers a very realist perspective of managing your developers, and the differences in managing a private-label, partner API platform.

     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>John Musser</strong> - John always has a very concise view of the entire API industry, showing the growth, and helping us understand the scope and depth of this growth.  ProgrammableWeb recently hit 4K APIs in its directory, showing some phenomenal growth in number of APIs, but also by industry, and varying ways companies are monetizing their APIs.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Neel Ketkar</strong> - Neel from Rovi talked about the advantages of an open API, and the importance of providing a feedback framework for your developers and incorporating feedback into your roadmap.  Neel also urged the importance of having a flexible API infrastructure allowing for change, because you will have to continually evolve how you deliver your services.  But one nugget I walked away with, that I'm evolving as separate story, is "arming your corporate sales team with APIs", how this can be a very empowering differentiator.

     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Tyler Singletary</strong> - Tyler takes home the grand prize for the most relevant presentation, reflecting the mission of the event, which is the Business of APIs.  His presenation is fulll of valuable insights into how to approach your API business model, how it relates to your TOS and branding guidelines.  I'm working on a completely separate story about Tylers presentation at BAPI.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Marie Alexander</strong> - Unfortunately I don't have much feedback on the fireside chat with Marie from Quova.  I ran out of power, because Mashery didn't have power plugs for press(:(), so I went out of room to charge and ended up talking to other folks.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Ben Metcalfe</strong> - I think Ben offers some very realistic advice for API owners, that is grounded in actual experience in bulding and implementing API strategy for small and enterprise level businesses.   I need to talk to Ben more about what his Swordfi.sh company offers.
     </li>
     <li class="c2">
          <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/events/business-of-apis-2011/abraham.JPG" alt="" width="175" align="right" />
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Abraham Williams</strong> - Thoroughly entertained by Abrahams presention on Unicorns (developers), and how to manage and encourage them within your community.  I've seen his pitch a couple times and it gets more polished each time.  I don't want to call his talk "the basics", I think "the essentials", is more appropriate.  Every business looking to launch an API should watch his talk.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Seth Blank</strong> - I'm am super excited by any talk that can use the words Fuck and API together so much.  He had a very colorful presentation about what developers love and hate about APIs.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Dave Carroll</strong> - Dave is the extremely wise and cool uncle of the API space.  Saleforce is one of the elders in the space, and Dave has been there the whole time, so he gets it at a level I think many of us can't quite see.  He demonstrates the important role APIs have played in current and future sucess of Salesforce.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Ryan Sarver</strong> - Ryan gave a very polished view of Twitter and its API ecosystem.  I don't think Victoria asked the hard questions, but we got some insight into how they view their often troubled developer ecosystem, and what Twitter would like to see.  I'm uploading a video I took of his talk, and will post a separate post about it after I watch again.
     </li>

     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Jeff Lawson</strong> - Always love watching Jeff give a talk.  I've seen this one 3 times now, but he shoots from the hip and evolves it each time.  So much to learn from Twilio, but the nugget I walked away with this time was APIs should have a self-service model, as well as a sales funnel for approach enterprise sales.  Its a model that works well across the board, not just the enterprise.
     </li>
     <li>
          <strong>Reeve S. Thompson</strong> - Ok, was totally blown by the Cabana mobile app builder.  I talked with Reeve Thompson for a bit, and looking forward to talking more.  They build a mobile app using both the Twitter and Klout API in 300 seconds, live during the demo.  They are the vision I was talking about in <a title="Widget Building Platform for APIs" href="/2011/06/22/widget-builder-environment-for-apis/">Widget Builder Environment for APIs</a>, but for mobile.

<p>
     Overall BAPI was a great experience, except for that one dude I spilled a glass of water on his leg.  So sorry man!!
</p>
<p>
     I'm really looking forward to the New York <a title="New York event October 19th" href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/2025693905?ref=ebtn">New York event October 19th</a> and if I can afford to, I will be going to the <a title="London event October 25th" href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/2025746061?ref=ebtn">London event on October 25th</a>.  If you want to help <a title="Audrey Watters" href="http://www.hackeducation.com/">Audrey</a> and I get there, let me know!  :)
</p>
<p>
     I'm still working on a couple other side stories from the event, I will post them when they are ready.  The registration is still open for both events. I highly recommend getting to at least one of them if you can.

     That is a whole lot of API experience. I went to BAPI last year, and the talks were great and I connected with a bunch of other API experts, during the half-day event.
