        <span class="post-date">12 Apr 2017</span>
        <p><a href="http://google.stack.network/">I have been profiling all of the Google APIs lately</a>, a process that always yields a significant amount of stories for my notebook. One element of Google's approach to delivering APIs that <a href="https://developers.google.com/+/web/">I found relevant in the Google+ portal, was their embeddable tooling</a>. This is an area of the API lifecycle I'm regularly evangelizing, and always looking for good examples to support my research.</p>
<p>I think that the six embeddable tools Google offers up as part of their social API represent the top embeddable tooling I see across this space. Partially because of the dominance of social media platform, but also because they make sense to end-users, and accomplish common things that people want to accomplish online.</p>
<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/+/web/"><img style="padding: 10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/google_embeddables.png" alt="" width="98%" /></a></p>
<p>Share, follow, and vote buttons are relevant to any platform with user accounts. Is yours available via API, enabling this type of tools? Then the badges, snippets, and embedded posts are relevant to any company, organization, institution, and agency looking to share content over the web (everyone wants to do this). I'm going to start a list of essential embeddable building blocks, providing a getting started list for companies looking to develop embeddable tooling for their consumers--Google gives me another good reference to add to my research.</p>
<p>I wish someone would start an API embeddables service, something like Zapier, but for embeddable content, tooling, and actions. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/02/08/api-embeddables-in-a-conversational-interface-world/">I've talked about this in terms of conversational interfaces</a>, but think there is an opportunity to do specifically for API-driven content. Allowing people to easily authenticate, and generate profile badges, embeddable content listings and details, and other long tail content opportunities. I'll keep beating this drum until something emerges--because it is what I do.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/04/12/open-source-drag-and-drop-api-lifecycle-design-tooling/">Open Source Drag And Drop API Lifecycle Design Tooling</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">12 Apr 2017</span>
        <p><a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/working-with-templates-cfn-designer.html"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/aws_cloud_formation_designer.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm always on the hunt for new ways to define, design, deploy, and manage API infrastructure, and thought the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/working-with-templates-cfn-designer.html">AWS Cloud Formation Designer</a> provides a nice look at where things might be headed.&nbsp;<span>AWS CloudFormation Designer (Designer) is a graphic tool for creating, viewing, and modifying AWS CloudFormation templates, which translates pretty nicely to managing your API infrastructure as well.</span></p>
<p><span>While the AWS Cloud Formation Designer spans all AWS services, all the elements are there for managing all the core stops along the API life cycle liked definition, design, DNS, deployment, management, monitoring, and others. Each of the Amazon services is available with a listing of each element available for the service, complete with all the inputs and outputs as connectors on the icons. Since all the AWS services are APIs, it's basically a drag and drop interface for mapping out how you use these APIs to define, design, deploy and manage your API infrastructure.</span></p>
<p>Using the design tool you can create templates for governing the deployment and management of API infrastructure&nbsp;by your team, partners, and other customers. This approach to defining the API life cycle is the closest I've seen to what stimulated <a href="http://subway.map.apievangelist.com/">my API subway map work</a>, which became&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/29/the-api-lifecycle-my-talk-from-defrag-and-apistrat/">the subject of my keynotes at APIStrat in Austin, TX</a>. It allows API architects and providers to templatize their approaches to delivering API infrastructure, in a way that is plug and play, and evolvable using the underlying JSON or YAML templates--right alongside the OpenAPI templates, we are crafting for each individual API.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;AWS Cloud Formation Designer is a drag and drop UI for <a href="http://amazon.web.services.stack.network/">the entire AWS API stack</a>. It is something that could easily be applied to <a href="http://google.stack.network/">Google's API stack</a>, Microsoft, or any other stack you define--something that could easily be done <a href="http://apisjson.org">using APIs.json</a>, developing another layer of templating for which resource types are available in the designer, as well as the formation templates generated by the design tool itself. There should be an open source "API formation designer" available, that could span cloud providers, allowing architects to define which resources are available in their toolbox--that anyone could fork and run in their environment.</p>
<p>I like where AWS is headed with their&nbsp;Cloud Formation Designer. It's another approach to providing full lifecycle tooling for use in the API space. It almost reminds me of Yahoo Pipes for the AWS Cloud, which triggers awkward feels for me. I'm hoping it is a glimpse of what's to come, and someone steps up with an even more attractive drag and drop version, that helps folks work with API-driven&nbsp;infrastructure no matter where it runs--maybe Google will get to work on something. They seem to be real big on supporting infrastructure that runs in any cloud environment. *wink wink*</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/04/12/exploring-github-curated-galleries/">Exploring Github Curated Galleries</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">12 Apr 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/explore"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/github_explore_showcases.png" alt="" width="50%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Github has long been my number one source for discovering people doing interesting things with APIs. As I was trying to articulate how API providers can put Github to work as part of their API operations in another story, I came across <a href="https://github.com/explore">the Github Explore section</a>. I thought that the list of items on the home page helps demonstrate that Github is more than just about managing open source code--which is the common perception regarding what you do with Github amongst muggles.</p>
<p>I feel that these nine areas reflect the top uses for Github in 2017:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/showcases/policies">Policies</a></strong> - From federal governments to corporations to student clubs, groups of all sizes are using GitHub to share, discuss, and improve laws.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/showcases/tools-for-open-source">Tools for Open Source</a></strong> - Software to make running your open source project a little bit easier.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/showcases/open-source-organizations">Open source organizations</a> </strong>- A showcase of organizations showcasing their open source projects.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/showcases/design-essentials">Design essentials</a> -</strong> This collection of design libraries are the best on the web, and will complete your toolset for designing stunning products.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/showcases/social-impact">Social Impact</a> -</strong> Open source projects that are making the world a better place.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/showcases/open-data">Open data</a> -</strong> Examples of using GitHub to store, publish and collaborate on open, machine-readable datasets.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/showcases/package-managers">Package managers</a> -</strong> Across programming languages and platforms, these popular package managers make it easy to distribute reusable libraries and plugins.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/showcases/devops-tools">DevOps tools</a> -</strong> These tools help you manage servers and deploy happier and more often with more confidence.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/showcases/machine-learning">Machine learning</a> -</strong> Laying the foundations for Skynet</li>
</ul>
<p>There are other galleries available via <a href="https://github.com/explore">the Github Explore section</a>, but I think this list provides a nice snapshot. I was pleased to see open data as a showcase, which included the <a href="https://apis.guru/">APIs.guru API directory</a>, something I'd like to see become an entire category of API catalogs and directories. It also makes sense that the foundations for Skynet are being laid using Github as part of its machine learning showcase.</p>
<p>It is important to also note that the first area on this list is policies. Providing some important leadership for city, state, and federal government agencies to follow when it comes to crafting policy in an observable way via Github. While not an antidote for all the illnesses of government, it provides an environment where the sunshine&nbsp;can be let in to disinfect the process just a bit.</p>
<p>While code is still the central focus of engagement on Github, I think the open data,&nbsp;machine learning, and policy galleries reflect the shifting landscape of what happens on Github. I'm investing some time into crafting more Github 101 stories for API providers and consumers, and will also be improving my own discovery process using the social platform, as there are numerous signals to tune into these days, and the explore galleries is one interesting layer&nbsp;that I'll be keeping an eye on regularly.</p>

        <span class="post-date">11 Apr 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-question-mark.png" alt="" width="30%" align="right" /></p>
<p>Mike Ralphson&rlm; (<a href="https://twitter.com/PermittedSoc">@PermittedSoc</a>) asked me the other day, "<a href="https://twitter.com/PermittedSoc/status/847814927792451586">if you could run SQL / #GraphQL queries over nearly 50K #API definitions, what would you ask?</a>". I told him I would respond via blog post, which is one way I help amplify the conversation I have with other API folks in the space. Mike is doing som important work when it comes to API discovery, something that needs amplification&nbsp;if we are going to move this conversation forward.</p>
<p>Ok, so what would I ask of nearly 50K API definitions, if I had the opportunity to ask? Here are some of my answers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What are all the paths used? -</strong> I'd like to see a list of all path folders, separated by the&nbsp;forward slash, minus any parameters.</li>
<li><strong>What paths folders&nbsp;actually are words? -</strong> I'd like to know how coherent API design patterns are, and how many are actually words in a dictionary.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>What are all the tags applied? - </strong>A listing of all tags applied to APIs, with counts for each time it is used.</li>
<li><strong>What are all the parameters? -</strong> A listing of all the parameters applied to APIs, with counts for each used.</li>
<li><strong>What are all the definitions -</strong> A listing of all definitions used as part of API requests and responses, with counts next to each.</li>
<li><strong>How many don't have definitions?</strong> What percentage of the API definitions do not have definitions describing their responses</li>
<li><strong>What businesses are involved?&nbsp;</strong>- A listing of all companies involved with API definitions from contact information to domain ownership.</li>
<li><strong>What is whois information behind each domain(s)? -</strong> Pull whois information for all the domains involved in API definitions.</li>
<li><strong>Which definitions do not have path summary or description? -</strong> Which definitions have omitted the description for the path.</li>
<li><strong>What's</strong><strong>&nbsp;the average length of path summary and descriptions? </strong>- Of the definitions with a description or summary, what is the average length?</li>
<li><strong>How many APIs provide a link to terms of service? - </strong>Checking to see if a term of service is part of the definition.</li>
<li><strong>How many APIs provide contact information for an API?&nbsp;-</strong> Checking to see if contact information is part of the definition.</li>
<li><strong>How many APIs describe their headers? -</strong> Looking for specific headers described as part of each path definition.</li>
<li><strong>How many APIs use the body as part of their request? -</strong> Looking for heavy body use as part of the request surface area of an API.</li>
<li><strong>How many APIs have a security definition? -</strong> Which of the APIs has provided a definition for how an API is secured?</li>
<li><strong>How many APIs do not use response codes? -</strong> Which of the APIs do not provide response codes for their API responses?</li>
<li><strong>Which API response HTTP status codes used? -</strong> Provide a list of API response HTTP status codes used, with counts for each.</li>
</ul>
<p>That is a starting list of what I'd like to ask of 50K API definitions. It is something I'd have to think and write about more to be able to come up with more creative questions. I recommend publishing them all to a Github repository and let people start asking questions via an interface. You might not be able to answer all of the questions, but it would be interesting to see what people want to know--I am sure you could develop a pretty interesting look at how folks see API discovery, and what they are looking for.</p>
<p>API discovery is one of the areas of the API life cycle that is pretty deficient due to how people view their APIs and how they often have their blinders on regarding the wider API community. Most folks are thinking about their APIs, and maybe a handful of other APIs they are familiar with but do not consider API usage across industries, or the entire space. We need more work like this to occur. We need more API definitions to be made available, as well as more dynamic ways for folks to discover, understand and learn about APIs that already exist.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/04/11/openapi-as-an-api-literacy-tool/">OpenAPI As An API Literacy Tool</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">11 Apr 2017</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/learning_tag_cloud.jpg" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p>I've been an advocate for <a href="http://openapis.org">OpenAPI</a> since it's release, writing hundreds of stories about what is possible. I do not support OpenAPI because I think it is the perfect solution, I support it because I think it is the scaffolding for a bridge that will get us closer to a suitable solution for the world we have. I'm always studying how people see OpenAPI, both positive and negative, in hopes of better crafting examples of it being used, and stories about what is possible with the specification.</p>
<p>When you ask people what <a href="http://openapis.org">OpenAPI</a> is for, the most common answer is <a href="http://documentation.apievangelist.com">documentation</a>. The second most common answer is for generating <a href="http://sdk.apievangelist.com">code and SDKs</a>. People often associate documentation and code generation with OpenAPI because these were the first two tools that were developed on top of the API specification. I do not see much pushback from the folks who don't like OpenAPI when it comes to documentation, but when it comes to generating code, I regularly see folks criticizing the concept of generating code using OpenAPI definitions.</p>
<p>When I think about OpenAPI I think about a life cycle full of tools and services that can be delivered, with documentation and code generation being just two of them. I feel it is shortsighted to dismiss OpenAPI because it falls short in any single stop along the API lifecycle as I feel the most important role for OpenAPI is when it comes to API literacy--helping us craft, share, and teach API best practices.</p>
<p>OpenAPI, API Blueprint, and other API definition formats are the best way we currently have to define, share, and articulate APIs in a single document. Sure, a well-designed hypermedia API allows you to navigate, explore, and understand the surface area of an API, but how do you summarize that in a shareable and collaborative document that can be also used for documentation, monitoring, testing, and other stops along the API life cycle. </p>
<p>I wish everybody could read the latest API design book and absorb the latest concepts for building the best API possible. Some folks learn this way, but in my experience, a significant segment of the community learn from seeing examples of API best practices in action. API definition formats allow us to describe the moving parts of an API request and response, which then provides an example that other API developers can follow when crafting their own APIs. I find that many people simply follow the API examples they are familiar with, and OpenAPI allows us to easily craft and shares these examples for them to follow.</p>
<p>If we are going to do APIs at the scale we need to help folks craft RESTful web APIs, as well as hypermedia, GraphQL, and gRPC APIs. We need a way to define our APIs, and articulate this definition to our consumers, as well as to other API providers. This helps me remember to not get hung up on any single use of OpenAPI, and other API specification formats, because first and foremost, these formats help us with API literacy, which has wider implications than any single API implementation, or stops along the API life cycle.</p>

        <span class="post-date">11 Apr 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/oxford_prototype_questions.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>Establishing a feedback loop with your API community is one of the most valuable aspects of doing APIs, opening up your organization to ideas from outside your firewall. When you are designing new APIs&nbsp;or the next generation of your APIs, make sure you are tapping into the feedback loop you have already created within your community, by providing access to the alpha, beta, and prototype versions of your APIs.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com/">The Oxford Dictionaries API is doing this with their latest additions to their stack of word related APIs</a>, by <a href="https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com/our-data">providing early access for their community with two of their new API prototypes that are currently in development:</a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Oxford English Dictionary (OED)</strong> is the definitive authority on the English language containing the meaning, history, and pronunciation of more than 280,000 entries &ndash; past and present &ndash; from across the English-speaking world. Its historical record of the English language is traced through more than 3.5 million quotations ranging from classic literature and specialist periodicals to film scripts and cookery books.</li>
<li><strong>bab.la</strong> offers quick and easy translations and answers to everyday language questions. As part of the Oxford Dictionaries family, it provides practical support to people using a language that is not their mother tongue.</li>
</ul>
<p>To get access to the new prototypes, <a href="https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com/our-data">all you have to do is fill out a short questionnaire</a>, and they will consider giving you access to the prototype APIs. It is interesting to review the questions they ask developers, which help qualify users&nbsp;but also asks some questions that could potentially impact the design of the API. The Oxford Dictionaries API team is smart to solicit some external feedback from developers before getting too far down the road developing your API&nbsp;and making it available in any production environment.</p>
<p>I do not think all companies, organizations, and government agencies have it in their DNA to design APIs in this way. There are also some concerns when you are doing this in highly competitive environments, but there are also some competitive advantages in doing this regularly, and developing a strong R&amp;D group within your API ecosystem--even if your competitors get a look at things. I'm going to be flagging API providers who approach API development in this way&nbsp;and start developing a list of best practices to consider when it comes to including your API community in the design and development process, and leveraging their feedback loop in this way.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Apr 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/oxford_university_press_blue_circuit.jpg" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/04/10/my-oxford-dictionaries-talk-about-the-world-of-apis/">I recently gave a talk to the API group over at Oxford University Press</a>. During the discussion, one of their team members asked me about the paradox of what I was advising as&nbsp;the API Evangelist. He was speaking of the dangers of opening up APIs, establishing logging and awareness layers for all the data, content, and algorithms being served up as part of everything we do online. My prepared talk for the conversation was purposefully optimistic, but the conversation also was about the realities of all of this on the ground, at a company like the <a href="http://global.oup.com/?cc=gb">Oxford University Press</a>--making the conversation a pretty good look at the paradox of API evangelism for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/01/12/why-i-still-believe-in-apisthe-2017-edition/">I still believe in the potential of APIs</a>, although I'm increasingly troubled by how APIs are used by technology companies. So it is easy for me to slip into the optimistic&nbsp;API Evangelist, over the hellfire and brimstone API Evangelist, when crafting talks with groups like the Oxford University Press. The Oxford Dictionaries API is easy to get excited about, even though I"m not entirely excited about the areas I'm informing them about like <a href="http://voice.apievangelist.com">voice</a>, <a href="http://bots.apievangelist.com">bots</a>, and machine learning. It is easy to focus on the good that APIs can do at an organizations like Oxford University Press, understanding that they are mission focused, and will be bringing meaningful solutions to the API space, but I would be negligent if I didn't discuss the challenges and dangers of doing APIs.</p>
<p>I want the Oxford Dictionaries API to be successful. I want them to be able to generate revenue so they can keep doing interesting things, and I want them to sensibly do APIs and protect the valuable resources they possess, that they have invested so much time into creating and maintaining. When I recommend that they do APIs, and log every API call being made by applications on behalf of users, I know that they will use this power responsibility and develop awareness&nbsp;around usage, and not exploit their position--something I see from other API providers. The Oxford University Press is a well established, reputable, and mission-driven&nbsp;organization--I want them to be successful on their API journey.</p>
<p>I do not study and evangelize APIs because I think everyone should do APIs. I evangelize APIs to encourage companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies who doing good things to be more successful in what they are already doing, but in a more open, collaborative, and observable way. I evangelize APIs because the cat is out of the bag, and we are already connecting computers, mobile phones, and other devices to the Internet, and it is extremely important that we do it in a secure, yet observable way, that is sustainable for everyone involved--not to just get rich by exploiting 3rd party developers, and the end-users of the applications they build.</p>
<p>I can't make companies do APIs in an ethical way. All I can do is stay up to speed, no..stay ahead of what people are doing, and lead them in the right direction. I am looking to convince, and even trick some of them into being more open and observable with the way they deploy technology, be more open and honest with their business model, and how they think about everyone's privacy and security. Ultimately, I don't want people to do APIs unless it makes sense. I don't think we should be connecting everything to the Internet, however when we do, I want to be here to help companies understand the best practices of doing APIs on the web, and help groups like the Oxford University Press be successful, even though I am perpetually being reminded of the paradox of doing my API Evangelist work.</p>

<p><em>This is from a conversation I had with the Oxford Dictionaries API team last week while in Oxford. I led a conversation with 30-40 folks across several teams at the Oxford University Press offices. I tried to paint a relevant and realistic picture of the world of APIs, as it would pertain to their organization. I talked for about an hour, with another hour of discussion with the group, where we discussed some of these areas in more detail.</em></p>
<p><img style="padding: 12px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/oxford-dictionaries/history-of-apis.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>History of APIs</strong><br />To help connect the dots of where the world of APIs is going I wanted to take a brief walk through the history of APIs and make sure everyone is up to speed. The current wave of web APIs began in early 2000's with SalesForce, Amazon, and eBay leveraging web technologies to deliver commerce related IT services that leverage web technology over traditional enterprise approaches. These early API efforts focused on the integration of CRM, sales, and auction or affiliate related commerce activity, following the first dot-com bubble. Then around 2003, a new type of companies emerged that was employing APIs to connect people online&nbsp;and help them share links, images, and other social content, over the buying and selling of products. Flickr, then Facebook and Twitter emerged as API pioneers, opening up simple web APIs that allowed their communities of developers to integrate, and develop new websites and applications that helped drive the social evolution of the web.</p>
<p>By 2006, API pioneer Amazon had internalized APIs at the commerce giant, requiring internal groups to use them to conduct business internally at the company, something that would result in a new web service for storing information on the web they called Amazon S3. Shortly after they released Amazon S3 they also launched a second API for deploying and managing servers on the Internet, changing how companies can deploy infrastructure for the web--something we now collectively call cloud computing. This is when the web API thing became real for many across the tech sector, as APIs weren't just about commerce or social activities, you could actually deploy global infrastructure using APIs. Cloud computing is something that would transform how we do business on the web, changing how we delivered web applications, but would also bring IT out of the basement of the enterprise, and onto the web to operate in "the cloud"--setting the stage for the next transformation of computing occurring via mobile phones.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 12px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/oxford-dictionaries/bw-web-iphone.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>Web, Mobile, and Beyond</strong><br />Early APIs focused on the syndication&nbsp;of data and content via the web. By 2009, this was changing how we think about computing, something that was greatly aided by the cloud which was put in motion by Amazon's early API efforts. In 2007, Apple introduced their new iPhone to the world, and by 2010 application developers were working hard to develop APIs that could deliver valuable resources to mobile applications, providing what was needed for applications being sold through the Itunes marketplace, and consumed via each wave of smartphones. With the introduction of the Android operating system from Google, the world of computing was clearly no longer just on our desktops, or even via our laptops--our digital bit would now be needed anywhere, in our hands, and via a growing number of Internet-connected devices.</p>
<p>APIs had enabled a whole new approach to delivering resources to mobile applications, as well as allowing these applications to interact with the camera, gyroscope, and other physical features of popular smartphones. This way of thinking about computing would quickly spread to other devices that we would eventually strap to our bodies, install in our homes, cars, and across the landscape of our personal and professional lives. APIs helped deliver content and data to websites, but they were also now driving mobile applications, and now the companies were realizing the potential of connecting sensors, and other devices across a variety of industries, setting the stage for what has become known as the Internet of Things. In 2017, this approach to connect everyday objects to the Internet is helping the Internet penetrate our personal and professional lives, changing how we think from healthcare to transportation. While not all of this connectivity is proving to benefit everyone involved, posing some significant security risks, it is continuing to change how we think about and engage with Internet technology in our lives.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 12px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/oxford-dictionaries/oxford-web-and-api.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>Website + Dev Portal</strong><br />Along this evolution in computing, companies were realizing that APIs weren't just the latest technological trend, and that they were the next iteration of the web, making the web something we just didn't consume, that it was also something that could be programmed, and tailored for each user or&nbsp;device connected to it. Similar to how companies were struggling with the need to have a website during the years between 1995 and 2000, between 2010 and 2015 many companies were realizing that they needed to have their digital resources available via APIs, accessible via a developers portal, where consumers could find what they needed to put valuable data, content, and algorithms to work, adding a wholesale layer to the web. These central portals often live alongside a companies website, changing how a company does business, opening them up to a new way of thinking&nbsp;if the right building blocks were present.</p>
<p>Some companies and startups quickly realized that there was more to all of this than just having APIs. If they also included documentation, code, and other resources, as well as a variety of communication channels and support features, some new and exciting possibilities often emerged. Providing APIs on the web via a rich, informative, and helpful portal would eliminate many of the bottlenecks&nbsp;and polarizing elements that traditional IT operations are often known for. When you opened up your digital assets, made them easily accessible to all stakeholders, and potential consumers, new things were possible, shifting how companies do business, and opening up new opportunities, that might not have occurred behind the corporate firewalls, and the often toxic environments that had developed&nbsp;within the IT environments of previous generations.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 12px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/oxford-dictionaries/api-product-innovation-platform.jpg" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>Innovation &amp; Serendipity</strong><br />API pioneers like SalesForce, Amazon, Twitter, Facebook, and others demonstrated that opening up your digital resources via APIs could enable new and exciting things to occur. In 2006, Twitter launched as a simple website where you could signup, follow people, and "tweet" out messages, six months later they launched the Twitter API and developer portal, and everything else we know as Twitter today was developed by the community. A growing number of technology startups quickly saw that APIs were enabling a new type of innovation, one that allowed 3rd parties to safely and securely use valuable digital resources&nbsp;and develop new web, mobile, and a variety of other integrations and applications. The API approach was fueling innovation that might never have occurred within a company and has the potential to service long tail ideas that teams might not have the time or resources to tackle.</p>
<p>The API approach to doing business was allowing for a form of digital serendipity to enter the picture, allowing for new and beneficial ways of putting digital resources to work. When information has only IT gatekeepers the opportunity for power struggles, and other damaging events to occur, can significantly increase. When there are self-service, yet secure access to resources, complete with identification, logging, and reporting, a much healthier balance to accessing digital resources can often be established. Those of us who are too close to digital resource management are often blinded by the immediate needs of day to day operations, and cannot see the possibilities, or even have the room to breathe and dream about what is possible. More open approaches to web APIs allow for 3rd parties who are free from the operational burdens to ideate, experiment and iterate until they find new applications that can bring some positive change to a platform and it's users.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 12px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/oxford-dictionaries/oxford-partners.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>Internal &amp; Partners</strong><br />While web APIs employ the same technology that the web operates on, and often have publicly available developer portals alongside websites, the APIs aren't always publicly available to everyone. Making corporate resources for use by partners the number one reason companies publish APIs in 2017, providing self-service, often plug and play access to data, content, and algorithms, as well as access to applications developed by 3rd part developers, and even to much-needed developer talent that is available within API ecosystems. An API-first approach allows business groups to quickly get access to the resources they need for partner engagements often without actually having to get the approval of, or wait for IT groups to weigh in, making business development, and the development of projects much more efficient, without the friction, often experienced in the past.</p>
<p>Amazon's experience with APIs gave us the cloud, but the way they internalized APIs within the company has famously given the rest of us a blueprint to use in thinking how API resources are put to work internally. Jeff Bezos, the Amazon CEO, mythically directed all of his employees to use APIs for internal interactions, standardizing how departments shared resources--again, bypassing classic bottlenecks introduced IT organizations. Many of the tools and applications developed on top of an API allow for even non-developers to put resources to work, allowing business groups to do more, with less, bypassing IT, and the need for highly technical talent in many scenarios. APIs are shifting how companies are doing business on the web, engaging with partners, and internally between disparate groups, setting the stage for thinking about different approaches to doing business.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 12px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/oxford-dictionaries/Jigsaw-Puzzle.jpg" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>Modular &amp; Portable</strong><br />The process of API design involves taking often large systems&nbsp;and breaking them up into smaller, more reusable chunks. The process of doing this helps us think through how we define, store, share&nbsp;and put our digital resources to work. Breaking up digital assets into smaller pieces is one of the things that contributes to the innovation, and reuse described previously, allowing individual resources to be put to work, without the dependencies and legacy constraints that are often introduced by their creators and operators. This modularity allows for innovation to occur at the hand of 3rd parties, but also allows for the evolution of individual resources, without having to do major system-wide upgrades, allowing for change to occur in smaller, more management chunks. This modular way of thinking is what has allowed API pioneers like Amazon and SalesForce to dominate and take the lead, as they are able to move much faster than their competition.</p>
<p>The modular way of thinking that APIs can bring to the table has also quickly spread to all parts of the software stack, changing how we deploy databases, our APIs, as well as the applications that are built on top of them. This evolution of API-driven cloud computing has brought us more containerized approaches to deploying and managing resources, as well as helping us develop more modular and portable versions of our applications. This modular approach to delivering architecture has helped concepts like microservices, DevOps, and continuous integration flourishes, allowing for change to occur at a more individual component level, something that is enabling us to deploy infrastructure and applications anywhere, making operations more portable. Through the standardization of containers, APIs, schema, and the other building blocks of the space, we are now able to deploy infrastructure wherever we need, in any cloud, and on any device.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 12px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/oxford-dictionaries/zapier-ipaas.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>Automation &amp; iPaaS</strong><br />It is commonplace to think about 3rd party developers building the web and mobile applications on top of APIs, but it takes more work, imagination, and exploration to understand the potential for automation and integration using a new breed of integration platform as a service (iPaaS) platforms. This is another area that APIs are empowering non-developers to put APIs to work, bypassing IT and the need for more specialized technical talent. This is another area that is proving difficult for many API providers to think about when it comes to what iPaaS providers like Zapier bring to the table, and how to target complementary APIs, process, and workflows that would benefit business operations. Integration is often perceived as a resource intensive, and costly IT project, but this new breed of platforms make integration something anyone can achieve, with projects that can range from a permanent implementation to a solution that is more ephemeral, going away after just a couple of hours, or after a single event occurs.</p>
<p>Most companies encourage developers to make a request for data, content, and algorithmic behavior using their APIs, but the providers who are further along in their API journey don't rely on APIs just being a one-way street, and have begun employing approaches like using webhooks to make API engagement a two-way street. Webhooks allow for other systems to be called via APIs when specific events and circumstances have occurred. The primary need for doing this is to alleviate the number of API calls that developers will have to make on any single API, but the secondary motivation is often about the orchestration and automation using API resources we depend on. Webhooks allow API providers and consumers to automate common business tasks, scheduling them to occur on a regular basis, or being triggered when a specific situation occurs, making the web much more automated and working for whoever is in defining orchestration.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 12px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/oxford-dictionaries/bots.jpg" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>Messaging &amp; Bots</strong><br />APIs are driving development across a variety of business verticals, and one of those sectors that are being changed in some interesting ways is messaging. Enabling users to communicate via a variety of API driven messaging protocols is at the heart of successful platforms like Facebook Twitter&nbsp;and Slack. These API providers are leading discussions when it comes to enabling users to collaborate and communicate&nbsp;while also encouraging developers to get involved using their APIs. An example of the automation described above can be seen in the latest wave of bots to emerge via Facebook messenger, as well as the Slack messaging platform. Bots are small, automated, API-driven scripts that engage with users via messaging platforms, exposing data, content, and algorithms in a conversational format, and hopefully augmenting human interactions in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>Bos are emerging to help users answer common questions, automate tasks, make payments, receive analysis, and many other digital aspects of our professional lives. Slack is leading the charge when it comes to business use cases, but Twitter and Facebook are also fueling the potential of bots when it comes to influencing the news, stock markets, elections, or just providing entertainment by delivering poetry, jokes, or funny pictures and memes. Messaging between humans is not new, and messaging between systems within code is also nothing new, but we are now seeing a convergence of these two worlds fueling human to computer interactions at a scale we haven't' experienced before, with (some) interesting outcomes. Like the&nbsp;web and mobile, bots need APIs to deliver the data and content they need to engage with users&nbsp;and emulate human behavior via this new wave of conversational interfaces.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 12px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/oxford-dictionaries/voice-conversational.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>Voice &amp; Conversational</strong><br />Similar to the messaging bot evolution discussed previously, there is another layer of API driven conversations going on, but this time is leveraging actual voice technologies, allowing humans to talk with the web and other online, API-driven systems. Voice enablement isn't anything new, but with the increased availability of API resources, and the advancement of voice technology like Siri and Alexa, having a conversation with a machine is becoming more common. The latest breed of voice solutions translate voice recordings into text, send that text to a variety of API driven systems, and then translate the response back into a familiar voice that responds to humans via their Internet-connected devices. The availability of cloud resources has significantly contributed to this latest explosion in voice-enablement, making it no surprise that Amazon is leading the charge with their Alexa enabled API ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Voice enablement is another area that API providers, who are further along in their API journey are making their APIs available for, crafting endpoints specifically for use in voice, and studying how end users are putting voice&nbsp;technologies to work at home, in automobiles, and in the workplace. Like iterating API operations for mobile usage, conversational interfaces will require the iteration of API resources, something a modular approach to design will aid considerably. Web APIs have gone a long way to simplifying some often very complex back-end systems, making them more intuitive and usable by end-users. This is something that will help determine which APIs are usable in a conversational environment, requiring APIs to be able to speak more fluently to humans, but it will be a fine balance&nbsp;because in order to scale properly they also need to be machine readable as well.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 12px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/oxford-dictionaries/artificial-intelligence-machine-learning.jpg" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>Artificial Intelligence &amp; Machine Learning</strong><br />Historically, most APIs have been about sending and receiving data or content, with a handful of APIs providing access to more algorithmically focused resources. While these APIs do have data inputs, they are more about applying some sort of computational solution, with data just being the byproduct. This approach to delivering API resources is seeing the significant resurgence with the evolution a growing number of what services that are being labeled Artificial intelligence (AI) or Machine Learning (ML). While the hype around these solutions often exceeds the reality, some of these API resources are providing some very valuable computational resources that can be used in everyday tasks. There are numerous startups emerging to cater to this new wave of Ai and ML solutions, with technology giants like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and even IBM investing heavily so that they can compete.</p>
<p>The artificial intelligence and machine learning APIs often seem magical and mysterious as they operate in a black box, but the solutions they provide range from practical solutions like sentiment analysis and categorization of text, to image transformation, and object or facial recognition in photos. This is just a small subset of what is possible with artificial intelligence and machine learning, with many specialized solutions emerging for using in specific industries like agriculture, policing, or healthcare. APIs are being used to deliver artificial intelligence and machine learning solutions, by wrapping these algorithms in web technology, making them accessible for use in web, mobile, and device applications. In the world of artificial intelligence and machine learning, there is an often missed opportunity by API providers when it comes to augmenting and complementing artificial intelligence and machine learning APIs with other data and content APIs, allowing for much richer, meaningful, and contextually relevant responses.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 12px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/oxford-dictionaries/analysis.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>Analysis &amp; Awareness</strong><br />Using APIs can deliver a heightened level of awareness of a company or organization's digital assets, opening them up in a variety of ways. By employing modern approaches to API management, where all API requests and responses are logged, and all applications and their users are identified, an entirely new level of analysis and surveillance is possible regarding how digital resources are being put to use, or possibly not put to use. Companies who are further along in their API journey have come to realize that in addition to have APIs valuable for business operations, it is valuable to also craft APIs on top of the API operations as well, adding an entirely new dimension to how APIs can be put to use across aa platform. This approach to API deployment has opened up entirely new business models, taking the innovation explored earlier to new levels, driving home the opportunity for serendipity to occur across operations.</p>
<p>This newfound awareness (sometimes turning to surveillance) across operations is the number one benefit of doing APIs. Going API-first helps map out digital resources while making them more accessible, and reusable, and when reporting is properly applied across the logging that is common across API operations, the analysis opportunities can be just as compelling as the core APIs themselves. Understanding how resources are used, what is of most interest to users, and what types of applications are making the biggest impact rise to the top. Because this layer is API driven as well, the same approach to integration, iteration and innovation can occur as other areas of the ecosystem. This layer API access should be carefully controlled, and may or may not be available to the public, and often only available internally, or to a select group of partners, making the analysis and awareness much more guarded, so that it protects the privacy and security of end-users, as well as platform operators and developers.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 12px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/oxford-dictionaries/visualization.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>Visualizations &amp; Embeddable</strong><br />Whether it's directly from core API resources, or the operational level of APIs, building off the modular and portable approach available with modern API architecture, one of the most valuable applications within an ecosystem is centered around the ability to visualize, and deliver embedding solutions on the web, mobile, in emails, and other applications. A dashboard is a common way to look at this, or possibly API-riven infographics, but the savviest API providers are developing a wealth of API embeddable that leverage open source solutions such as D3.js to make everything visual and embeddable. When this approach accompanies a branding strategy, it can extend the value of the platform beyond the domain, extending the reach of the ecosystem. While often centered around more visual elements of the platform, embeddable tools can also be more functional and interactive, bringing another dimension of benefit to operations.</p>
<p>Embeddable tooling comes in all shapes and sizes, with the best solutions adhering to web standards, and leaving proprietary approaches behind the firewall. The most well-known examples of this in action can be found with Twitter and Facebook share buttons, or with the Youtube video player which extends the video platform on sites across the web. Embeddables do not have to be developed by the platform alone and can become a community effort, showcasing simple, copy and pastable solutions crafted by an APIs developer within the ecosystem. The first layer of API-driven embeddable should speak to the value delivered by core APIs, with the second layer of embeddable taking advantage of the programmable web, and making the experience more interactive for consumers, generating content, and data--bringing value to the platform that can contribute to the analysis and awareness layer of API operations discussed previously.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 12px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/oxford-dictionaries/bw-storytelling.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>Evangelism &amp; Storytelling</strong><br />APIs begin with a technological seed but they need to make an impact at the human level if they are to find success, making the single most important tool in the toolbox storytelling, advocacy, and evangelism around what an API does. If people do not know an API exists, or what is possible with, none of this matters. API operations often suffer from the same search engine optimization (SEO) challenges that regular website efforts do. For an API to stand out and be found on the web it takes a great deal of work telling stories about API operations, and the applications that are being build on top of them. This storytelling needs to be included as part of existing marketing strategies, but will also require a special touch for it to pass the inspection of an often very picky developer community, who tend to be a slightly different beast when it comes to getting the attention of, and keep&nbsp;them engaged.</p>
<p>Storytelling and evangelism have to be genuine. It has to speak to the value an API brings to the table, and reflect the solutions that developers and integrators will be looking to provide. This outreach isn't just a public effort, it should include public consumers, as well as partners, and internal users. Ideally, API outreach has a dedicated team that can craft a message that speaks to the platform, but also respond to support operations, and be intimately aware of what is happening within the ecosystem, establishing and maintaining a deep relationship with the community. If outreach is going to be effective, it has to be relevant to the operations, match the technical and other support challenges that developers are facing--possessing strong context for the community. Finding a voice, establishing, and maintaining a true presence for an API is the number challenge I see API platform's struggle with, and is the number one contributor to their demise.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 12px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/talks/oxford-dictionaries/google-ubicomp.jpg" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>Establishing a Presence</strong><br />There are thousands of public APIs available on the web, a number that is only growing, so standing out takes a significant amount of work. 75% of the API providers I encounter suffer from the "build it and they will come" disease, and think developers will just find them, and understand the value an API delivers. This is why you see a handful of blog posts on many APIs, a couple months of Tweets, and then radio silence. The successful APIs out there have sustained operations, with robust storytelling, evangelism and outreach both on and offline. This goes for APIs that aren't 100% public too. If you want to reach partners, or even make internal groups aware across large, and often global organizations, evangelism is essential. Establishing a presence is not a one time thing, it take months, and years to do properly, and will require constant investment and maintenance.</p>
<p>The most efficient way to establish a presence is by being transparent and observable in everything you do. Adding new features to the road map? Publish them online, blog and tweet about them. Get the community involved. Ask for feedback, follow and retweet your users. Get to know them on the platforms and in the channels they already exist on. Be a regular presence, but not one that is always preaching and selling. Make sure you listen, study, and understand your target audience, and speak to what they'll need. Even when a developer does learn about an API there is no guarantees they will have an immediately pressing need and put it to use right away. A fine tuned API presence will ensure that potential consumers are aware that an API exists, and is constantly being reminded that it exists by blogging, Tweeting, storytelling, outreach, and engagement--when done properly developers will know where to go when they have a problem to solve.</p>

<p><strong>Repeat, Repeat, Repeat</strong><br />I have been doing API Evangelist for seven years this summer. Success has been difficult. It has taken a regular drumbeat to stand out in the crowd. It has required some difficult decisions regarding who I partner with, and give access to my resources and brand so that I maintain my desired level of trust amongst my consumers. While I'm not evangelizing a single API, I am helping cultivate the awareness of a variety of APIs, as well as the best practices across these API operations--the process is the same for individual API providers. Often times I'm repeating what I have written before, and giving similar talks at conferences, meetups, and presentations like this. However, I am always iterating and evolving based on feedback I receive, and how my work is applied (or not), something that can be very painful to move forward on some days. The creativity doesn't always come right away, and sometimes I have to just to maintenance work just to keep busy, and come back to my storytelling when it feels right.</p>
<p>The most important part of what I'm doing is that I'm consistently out there, telling stories online, and in person. Early on in my presence, it was critical for me to be at public events shaking hands&nbsp;and making the in-person connections. After three years of doing a majority of in-person events I'm able to do more of it online, than I do offline, but I still have to be blogging, tweeting, and committing regularly. This is how I've established the presence that I have, and made the connection with people that I have. When someone is ready to do APIs or ready for the next step in their API operations, they know where to find me, and the resources that I provide. This is the core of any API operation, my world is no different than yours. I guarantee I have way less budget, and time than you, but somehow I've found a way to keep going. I have also had several times where I faced burnout, but I find if I just keep pushing forward, creating, writing, developing, and iterating I get through it--the solution is always repeat, repeat, and repeat&nbsp;until I find the right path forward.</p>

<p><em>While this talk was designed just for my conversation with the Oxford University Press team, it is generic enough for any other company to consider, and use to learn about the API space. I worked pretty hard to keep it a pretty positive view of the API landscape, and left most of the realities of this world for the in-person conversation, but is also something I'll cover in future posts this week. Honestly, when working with organizations like the Oxford University Press, I am left pretty optimistic about this whole API thing--something that is increasingly difficult with some of the ways that I am seeing APIs be wielded in 2017.</em></p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Apr 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://guides.github.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/github_guides.png" alt="" width="50%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I have had a number of requests from folks lately to write more about Github, and how they can use the social coding platform as part of their API operations. As I work with more companies outside of the startup echo chamber on their API strategies I am encountering more groups that aren't Github fluent&nbsp;and could use some help getting started. It has also been a while since I've thought deeply about how API providers should be using Github&nbsp;so it will allow me to craft some fresh content on the subject.</p>
<p><strong>Github As Your Technical Social Network</strong><br />Think of Github as a more technical version of Facebook, but instead of the social interactions being centered around wall posts, news links, photos, and videos, it is focused on engagement with repositories. A repository is basically a file folder that you can make public or private, and put anything you want into it. While code is the most common thing put into Github repositories, they often contain data file, presentations, and other content, providing a beneficial way to manage many aspects of API operations.</p>
<p><strong>The Github Basics</strong><br />When putting Github to use as part of your API operations, start small. Get your profile setup, define your organization, and begin using it to manage documentation or other simple areas of your operations--until you get the hang of it. Set aside any pre-conceived notions about Github being about code, and focus on the handful of services it offers to enable your API operations.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Users </strong>- Just like other online services, Github has the notion of a user, where you provide a photo, description, and other relevant details about yourself. Avoid making a user accounts for your API, making sure you show the humans involved in API operations. It does make sense to have a testing, or other generic platform Github users accounts, but make sure your API team each have their own user profile, providing a snapshot of everyone involved. &nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Organizations -</strong> You can use Github organizations to group your API operations under a single umbrella. Each organization has a name, logo, and description, and then you can add specific users as collaborators, and build your team under a single organization. Start with a single repository for your entire API operations, then you can consider the additional organization to further organize your efforts such as partner programs, or other aspects of internal API operations.</li>
<li><strong>Repositories -</strong> A repository is just a folder. You can create a repository, and replicate (check out) a repository using the Github desktop client, and manage its content locally, and commit changes back to Github whenever you are ready. Repositories are designed for collaborative, version controlled engagements, allowing for many people to work together, while still providing centralized governance and control by the designated gatekeeper for whatever project being managed via a repository--the most common usage is for managing open source software.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/blog/2309-introducing-topics">Topics</a> -</strong> Recently Github added the ability to label your repositories using what they call topics. Topics are used as part of Github discovery, allowing users to search using common topics, as well as searching for users, organizations, and repositories by keyword. Github Topics is providing another way for developers to find interesting APIs using search, browsing, and <a href="https://github.com/trending">Github trends</a>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://gist.github.com/">Gists</a></strong> - A GitHub service for managing code snippets that allow them to be embedded in other websites, documentation -- great for use in blog posts, and communication around API operations.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://pages.github.com/">Pages</a></strong> - Use Github Pages for your project websites. It is the quickest way to stand up a web page to host API documentation, code samples, or the entire portal for your API effort.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/">API</a> - </strong>Everything on the Github platform is available through the Github API. Making all aspects of your API operations available via an API, which is the way it should be.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Managing API Operations With Github</strong><br />There are a handful of ways I encourage API providers to consider using Github as part of their operations. I prefer to use Github for all aspects of API operations, but not every organization is ready for that--I encourage you to focus in these areas when you are just getting going:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Developer Portal -</strong> You can use Github Pages to host your API developer portal--I recommend taking a look at <a href="http://portal.minimum.apievangelist.com/">my minimum viable API portal definition</a> to see an example of this in action.</li>
<li><strong>Documentation</strong> - Whether as part of the entire portal or just as a single repository, it is common for API providers to publish API documentation to Github. <a href="https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc">Using solutions like ReDoc</a>, it is easy to make your API documentation look good, while also easily keeping them up to date.</li>
<li><strong>Code Samples w/ </strong>Gists<strong>&nbsp;-</strong> It is easy to manage all samples for an API using Github Gists, allowing them to be embedded in the documentation, and other communication and storytelling conducted as part of platform operations.</li>
<li><strong>Software Development Kits (SDK) Repositories -</strong> If you are providing complete SDKs for API integrations in a variety of languages you should be using Github to manage their existence, allowing API consumers to fork and integrate as they need, while also staying in tune with changes.</li>
<li><strong>OpenAPI Management </strong>- Publish your <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> or <a href="https://www.openapis.org/">OpenAPI</a> definition to Github, allowing the YAML or JSON to be versioned, and managed in a collaborate environment where API consumers can fork and integrate into their own operations.</li>
<li><strong>Issues</strong> - Use <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/issues/">Github issues</a> for managing the conversation around integration and operational issues.</li>
<li><strong>Road Map</strong> - Also use <strong>Github Issues</strong> to help aggregate, collaborate, and evolve the road map for API operations, encouraging consumers to be involved.</li>
<li><strong>Change Log</strong> - When anything on the roadmap is achieved flag it for inclusion in the change log, providing a list of changes to the platform that API consumers can use as a reference.</li>
</ul>
<p>Github is essential to API operations. There is no requirement for Github users to possess developer skills. Many types of users put Github to use in managing the technical aspects of projects&nbsp;to take advantage of the network effect, as well as the version control and collaboration introduced by the social platform. It's common for non-technical folks to be intimidated by Github, ad developers often encourage this, but in reality, Github is as easy to use as any other social network--it just takes some&nbsp;time to get used to and familiar it.</p>
<p>If you have questions about how to use Github, feel free to reach out. I'm happy to focus on specific uses of Github for API operations in more detail. I have numerous examples of how it can be used, I just need to know where I should be focusing next. Remember, there are no stupid questions. I am an advocate for everyone taking advantage of Github&nbsp;and I fully understand that it can be difficult to understand how it works when you are just getting going.&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">31 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://scenarios.stoplight.io/spec-editor"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2017_03_31_at_2.40.15_pm.png" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm keeping an eye on the different approaches by API service providers when it comes to providing API editors within their services and tooling. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/03/06/please-develop-an-embeddable-open-source-visual-api-editor/">While I wish there was an open source GUI API editor out there</a>, the closest thing we have is from these API service providers, and I am trying to track on what the best practices are so that when someone does step up and begin working on an open, embeddable solution, they can learn from my stories about what is working or not working across the space.</p>
<p>One example I think has characteristics that should be emulated is <a href="https://scenarios.stoplight.io/spec-editor">the API Spec Editor from Stoplight</a>. The GUI editor lets you manage all the core elements of an OpenAPI like the general info, host, paths, and even the shared responses and parameters. They even provide what they call a CRUD builder where you paste the JSON schema, and they'll generate the common paths you will need to create, read, update, and delete your resources. Along the way you can also make calls to API endpoints using their interactive interface, helping ensure your API definition is actually in alignment with your API.</p>
<p>The Stoplight API Spec Editor bridges the process of defining your OpenAPI for your operations, with actually documenting and engaging with an API through an interactive client interface. I like this approach to coming at API design from multiple directions. Apiary first taught us that API definitions were about more than just documentation, and I think our API editors should keeping evolving on this concept, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/03/29/helping-your-customers-operate-throughout-the-api-life-cycle/">allowing us to engage with any stops along the API life cycle&nbsp;like we are seeing from API service providers like Restlet</a>.</p>
<p>I'm already keeping an eye on Restlet and APIMATIC's approach to providing a GUI API design editor within their solutions&nbsp;and will keep an eye out on other providers as I have time. Like other areas of the API sector, I'm hoping I can develop a list of best practices that any service provider can follow when developing their tools and services.</p>

<p>I'm endlessly fascinated by APIs&nbsp;and enjoy studying their evolution. One of the challenges in helping evangelize APIs that I come across regularly is the many different views of what is or isn't an API amongst people who are API literate, as well as helping bring APIs into focus for the API newcomers&nbsp;because there are so many possibilities. Out of the two, I'd say that dealing with API dogma is by far a bigger challenge, than explaining APIs to newbies--dogma can be very poisonous to productive conversations and end up working against everyone involved in my opinion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm enjoying reading about the evolution in the API space when it comes to GraphQL and gRPC. There are a number of very interesting implementations, services, tooling, and implementations emerging in both these areas. However, I do see similar mistakes being made regarding dogmatic behavior, aggressive marketing tactics, and shaming folks for doing things differently, as I've seen with REST, Hypermedia, and linked data efforts. I know folks are passionate about what they are doing, and truly believe their way is right, but I'm concerned you will all suffer from the same deficiencies&nbsp;in adoption I've seen with previous implementations.</p>
<p>I started API Evangelist with the mission of counteracting the aggressive approach of the RESTafarians. I've spent a great deal of time thinking about how I can turn average developers and even business folks on to the concept of APIs--no not just REST or just hypermedia, but web APIs in general. Something that I now feel includes GraphQL and gRPC. I've seen many hardworking folks invest a lot into their APIs, only to have them torn apart by API techbros (TM) who think they've done it wrong--not giving a rats ass regarding the need to actually help someone understand the pros and cons of each approach.</p>
<p>I'm confident that GraphQL will find its place&nbsp;in the API toolbox, and enjoy significant adoption when it comes to data-intensive&nbsp;API implementations. However, I'd say 75% of the posts I read are pitting GraphQL against REST, stating it is a better solution. Period. No mention of its limitations or use cases where it might not be a good idea. Leaving us to only find out about these from the GraphQL haters--playing out the exact same production we've seen over the last five years with REST v Hypermedia. Hypermedia is finding its place in some very useful API implementations like FoxyCart, and AWS API Gateway (to name just a few), but its growth has definitely suffered from this type of storytelling, and I fear that GraphQL will face a similar fate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This problem is not a technical challenge. It is a storytelling and communication&nbsp;challenge, bundled with some very narrow incentive models fueled by a male-dominated startup culture, where folks really, really like being right and making others feel bad for not being right. Stop it. You aren't helping your cause. Even if you do get all your techbros thinking like you do, your tactics will fail in the mainstream business world, and you will only give more ammo to your haters, and further confuse your would be consumers, adopters, and practitioners. You will have a lot more success if you are empathetic towards your readers, and produce content that educates, and empowers, over shames and tearing down.</p>
<p>I'm writing this because I want my readers to understand the benefits of GraphQL, and I don't want gRPC evangelists to make the same mistake. It has taken waaaay too long for linked data efforts to recover, and before you say it isn't a thing, it has made a significant comeback in SEO circles, because of Google's adoption of JSON-LD, and a handful of SEO evangelists spreading the gospel in a friendly and accessible way--not because of linked data people (they tend to be dicks in my experience). As I've said before, we should be investing in a robust API toolbox, and we should be helping people understand that benefits of different approaches, and learn about the successful implementations. Please learn from others mistakes in the sector, and help see meaningful growth across all viable approaches to doing API--thanks.</p>

        <span class="post-date">30 Mar 2017</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2017_03_30_at_6.48.27_pm.png" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p><a href="https://blog.runscope.com/posts/using-google-sheets-and-runscope-to-run-api-tests-with-multiple-variable-sets">The Runscope team recently published a post on a pretty cool approach to using Google Sheets for running API tests with multiple variable sets</a>, which I thought is valuable at a couple of levels. They provide <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B8iTvriTfCbvUIe0mvc7dbNInYanaQn_00LvWHVZn8E/edit#gid=0">a template Google Sheet for anyone to follow, where you can plug in your variable, as well as your Runscope API Key, which allows you to define the dimensions of the tests you wish to push to Runscope via their own API.</a></p>
<p>The first thing that grabs me about this approach is how Runscope is allowing their customers to define and expand the dimensions of how they test their API using Runscope in a way that will speak to a wider audience, beyond just the usual API developer audience. Doing this in a spreadsheet allows Runscope customers to customize their API tests for exactly the scenarios they need, without Runscope having to customize and respond to each individual customer's needs--providing a nice balance.</p>
<p>The second thing that interests me about their approach is the usage of a Googe Sheet as a template for making API calls, whether you are testing your APIs, or any other scenario an API enables. This type of templating of API calls opens up the API client to a much wider audience, making integration copy and pastable, shareable, collaborative, and something anyone can reverse engineer and learn about the surface area of an API--in this scenario, it just happens to be the surface area of Runscope's API testing API.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/03/23/sharing-api-data-validation-examples/">Runscope's approach is alignment with my previous post about sharing data validation examples</a>. A set of assertions could be defined within a spreadsheets and any stakeholder could use the spreadsheet to execute and make sure the assertions are met. This would have huge implications for the average business user to help make sure API contracts are meeting business objectives. I'm considering using this approach to empower cities, counties, and states to test and validate human services API implementations as part of my <a href="http://openreferral.org">Open Referral</a> work.</p>
<p>It told John Sheehan, the CEO of Runscope that their approach was pretty creative, and he said that "Google sheets scripts are underrated" and that Google Sheets is the "API client for the everyperson". I agree. I'd like to see more spreadsheet templates like this used across the API life cycle when it comes to design, deployment, management, testing, monitoring, and every other area of API operations. I'd also like to see more spreadsheet templates available for making calls to other common APIs, making APIs accessible to a much wider audience, who are familiar with spreadsheets, and more likely to be closer to the actual problems in which API solutions are designed to solve.</p>

        <span class="post-date">30 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2017_03_30_at_3.12.32_pm.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>Many API providers I meet have the "build it and they will come" mentality, thinking that if they build an API, developers will come and use it. It does happen, but many APIs only have so many direct uses, and will have a limited number of resulting implementations. This is one of the reasons I recommend companies do APIs in the first place, to get beyond the obvious and direct implementations, and incentivize entirely new applications that a provider may not have considered.</p>
<p>Developing innovative applications an API provider may not have considered is the primary focus of companies I talk to, but only a handful have begun thinking about the other APIs that are out there that might compliment an API. An example of this is with my friends over at the <a href="https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com/">Oxford Dictionary APIs</a>, where building applicaitons with built-in dictionaries is pretty obvious. However, the complimentary API partnering and usage might not be as obvious, something I'm encouraging their team to think more about.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com/">What are some examples of complimentary APIs for the Oxford Dictionaries API</a>?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API Design - </strong>This example is more meta API, than complimentary API, but <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/03/29/learning-to-use-our-words-better-when-defining-our-apis/">I'd like to see more API design tooling to begin to use dictionaries as part of their GUI and IDE interfaces</a>. Providing more structure to the way we design our APIs, helping ensure that the design of leading APIs are more intuitive, and coherent--achieving a less technical interface, and something that speaks to humans.</li>
<li><strong>Machine Learning -</strong> I'm using a number of machine learning APIs to accomplish a variety of business tasks from object recognition in images, to text and language pattern recognition in content I produce or curate. There are a number of opportunities to extend the responses I get back from these APIs using a dictionary, helping increase the reach of the machine learning services I employ, and making them more effective and meaningful in my business operations.</li>
<li><strong>Search -</strong> I use the <a href="https://www.algolia.com/doc/rest-api/search/">Algolia API</a> to build a variety of search indexes for the API space, helping me curate and recall a variety of information that I track on as part of my API monitoring. I'm considering building a augmented synonym layer tha thelps me search for terms, then expand those searches based upon suggestions from the Oxford Dictionaries API. I'm looking to augment and enrich the Algolia search capabilities with the suggestions from the dictionary API, expanding beyond any single key word or phrase I identify relevant to any industry or topic being served by the API sector.</li>
<li><strong>Bots</strong> - If you are going to build convincing bots using the Slack or Facebook APIs you will need a robust vocabulary to work with. You won't just need a single downloaded and stored dictionary, you will need one like the Oxford Dictionaries API that evolves and changes with the world around us to enrich your bot's presence.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Voice</strong> - Similar to bots, if you are going to deliver a robust voice interface via Alexa, or other voice enabled platform, you will need a rich dictionary to work from. Similar to how I'm expanding and enriching the other suggestions listed above, a dictionary layer will expand on how you will be able to interpret the text that is derived from each voice interface engagement.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a couple examples of how one API could provide complimentary features to other APIs out there. It is important for API providers to be reaching out to other API providers and their communities when evangelizing their own APIs. Sure, you should be incentivizing developers to build applications on top of your APIs, but your definition of "application" should include other APIs that your resources compliment, and enrich the solutions being developed on top their platforms.</p>
<p>For a space where integration and interoperability appears to be priority number one, the API sector is notoriously closed, and many API providers I meet have their blinders on. As an API provider you should always be studying the rest of the API sector, looking for good examples to follow, as well as bad examples to avoid--similar to what I do as the API Evangelist. Along this journey you should also be looking for complimentary APIs to your platform, and vice versa. Think of SendGrid and Twilio as an example--email, SMS, and voice all go together very well, and their communities significantly overlap, providing the makings for a ripe partnership.</p>
<p>What are a couple of existing APIs that your APIs complement? This is your homework assignment for the week! ;-)</p>

I know folks are obsessed with <a href="http://voice.apievangelist.com">voice</a>, <a href="http://bot.apievangelist.com">bot</a>, and other conversational interfaces, but I agree with Slack, that there is a huge opportunity to help users execute common API-driven functions with a single push of a button. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/10/26/asynchonous-conversational-interfaces-for-us-anti-social-folks/">It is something I blog about regularly</a>, helping folks realize the opportunity in the development of API driven, embeddable buttons, that go beyond what Slack is doing and would run anywhere on the web, in the browser, or even on mobile and other Internet connected devices.</p>

However, what I am thinking about should be even easier, embeddable anywhere, and leverage the web technology already in use (forms, inputs, GET, POST, etc.). If in a browser it should work like bookmarklets, and if it exists within the pages of a website or application, it should work as some simple copy/paste HTML with minimum JS when necessary to avoid blockage by ad blockers and other privacy protection tooling.</p>
<p>I understand that it is easy to follow the pack when it comes to the latest technology trends, and I'm sure voice and bots will gain some mindshare when it comes to conversational interfaces. However, sometimes we just need the easy button for those high-frequency tasks that quietly devour our time, as Slack puts it. As I <a href="https://developers.google.com/schemas/formats/json-ld">see JSON-LD embedeed into more web pages</a>, further pleasing the Google search algorithm, there would also be more semantic opportunities for browser buttons to engage with the data and content within web pages in a more meaningful, and context aware way.</p>
<p>API driven buttons and similiar <a href="http://embeddable.apievangelist.com">embeddables</a> and browser tooling is such an interesting opportunity that I would tackle myself, but I'm so resistant to anything that might take me away from my work as the API Evangelist, which is why I'm putting it out here publicly. I will put more time into some single use button examples that might start the conversation for some, but I recommend taking a look at what Slack and Zapier have done to get started. As the pace of technology continues it's blind march forward at the request of VCs, I'm confident that there is huge opportunity for simple solutions like buttons to make a significant impact--let me know if you'd like to know more.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/oxford_dictionaries_api_home_screenshot.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com">I am playing around with the Open API for the Oxford Dictionaries API</a>, and I'm struck by the importance of not just dictionaries like the Oxford Dictionaries, but also the importance of OpenAPI, and API providers defining their APIs like the Oxford folks have. While we aren't as far down the road as we are with the English dictionary, we are beginning to make progress when it comes to defining the paths, parameters, and other characteristics using OpenAPI, learning to speak and communicate in the digital world using APIs.</p>
<p>We use words to craft titles, paragraphs, outlines, and other ways that we communicatie in our personal and professional lives. We also use words to craft titles, paragraphs, outlines, collections, and other ways our systems our communicating in our personal and professional lives using the OpenAPI specification. In both these forms of communicating we are always trying to find just the right words, or series and orders of words to get across exactly the meaning we are looking for--we just have centuries of doing this when it comes writing and speaking, and only a decade or so of doing this with defining our digital resources using APIs.</p>
<p>Eventually, I'd like to see entire dictionaries of <a href="http://json-schema.org/">JSON Schema</a>, <a href="http://alps.io/">ALPS</a>, or other machine readable specification, available by industry, and topic. The way we craft our API definitions and design our APIs often feels like we have barely learned to speak, let alone read or write. I'd like to see more reuse of common dictionaries already in use by leading API providers, and I'd like to see us get more thoughtful in how we express ourselves via our API definitions.  The most successful APIs I find out there don't just provide a machine readable interface, they provide an intuitive interface that makes sense to humans, while also being machine readable for use in other systems.</p>
<p>It feels like to me that we should integrating the <a href="https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com/">Oxford Dictionaries API</a> into our API design tooling, letting us suggest, autocomplete, and discover better ways to articulate the meaning behind our APIs. <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/tools/design-editors/">API design editors</a> could use the Oxford Dictionaries API to help developers attach more precise meaning to the names of paths, parameters, and other aspects of defining our APIs, much like word processors have done for the last couple of decades. Most APIs I come across do not have any sort of coherent name, ordering, or structure, and the few that have deployed an OpenAPI or other machine readable format, often feel like cave writing, and lack any coherent structure, purpose, or meaning--we have a long, long way to go before our systems learn to communicate even at a 1st grade level.</p>

<p>When I started API Evangelist back in 2010 the only stop along the API life cycle that service providers were talking about was API management. In 2017, there are numerous stops along the API life cycle from design, to testing, all the way to deprecation. The leading API providers are expanding the number of stops they service, and the smart ones are making sure that if they only service on or two stops, they do so by providing via API definitions like OpenAPI, ensuring their customers are able to seamlessly weave multiple service providers together to address their full life cycle of needs.</p>
<p><a href="http://restlet.com">I've been working with my partner Restlet to advise them on expanding their platform to be what I consider to be an API life cycle provider</a>. When I first was introduced to Restlet they were the original open source enterprise grade API deployment framework. Then Restlet became a cloud API deployment and management provider, and with their acquisition of DHC they also became an API client, and testing provider. Now with their latest update, they have worked hard to help their developer and business customers service almost every stop along a modern API life cycle, from design to deprecation.</p>
<p>While Restlet is developing tooling to help companies define what the API life cycle means to them, the heartbeat of what Restlet delivers centers around API definitions like OpenAPI and RAML. API definitions provide the framework when your designing, deploying, documenting, managing, and testing your APIs using Restlet. They also provide the ability for you to get your API definitions in and out of the platform, and load them into potentially other API services, allow API operators to get what they need done. In my opinion, making API definitions just as importan tas any other service or tooling you offer along the API life cycle.</p>
<p>Serving a single or handful of stops along the API life cycle can be today's version of vendor lockin. If your customers cannot easily load their API definitions in and out of your system you are locking them in, and while they may stay with you for a while, eventually they will need additional services, and the extra work it takes to keep in sync with your platform will increase, and eventually it won't be worth staying. I'm a big fan of companies doing one thing and doing it well, servicing single stops along the API life cycle, but after watching companies come and go for the last seven years, the one's that don't support API definitions won't be around too long.</p>

<p>I was playing around with, and better understanding <a href="https://glitch.com/">the new collaborative developer community that is Glitch</a>, and <a href="https://medium.com/glitch/how-we-wont-screw-up-glitch-9b46fe153157">I saw they had published a blog post about how they won't screw up Glitch</a>. The topic was in alignment with another post I was working on regarding what I'd like to see fro API startups, but I think Anil articulates it better than even I could, and I think folks are going to respect it a lot more when it comes from a seasoned veteran like him, over an opinionated evangelist like me.</p>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/glitch/how-we-wont-screw-up-glitch-9b46fe153157">In hist post, Anil shares five key points I think every startup should be thinking about from day one</a>:</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li id="315c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong><span class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">No lock-in.&nbsp;</span></strong>We use totally standard infrastructure for Glitch, including regular old Node.js, and normal JavaScript for your code. You can export all of your code to GitHub with a click, or download a zip file of your code instantly at any time. And it&rsquo;s gonna stay that way. The key thing that we think will keep you using Glitch is by your deep emotional connection to your fellow members of the community. And that&rsquo;s not lock-in, that&rsquo;s love! Aww.</li>
<li id="c432" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong><span class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">We&rsquo;re not gonna take features away from you and then start charging for them</span>.</strong> This is one of those tricky things that a lot of companies do when they start building a business model for their product &mdash; they ask, &ldquo;what would people pay for?&rdquo; And then they realize&hellip; oh crap, the stuff people want to pay for is already offered for free. We&rsquo;ve thought about this pretty carefully so we&rsquo;ll be able to support our current features going forward. (It doesn&rsquo;t cost much for us to run your Glitch app, and that cost is going down each month. No biggie.)</li>
<li id="50ed" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><span class="markup--strong markup--li-strong"><strong>When we do start charging for stuff, we&rsquo;ll check with you first</strong>.&nbsp;</span>We imagine we&rsquo;ll add some paid features on top of what Glitch has now (maybe domain names?&nbsp;<span class="markup--quote markup--li-quote is-other">Everybody loves mapping domain names!)</span>&nbsp;and when we do, we&rsquo;ll let you know they&rsquo;re coming, plus get your feedback on what you think is fair and reasonable pricing. Because we want you to be happy to pay for these valuable features!</li>
<li id="a1df" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong><span class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">We won&rsquo;t let a bunch of jerks take over the community.&nbsp;</span></strong>Ugh, this one is so annoying. Usually, when a company is trying to grow a community, they&rsquo;ll let just about anybody in because they&rsquo;re desperate to show growth, and that inevitably means opening the door to some small number of jerks, who then ruin the whole site for everybody. Instead of doing that foolish thing, we&rsquo;re going to grow Glitch steadily and deliberately, with tons of room for new folks, but a lot of thought put into preventing abuse and harassment. I can&rsquo;t guarantee we&rsquo;ll get it perfect, but honestly the thought of working every day to build something that&rsquo;s mostly used by jerks would be awful, so we&rsquo;re not gonna do it. And honestly, Glitch is growing pretty quickly because it&rsquo;s friendly, so hooray for nice people.</li>
<li id="acd1" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong><span class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">We want your fun and weird and &ldquo;not serious&rdquo; stuff on Glitch, too.&nbsp;</span></strong>While we&rsquo;re ecstatic to feature Serious Tools from incredible companies like Slack on Glitch, we think your artsy or silly or deeply personal projects are vital to the community, too. The same people who spend their day building a complex API integration on top of Glitch&rsquo;s tools will come home and collaborate on a generative poetry project at night, and that&rsquo;s exactly what we&rsquo;re designing for. So don&rsquo;t feel embarrassed to show all your many facets here; that&rsquo;s what our own team does, too.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are other things I'd like to see other startups focus on like privacy and security, but Anil really get's at athe heart of much of the illness we see regarding API startups. For me, it really comes down to communication and honesty about the business model, which Anil talks about in a very approachable way. I don't expect companies who are doing startups to do everything that us developers want, but I do want you to be open, honest, and communicative with us about what is going on--that is all.</p>
<p>I fully grasp that startups are in the business of making money, and often have different motivations than many (some) of us developers who are consuming their API focused resources. I do not expect these things to always be in perfect balance, but I do expect startups to be honest with developers from day one, and not bullshit us about their business model, changes and the long term road map. I appreciate that Anil and the Glitch team has started things off on this foot, hopefully providing the rest of us with a model to follow when it comes to not screwing over your developer community, and building more trust when it comes to depending on APIs across the sector.</p>
<p>I am looking forwarding to <a href="https://glitch.com/">learning more about Glitch</a>, and the potential for the community.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Mar 2017</span>
        <p>Building a business is hard. Building a business that depends on other business is hard. We would like it if all of our vendors stuck around forever, but this is not the reality of doing business in today's climate. My stance on this situation that nothing lasts forever, but startups and the enterprise could be more honest about the business of startups, which is seriously beginning to impact the trust we all have in the platforms, tools, and APIs we depend on for our businesses.</p>
<p>I was working my way through some legacy tweets, and <a href="https://twitter.com/ParseIt">I came across Parse's Twitter home page</a>, which I think sums up the promise being made by each wave of startups, and the end results of these promises--although I have to say that Parse actually handled it pretty well, compared with other startups that I have seen in action.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/parse_building_apps_isnt_easy_shut_down.png" alt="" width="95%" /></p>
<p>Building apps is not easy. However, we need solutions that will get us all the way there. I actually think that in the end, Parse handled it pretty well, better than StackMob did, when Paypal bought them. In the end, you could take the open source version of Parse and install it, and they communicated the deprecation pretty well, giving folks quite a bit of time to take care of business. However, this is the way it should be from day one. There should be APIs, and open source available to ease operation and migration--as well as communication about what the future will hold.</p>
<p>If API focused startups don't start being more honest about their true business strategy, and the realities of the future from day one, fewer developers and users will buy what is being sold. Sure, there will always be new waves of young developers who will still believe, but the more experienced folks, who are often in charge of making purchasing decisions, will become increasingly skeptical about baking in APIs into their operations--screwing this up for the rest of us trying to actually make a living, and not just get rich.</p>

<p>There are a number of things at work making this whole web API thing actually work. One of them that came up while I was at Google discussing APIs a couple weeks ago, while we were listening to Dan Ciruli (<a href="https://twitter.com/danciruli">@danciruli</a>) was the importance of being able to see an API request in the browser. It is something I think we often overlook when it comes to understanding why web APIs have reached such a wide audience.</p>
<p>I remember when I first realized I could change the URL in my Delicious account and get an XML listing of my bookmarks--this is when the API light first went on in my head. The web wasn't just for humans, it could be structured for use in other websites. Seeing the XML in the browser presented me links in a machine readable way, that triggered me to think about else I could with them, and which other systems I could put them to work in.</p>
<p>Being able to see the results of an API call in the browser helps stimulate the imagination when it comes to what is possible. This is similar to why API client tooling like <a href="http://getpostman.com/">Postman</a> and <a href="https://client.restlet.com/">Restlet Client</a> are popular with developers--they help us see the possibilities. While not all APIs are simple enough to allow for viewing in the browser, when at all possible, we should keep things this easy, because you never know when it will make a mark, and help folks better understand what is going on under the hood, allowing them to put our APIs to work in ways we never expected.</p>

<p class="p1"><em>This is an article from the current edition of the&nbsp;<a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/guide/">API Evangelist industry guide to API definitions</a>. The guide is designed to be a summary of the world of API definitions, providing the reader with a recent summary of the variety of specifications that are defining the technology behind almost every part of our digital world</em></p>
<p class="p1">OpenAPI Spec is currently the most used API definition format out there, with the number of implementations, and tooling, with API Blueprint, Postman Collections, and other formats trailing behind. It can make sense to support a single API definition when it comes to an individual platforms operations, but when it comes to interoperability with other systems it is important to be multi-lingual and support multiple of the top machine-readable formats out there today.</p>
<p class="p1">In my monitoring of the API sector, one service provider has stood out when it comes to being a truly multi-lingual API definition service provider--the SDK generation provider, APIMATIC. The company made API definitions the heart of its operations, generating what they call development experience (DX) kits, from a central API definition uploaded by users--supporting OpenAPI Spec, API Blueprint, Postman Collections, and other top formats. The approach has allowed the company to quickly expand into new areas like documentation, testing, continuous integration, as well as opening up their API definition translation as a separate service called <a href="https://apimatic.io/transformer">API Transformer</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://apimatic.io/transformer">API Transformer</a> allows anyone to input an API Blueprint, Swagger, WADL, WSDL, Google Discovery, RAML 0.8 - 1.0, I/O Docs - Mashery, HAR 1.2, Postman Collection 1.0 - 2.0, Mashape, or APIMATIC Format API definition and then translate and export in a&nbsp; API Blueprint, Swagger 1.0 - 1.2, Swagger 2.0 JSON, Swagger 2.0 YAML, WADL - W3C 2009, RAML 0.8 - 1.0, Postman Collection 1.0 - 2.0, and their own APIMATIC Format. You can execute API definition translations through their interface or seamlessly integrate with the API Transformer API definition conversation API.</p>
<p class="p1">There is no reason that an API provider and API service providers shouldn&rsquo;t be multi-lingual. It is fine to adopt a single API definition as part of your own API operations, but when it comes to working with external groups, there is no excuse for not being able to work with any of the top API definition formats. The translation of API definitions will increasingly be essential to doing business throughout the API life cycle, requiring each company to have an API definition translation engine baked into their continuous integration workflow, transforming how they do business and build software.</p>

<p>I was roaming <a href="https://cloud.google.com/prediction/docs/reference/v1.6/">through Google's Prediction </a><a href="https://cloud.google.com/prediction/docs/reference/v1.6/">API</a>, and I thought <a href="https://cloud.google.com/prediction/docs/gallery">their prediction gallery provides us a look at a shift occurring right now in how we deliver APIs.</a>&nbsp;I predict that machine learning galleries and marketplaces will&nbsp;become all the rage, independently operating like <a href="https://algorithmia.com/">Algorithmia</a>, or part of a specific API like the Google prediction gallery.</p>
<p>Ok, let me put it out there that I hate the use of word prediction. If I was naming the service, I would have called it "execution", or more precisely a "machine training (MT) model execution API". I know I'll never get my way, but I have to put it out there how bullshit many of the terms we use in the space are--ok, back to the API blah blah blah, as my daughter would say.</p>
<p>A common element of API portals for the last decade has included an application gallery, showcasing the apps that are developed on top of an API. Now, when an API offers up machine learning (training) (ML) execution capabilities, either generally or very specialized model execution (ie, genomics, financial), there should also be a gallery of available mobiles, or simply models that have been delivered as part of platform operations--just like we have done with APIs &amp; applications.</p>
<p>I see this stuff as the evolution of the algorithmic layer of API operations. Meaning that most APIs are delivering data or content, but there is a 3rd layer that is about wrapping algorithms, and in the current machine learning and artificial intelligence craze, this approach to delivering algorithmic APIs will continue to be popular. It's not an ML revolution, it is simply an evolution in how we are delivering API resources, leveraging ML models as the core wrapper (Google was smart for open sourcing TensorFlow).</p>
<p>Developing ML models, and making them deployable via AWS, Google, Azure, as well as marketplaces like Algorithmia will become a common approach for the API providers who are further along in their API journey, and have their resources well-defined, modular, and easily deployed in a retail or wholesale manner. While 90% of the ML implementations we will see in 2017 will be smoke and mirrors, 10% will deliver some interesting value that can be used across a growing number of industries--keeping machine training (MT), and machine training execution APIs like Google Prediction something I will be paying attention to. ;-)</p>

<p class="p1"><em>This is an article from the current edition of the&nbsp;<a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/guide/">API Evangelist industry guide to API definitions</a>. The guide is designed to be a summary of the world of API definitions, providing the reader with a recent summary of the variety of specifications that are defining the technology behind almost every part of our digital world.</em></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://federation.data.gov/">The U.S. Data Federation</a> is a federal government effort to facilitate data interoperability and harmonization across federal, state, and local government agencies by highlighting common data formats, API specifications, and metadata vocabularies. The project is focusing on being a coordinating interoperability across government agencies by showcasing and supporting use cases that demonstrate unified and coherent data architectures across disparate agencies, institutions, and organizations.</p>
<p class="p1">The project is designed to shine a light on &ldquo;emerging data standards and API initiatives across all levels of government, convey the level of maturity for each effort, and facilitate greater participation by government agencies&rdquo;--definitely in alignment with the goal of this guide. There are currently seven projects profiled as part of the U.S. Data Federation, including Building &amp; Land Development Specification, National Information Exchange Model, Open Referral, Open311, Project Open Data, Schema.org, and the Voting Information Project.</p>
<p class="p1">By providing a single location for agencies to find common schema documentation tools, schema validation tools, and automated data aggregation and normalization capabilities, the project is hoping to incentivize and stimulate reusability and interoperability across public data and API implementations. Government agencies of all shapes and sizes can use the common blueprints available in the U.S. Data Federation to reduce costs, speed up the implementation of projects, while also opening them up for augmenting and extending using their APIs, and common schema.</p>
<p class="p1">It is unclear what resources the U.S. Data Federation will have available in the current administration, but it looks like the project is just getting going, and intends to add more specifications as they are identified. The model reflects an approach that should be federated and evangelized at all levels of government, but also provides a blueprint that could be applied in other sectors like healthcare, education, and beyond. Aggregating common data formats, API specifications, metadata vocabularies, and authentication scopes will prove to be critical to the success of the overall climate of almost any industry doing business on the web in 2017.</p>

        <span class="post-date">27 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-hang-loose.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/03/15/a-tighter-api-contract-with-grpc/">I wrote about how gRPC API implements deliver a tighter&nbsp;API contract</a>, but I wanted to also explore more thought from that same conversation, about how hypermedia APIs can help deliver a more evolvable API contract. The conversation where these thoughts were born was focused on the differences between REST and gRPC, in which hypermedia and GraphQL also came up. Leaving me thinking about how our API design and deployment decisions can impact the API contract we are putting forth to our consumers.</p>
<p>In contrast to gRPC, going with a hypermedia design for your API, your client relationship can change and evolve, providing an environment for things to flex and change. Some APIs, especially internal API, and trusted partners might be better suited for gRPC performance, but when you need&nbsp;to manage volatility and change across a distributed client base, hypermedia might be a better approach. I'm not advocating one over the other, I am just trying to understand the different types of API contracts brought to the table with each approach, so I can better articulate in my storytelling.</p>
<p>I'd say that hypermedia and gRPC approaches give API providers a different type of control over API clients that are consuming resources. gRPC enables dictating a high performance tighter coupling by generating clients, and hypermedia allows for shifts in what resources are available, what schema are being applied, and changes that might occur with each version, potentially without changes to the client. The API contract can evolve (within logical boundaries), without autogeneration of clients, and interference at this level.</p>
<p>As I learn about this stuff&nbsp;and consider the API contract implications, I feel like hypermedia helps API provides navigation change, evolve and shift to deliver resources to a more unknown, and distributed client base. gRPC seems like it provides a better contract for use in your known, trusted, and higher performance environments. Next, I will be diving into what API discovery looks like in a gRPC world, and coming back to this comparison with hypermedia, and delivering a contract.&nbsp;I am feeling like API discovery is another area that hypermedia will make sense, further helping API providers and API consumers conduct business in a fast changing environment.</p>

        <span class="post-date">24 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://developer.uber.com/products/drivers"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2017_03_21_at_10.42.50_pm.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I was taking a look at the new <a href="https://developer.uber.com/products/drivers">Uber Driver API</a> and trying to understand the possibilities with the API, and some of the the motivations behind Uber's launch of the API. According to Uber, <em>"o</em><span><em>ur Driver API lets you build services and solutions that make the driver experience more productive and rewarding. With the driver's permission, you can use trip data, earnings, ratings and more to shape the future of the on-demand economy."</em> Providing an interesting opportunity for partners to step up and help build useful apps that Uber drivers can leverage in their worlds, helping them be more successful in their work.</span></p>
<p><span>The first dimension of the Uber Driver API I find interesting is that it is not an API that is about their core business--ridesharing. It is focused on making their drivers more successful, and developing tools, and integrations that make their lives easier. I could see something like this evolving to other platforms like AirBnB, and other sharing or gig economy platforms, helping operators make sense of their worlds, while also strengthening partnerships and hopefully their relationship with operators along the way.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The second dimension I find interesting is thinking about why Uber is publishing their Driver API. At first glance it is all about making their drivers happy--something Uber needs a lot of help with currently. However, once you think a little more about it, you can start to see a bigger picture that Uber is looking to paint of their drivers. The company's leverage over drivers has proven to only go so far, and they need to understand more about the lives of their drivers, and if they can invite corporate partners to do their taxes, and potentially other key tasks in their lives, a greater picture of their&nbsp;life will come into focus.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If an Uber driver is also a Lyft driver, the Uber Driver API gives them more of a look into their competitor's accounting. They also get a better understanding of what else their drivers have going on, and other ways they can increase their leverage over them. It's fascinating to think about. Right now, all the examples Uber providers are tax related, but I'm sure other types of partners will emerge--it is why you do APIs. Open up an API, and people will line up innovate for you, helping you understand the dimensions of your driver's life. It is a fascinating look at why you would do APIs, and how there is almost always more than one dimension to why a company will deploy&nbsp;an API.</span></p>
<p><span>I am sure there are other reasons I am not considering here. Maybe now that I've planted the seed in my brain, I'll come up with some other incentives for why Uber operates their APIs as they do--it is fascinating stuff to unpack.</span></p>

        <span class="post-date">24 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2017/introducing-the-periscope-producer-api"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/periscope_twitter.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>It is common for API providers to be really private with their APIs, and we often hear about providers restricting access as time goes by. So, when API providers loosen up restrictions on their APIs, inviting wider use by developers, making them public--I think it is worth taking notice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A recent example of this in the wild is from the API poster child Twitter, with their <a href="https://www.periscope.tv/">Periscope video service</a>. <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2017/introducing-the-periscope-producer-api">Twitter has announced that they are slowly opening up access to the Periscope video API</a>, something that has been only available to a handful of trusted partners, and via the mobile application--there was no way to upload a video without using your mobile device. Twitter is still "l<span>imiting access to fewer strategic partners for a period", but at least you can apply to see if your interests overlap with Twitters interests. It also sounds like Twitter will continue to widen access as time goes on, and as it makes sense to their Periscope strategy.</span></p>
<p>While I wished we lived in a world where API developers were all well behaved, and API providers could open up services to the public from day one, this isn't the reality we find on the web today. Twitter's cautious approach to rolling out the Periscope API should provide other API providers with an example of how you can do this sensibly, only letting in the API consumers that are in alignment with your goals. Slowly opening up, making sure the service is stable, and meets the needs of consumers, partners, as well as helps meet a platform's business objectives.</p>
<p>Hopefully, Twitter's approach to launching the Periscope API provides us with a positive example of how you can become more public APIs, instead of always locking things down. There is no single way to launch your APIs, but I'd say that Twitter's cautious approach is probably a good idea when you operate in such a competitive space, or when you don't have a lot of experience operating a fully public API--start with a handful of trusted partners, and open things up to a slightly wider group as you feel comfortable.</p>
<p>Thanks, Twitter for providing me with a positive example I can showcase--it is good to see that after a decade you can still launch new APIs, and understand the value of them to your core business--even amidst the often intense and volatile environment that is the Twitter platform.</p>

        <p><a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/guide/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/api_definitions_webconcepts_screenshot.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><em>This is an article from the current edition of the&nbsp;<a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/guide/">API Evangelist industry guide to API definitions</a>. The guide&nbsp;is designed to be a summary of the world of API definitions, providing the reader with a recent summary of the variety of specifications that are defining the technology behind almost every part of our digital world.</em></p>
<p class="p1">Keeping up with the standards bodies like International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)&nbsp; can be a full-time job. Thankfully,&nbsp; Erik Wilde (<a href="https://twitter.com/dret">@dret</a>) has help simply and made the concepts and specifications that make the web work more accessible and easier to understand, with his <a href="http://webconcepts.info">WebConcepts.info</a> project.</p>
<p class="p1">According to Erik, &ldquo;the Web&rsquo;s Uniform Interface is based on a large and growing set of specifications. These specifications establish the shared concepts that providers and consumers of Web services can rely on. Web Concepts is providing an overview of these concepts and of the specifications defining them.&rdquo; His work is a natural fit for what I am trying to accomplish with my API definition industry guide, as well as supporting other areas of my research.</p>
<p class="p1">One of the areas that slows API adoption is a lack of awareness of the concepts and specifications that make the web work among developers who are providing and consuming APIs. The modern API leverages the same technology that drives the web--this is why it is working so well. The web is delivering HTML for humans, and APIs are using the same to deliver machine-readable data, content, and access to algorithms online. If a developer is not familiar with the fundamental building blocks of the web, the APIs they provide, and the applications they build on top of APIs will always be deficient.</p>
<p class="p1">This project provides an overview of 28 web concepts with 643 distinct implementations&nbsp; aggregated across five separate organizations including the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), Java Community Process (JCP), Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS), and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)--who all contribute to what we know as the web.&nbsp; An awareness and literacy around the 28 concepts aggregated by Web Concepts is essential for any API developer and architect looking to fully leverage the power of the web as part of their API work.</p>
<p class="p1">After aggregating the 28 web concepts from the five standards organization, Web Concepts additionally aggregates 218 actual specifications that API developers, architects, and consumers should be considering when putting APIs to work. Some of these specifications are included as part of this API Definition guide, and I will be working to add additional specifications in future editions of this guide, as it makes sense. The goal of this guide is to help bring awareness, literacy, and proficiency with common API and data patterns, making use of the work Web Concepts project, and building on the web literacy work already delivered by Erik, just makes sense.</p>
<p class="p1">Web Concepts is published as a Github repository, leveraging Github Pages for the website. He has worked hard to make the concepts and specification available as JSON feeds, providing a machine-readable feed that can be integrated into existing API design, deployment, and management applications--providing web literacy concepts and specifications throughout the API life cycle.&nbsp; All JSON data is generated from the source data, which is managed as a set of XML descriptions of specifications, with the build process based upon XSLT and Jekyll, providing multiple ways to approach all concepts and specifications, while maintaining the relationship and structure of all the moving parts that make up the web.</p>
<p class="p1">When it comes to the startup space, the concepts that make up the web, and the specifications that make it all work, might seem a little boring, something only the older engineers pay attention to.&nbsp; Web Concepts helps soften, and make these critical concepts and specifications accessible and digestible for a new generation of web and API developers--think of them as gummy versions of vitamins. If we are going to standardize how APIs are designed, deployed, and managed--making all of this much more usable, scalable, and interoperable, we are going to have to all get on the same page (aka the web).</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://webconcepts.info/">Web Concepts</a> is an open source project, and Erik encourages feedback on the concepts&nbsp;and specifications. I encourage you to spend time on the site regularly&nbsp;and see where you can integrate the JSON feeds into your systems, services, and tooling. We have a lot of work ahead of us to make sure the next generation of programmers have the base amount of web literacy necessary to keep the web strong and healthy. There are two main ways to contribute to the building blocks of the web: participate as a contributor to the standards body, or you can make sure you are implementing common concepts and specifications throughout your work, contributing to the web, and not just walled gardens and closed platforms.</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Mar 2017</span>
        <p>I was studying examples of how I can validate the data returned from <a href="http://developer.open.referral.adopta.agency/">a human services APIs demo</a>, and develop a set of API tests, as well as API service providers who can implement the tests, for cities to consider as part of their API deployments that are serving up locations and organizations where you can find critical services. I'm looking for examples of the common things like API availability and response time, but I'm also looking to get very granular and specialized to organizational, location, and service APIs.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.runscope.com/"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/runscope_data_validation.png" alt="" width="95%" align="center" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.runscope.com/">The image I borrowed from RunScope helps visualize what I'm talking about, showing us how we can keep an eye on the basics, but also getting really granular when specifying what we expect from of our APIs</a>. I have a pretty good imagination when it comes to thinking of scenarios I want to test for, but I'm also looking for any API providers who might be already sharing their tests&nbsp;and being more transparent when it comes to their API monitoring and testing practices. If you know of any API&nbsp;providers that would be willing to share the lists of what types of things they test for, I'd love to hear more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm thinking a regular blog series on different examples of how people are testing APIs from a diverse range of business sectors might help stimulate people's imagination when it comes to API testing concepts. I'm thinking it is another area that we could all learn a lot from each other&nbsp;if there was just a little bit of sharing. I'd love it if the examples were machine readable and reusable in any API testing service, but I would settle for just a blog post, or sharing of a bulleted list of API tests via email, or another channel. ;-)</p>

<p>Building on <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/02/09/api-management-is-getting-more-modular-and-composable/">earlier stories about how my API partners are making API deployment more modular and composable</a>, and pushing forward my understanding of what is possible with API deployment, I'm looking into the details of what <a href="http://apis.how/bgdteovduo">DreamFactory</a> enables when it comes to API deployment. "<span>DreamFactory is a free, Apache 2 open source project that runs on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. DreamFactory is scalable, stateless, and portable" -- making it pretty good candidate for running it wherever you need.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/03/16/the-ability-to-deploy-apis-in-aws-google-or-microsoft-clouds/">After spending time at Google and hearing about how they want to enable multi-cloud infrastructure deployment</a>, I wanted to see how my API service provider partners are able to actually power these visions of running your APIs anywhere, in any infrastructure. <a href="https://www.dreamfactory.com/features">Using DreamFactory you can deploy your APIs using Docker, Kubernetes, or directly from a Github repository</a>, something I'm exploring as standard operating procedure for government agencies, like we see with <a href="https://github.com/18F/fs-middlelayer-api">18F's&nbsp;US Forest Service ePermit Middlelayer API</a>--in my opinion, all federal, state, and local government should be able to deploy API infrastructure like this.</p>
<p>One of the projects I am working on this week is creating a base blueprint of what it will take to deploy a <a href="http://developer.open.referral.adopta.agency/">human services API</a> for any city in Google or Azure. I have a demo working on AWS already, but I need a basic understanding of what it will take to do the same in any cloud environment. I'm not in the business of hosting and operating APIs for anyone, let alone for government agencies--this is why I have partners like DreamFactory, who I can route specific projects as they come in. Obviously, I am looking to support my partners, as they support me, but I'm also looking to help other companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies better leverage the cloud providers they are already using.</p>
<p>I'll share more stories about how I'm deploying APIs to AWS, as well as Google and Azure, as I do the work over the next couple of weeks. I'm looking to develop a healthy toolbox of solutions for government agencies to use. This weeks project is focused on the human services data specification, but next week I'm going to look replicating the model to allow for other <a href="http://schema.org">Schema.org vocabulary</a>, providing simple blueprints for deploying other common APIs like products, directories, link listings, and directories. My goal is to provide a robust toolbox of APIs that anyone can launch in AWS, Google, and Azure, with a push of a button--eventually.</p>

<p class="p1"><em>This is an article from the current edition of the&nbsp;<a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/guide/">API Evangelist industry guide to API definitions</a>. The guide<span>&nbsp;is designed to be a summary of the world of API definitions, providing the reader with a recent summary of the variety of specifications that are defining the technology behind almost every part of our digital world.</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification">The OpenAPI Specification</a>, formerly known as Swagger is approaching an important milestone, version 3.0 of the specification, but it is also the first major release since the specification was entered into the Linux Foundation. Swagger was the creation of Tony Tam of Wordnik back in 2010, but after the project was acquired by SmartBear in 2015, the company donated the specification to the newly formed OpenAPI Initiative (OAI) which is part of the Linux Foundation. Swagger has now been reborn as the OpenAPI Specification, and in early 2017 is approaching its first major release under the guidance of a diverse group of governing members.</p>
<p class="p1">Version 3.0 of the API specification format has taken a much more modular, and reusable approach to defining the surface area of an API, enabling more power and versatility when it comes to describing the request and response models, as well as providing details on the common components that make up API usage like the underlying data schema and security definitions. There are numerous changes to the API specification, but there are just a handful that will have a significant impact across every stop along the API life cycle where API definitions are making an impact.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Hosts</strong></p>
<p class="p1">When describing your API, you can now provide multiple hosts, allowing you to better deal with the complexity of how APIs might be located in a single location, or spread across multiple cloud location, and global infrastructure.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Content Negotiation</strong></p>
<p class="p1">You can now provide content objects to define the relationship between response objects, media types, and schema, opening up the negotiation of exactly the type of content needed, encouraging the design of multiple rich dimensions for any single API resource.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Body</strong></p>
<p class="p1">The latest version of the specification plays catch-up when it comes to allowing the body of a request and response to be defined separately from the request parameters, allowing for more control over the payload of any API calls.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Schema</strong></p>
<p class="p1">There is an increased investment in JSON Schema, including the support of `oneOf`, `anyOf` and `not` functions, allowing for alternative schema, as well as the standard JSON schema definition included.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Components</strong></p>
<p class="p1">The new components architecture really reflects APIs, making everything very modular, reusable, and much more coherent and functional. The new version encourages good schema and component reuse,&nbsp; helping further bringing the definition into focus.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Linking</strong></p>
<p class="p1">While not quite full hypermedia, version 3.0 of the OpenAPI Spec supports linking, allowing for the description of relationships between paths, giving a nod towards hypermedia design pattern, making this version the most resilient so far.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Webhooks</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Like the nod towards hypermedia, the specification now allows for the inclusion of callbacks that can be attached to a subscription operation describing an outbound operation--providing much needed webhook descriptions as part of API operations, making it much more real time and event driven.</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>Examples</strong></p>
<p class="p1">The new version enables API architects to better describe, and provide examples of APIs responses and requests, helping make API integration a learning experience, by providing examples for use beyond just documentation descriptions.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Responding to a large number of API providers, and the reality on the ground for many implementations, the new version allows for the definition of cookies as part of API requests.</p>
<p class="p1">These nine areas represent the most significant changes to the OpenAPI Spec 3.0. The most notable shift is the componentized, modular, reusable aspect of the specification. After that, it is the content negotiation, linking, web hooks, and other changes that are moving the needle. It is clear that the 3.0 version of the specification has considered the design patterns across a large number of implementations, providing a pretty wide-reaching specification for defining what an API does, in a world where every API can be a special snowflake.</p>
<p class="p1">In 2017, the OpenAPI Spec is the clear leader of the API definition formats, with the largest adoption, as well as the amount of tooling developed. While documentation and SDK generation are still the top two reasons for crafting API definitions, there are numerous other reasons for using API definitions including mocking, testing, monitoring, IDE integration, and much, much more. In 2017, the OpenAPI Spec is the clear leader of the API definitions format. It has the highest usage rate, as well as the largest number of tooling (or tools?) available.</p>

<p>I'm keeping an eye on the different approaches to deploying infrastructure coming out of AWS, Google, Microsoft and other providers. In my version of the near future, we should be able to deploy any API we want, in any infrastructure we want with a single push of a button. We are getting there, as&nbsp;<a href="https://t.co/IzZs6W0wAr">I'm seeing more publish to Heroku buttons</a>, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/12/where-is-the-deploy-to-aws-and-google-button/">AWS and Azure deployment packages</a>, and I recently came across the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/launcher/">Google Cloud Launcher</a>, which I think will work well for deploying a variety of API driven solutions--we just need more selection&nbsp;and a button!</p>
<p>All the parts and pieces for this type of push button API deployment exist already, we just need someone to step up and provide a dead simple framework for defining and embedding the buttons, abstracting away the complexities of each cloud platform. I want to be able to take a single manifest for my open source or wholesale API on Github, and allow anyone to deploy it into Heroku, AWS, Google, Azure, or anywhere else they want. I want the technical, business, and legal complexities of deployment abstracted away for me, the API provider.</p>
<p>API management has matured a lot over the last 10 years, and API design and definitions are currently flourishing. We need a lot more investment in helping people easily deploy APIs, wherever they need. I think this layer of interoperability is the responsibility of the emerging API service providers like <a href="http://apis.how/5ytnitnakm">Restlet</a>, <a href="http://apis.how/bgdteovduo">DreamFactory</a>, or maybe even <a href="http://apis.how/kjtj5bbuxu">APIMATIC</a>. I will keep tracking on what I'm seeing evolve out of the leading cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and now Google with their Cloud Launcher. I will also keep pushing on my API service provider partners in the space to enable API deployment like this--I am guessing they will just need a little nudging to see the opportunity around providing API deployment in this seamless, cloud-agnostic way.</p>

        <span class="post-date">22 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><a href="http://konpa.github.io/devicon/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/devicons_screenshot.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://google.stack.network/">I am working on profiling 75 of the Google APIs</a>, and one thing I struggle with at this scale is standardizing the images I use, or more specifically, icons that represent each service as well as the value they deliver under the hood--something Google seriously needs to get more organized in by the way. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/01/25/moving-towards-a-meaningful-set-of-icons-for-the-api-community/">I have written before about having a set of icons for the API sector</a>, for <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/21/a-new-api-programming-language-sdk-icon-set/">SDK related icons</a>, and also <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/10/21/icons-to-describe-each-of-your-api-resources-like-aws/">about how Amazon is getting more organized when it comes to icons for the AWS platform</a>, as I beat this drum about the need for common imagery.</p>
<p>While I am glad that Amazon is started to think about iconography when it comes to working with APIs at scale, a lead that Google and Microsoft should follow, I'm hoping that API icons are something that someone will tackle at the same level as say a <a href="http://schema.org">Schema.org</a>. I would like to see API provider (company) level icons, <a href="http://konpa.github.io/devicon/">building on the work of Devicon</a>, but I'd also like to see individual icons developed for common resources that are made available via APIs--like compute, storage, images, video, etc.</p>
<p>What Amazon is doing provides the best model we have so far, but I want to make sure icons are not vendor specific. I would like to see a universal icon to represent a compute API for instance, whether it was Amazon, Google, or Microsoft. Think about IFTTT or Zapier, but something that would universally represent the valuable bits and bytes we are putting to use via individual platforms, but are increasingly also moving around between platforms--I want a common visual iconography we can use to communicate about what is being done with APIs.</p>
<p>There is a ton of work involved with establishing a project of this scale. Ideally, it is something that would also involve API providers, and not just be an external thing. I'd also like to see each icon be more than just a visual icon, I'd like there to be semantics and vocabulary attached to each image. Imagine if we had a common set of icons describe machine learning APIs, that helped us quickly understand what they do, but would also help us more consistently articulate the reality of what they do, and do not do (ie. Facial Recognition, Sentiment Anlysis, etc.).</p>
<p>I am going to keep talking about this until someone either does it&nbsp;or gives me the money to pay someone to do it. Sadly, I feel like it will end up being like the rest of common API definitions and tooling, we'll see each provider do it on their own, where all meaning and vocabulary becomes platform-driven, and not about actually finding a common language to communicate about what is possible with APIs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">22 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/guide/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/api_definitions_human_services_screenshot.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><em>This is an article from the current edition of the <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/guide/">API Evangelist industry guide to API definitions</a>. The guide<span style="font-size: 9px;">&nbsp;is designed to be a summary of the world of API definitions, providing the reader with a recent summary of the variety of specifications that are defining the technology behind almost every part of our digital world.</span></em></p>
<p class="p1">A lot of attention is given to APIs and the world of startups, but in 2017 this landscape is quickly shifting beyond just the heart of the tech space, with companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies of all shapes and sizes are putting APIs to work. API definitions are being applied to the fundamental building blocks of the tech sector, quantifying the computational, storage, images, videos, and other essential resources powering web, mobile, and device based applications. This success is now spreading to other sectors, defining other vital resources that are making a real impact in our communities.</p>
<p class="p1">One API making an impact in communities is the Human Services Data Specification (HSDS), also known as the Open Referral Ohana API. The project began as a Code for America project, providing an API, website, and administrative system for managing the organizations, locations, and the human services that communities depend on. Open Referral, the governing organization for HSDS, and the Ohana API is working with API Evangelist and other partners to define the next generation of the human services data specification, API definition, as well as the next generation of API, website, admin, and developer portal implementations.</p>
<p class="p1">The HSDS Specification API isn&rsquo;t about any single API, it is a suite of API-first definitions, schema, and open tooling that cities, counties, states&nbsp;and federal government agencies can download or fork, and employ to help manage vital human services for their communities. Providing not just a website for finding vital services, but a complete API ecosystem that can be deployed incentivizing developers to build important web, mobile, and other applications on top of a central human services system. Better delivering on the mission of human services organizations, and meeting the demands of their constituents.</p>
<p class="p1">This approach to delivering APIs centers around a common data schema, extending it as an OpenAPI Spec definition, describing how that data is accessed&nbsp;and put to use across a variety of applications, including a central website and administrative system. While server-side HSDS API implementations, website, mobile, administrative, developer portal, and other implementations are important, the key to the success of this model is a central OpenAPI definition of the HSDS API. This definition connects all the implementations within an API&rsquo;s ecosystem, but it also provides the groundwork for a future where all human services implementations are open and interoperable with other implementations--establishing a federated network of services meeting the needs of the communities they serve.</p>
<p class="p1">Right now each city is managing one or multiple human service implementations. Even though some of these implementations operate in overlapping communities, few of them are providing 3rd party access, let alone providing integration between overlapping geographic regions. The HSDS API approach employs an API-first approach, focusing on the availability and access of the HSDS schema, then adding on a website, administrative and API developer portals to support. This model opens up human services to humans via the website, which is integrated with the central API, but then also opens up the human services for inclusion into other websites, mobile and device applications, as well as integration with other systems.</p>
<p class="p1">The HSDS OpenAPI spec and schema provide a reusable blueprint that can be used to standardize how we provide human services. The open source approach to delivering definitions, schema, and code reduces the cost of deployment and operation for cash-strapped public organizations and agencies. The API-first approach to delivering human services also opens up resources for inclusion in our applications and system, potentially outsourcing the heavy lifting to trusted partners, and 3rd party developers interested in helping augment and extend the mission of human service organizations and groups.</p>
<p class="p1">If you&rsquo;d like to learn more about the HSDS API you can visit <a href="http://openreferral.org">Open Referral</a>. From there you can get involved in the discussion, and find existing open source definitions, schema, and code for putting HSDS to work. If you&rsquo;d like to contribute to the project, there are numerous opportunities to join the discussion about next generation of the schema and OpenAPI Spec, as well as develop server-side&nbsp;and client-side implementations.</p>

<p>It is easy for me to get excited about a new API. I'm an engineer. I'm a dude. I am the API Evangelist. It easy to think about the potential for good when it comes to APIs. It is much harder to suspend the logical side of my brain&nbsp;and think about the ways in which APIs can be used in negative ways. As a technologist it is natural for me to focus in on the technology, and tune out the rest of the world--it is what we do. It takes a significant amount of extra effort to stop, suspend the portion of your brain that technology whispers to, and think about the unintended consequences, and the pros and cons of why we are doing APIs.</p>
<p>Technologists aren't very good at slowing down and thinking about the pros/cons of connecting something to the Internet, let alone whether or not an API should even exist in the first place (it has to exist!). <a href="http://www.securityweek.com/network-layer-ddos-attacks-hit-record-levels-imperva">As I read a story about the increases in DDOS attacks on the network layer of our online world</a>, I can't help but think that with each new API we deploy, that we are significantly increasing the attack surface area for our businesses, organizations, institutions, and government agencies. It feels like we are good at thinking about the amazing API potential, but we really suck at seeing what a target we are putting on our back when we do APIs.</p>
<p>We seem to be marching forward, drunk on the potential of APIs&nbsp;and Internet-connected everything. We aren't properly securing the technology we have, something we can see playing out with each wave of vulnerabilities, breaches, and leaks. We are blindly pushing forward with new API implementations, and using the same tactics we are using for our web and mobile technology, something we are seeing play out with the Internet of Things, and the vulnerable cameras, printers, and another object we are connecting to the Internet using APIs.</p>
<p>With each API we add, we are increasing the attack surface area for our systems and devices. APIs can be secured, but from what I'm seeing we aren't investing in security with our existing APIs, something that is being replicated with each wave of deployments. We need to get better at thinking about the negative consequences of doing APIs. We need to stop making ourselves targets. We need to get better at thinking about whether or not an API should exist or not. We need a way to better visualize the target surface area we've crafted for ourselves using APIs, and be a little more honest with ourselves about why we are doing this.</p>

<p>This is my regular public service reminder of why I do API Evangelist. I do not evangelize APIs because I think everybody should be doing them, that they are the solution to all of our problems, or because I have an API I want you to buy (I have other things for you to buy). I do API Evangelist because I want to better understand how platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Uber, and others are operating&nbsp;and impacting our personal and professional lives.</p>
<p>I do believe in APIs as an important tool in our professional toolboxes, but Silicon Valley, our government(s), and many other bad actors have shown me that APIs will more often be used for shady things, rather than the positive API vision I have in my head. I still encourage companies, organizations, institutions,&nbsp;and agencies to do APIs, but I spend equal amount of time ensuring people are doing APIs in a more open and equitable way&nbsp;while still encouraging folks to also embark on their API journeys--taking more control over how we store, share, and put our bits and bytes to work each day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>APIs are playing a role in almost every news story we read today, from fake news and elections to cyber security,&nbsp;healthcare with the FHIR API standard, or banking with PSDS, to automobiles and transportation with Tesla and Uber. I can keep going all day long, talking about the ways APIs are influencing and delivering vital aspects of our personal and professional lives. In ALL of these situation's it's not the API that is important, it is the access, availability, and observability of the technology that is impacting the lives of humans--APIs are just the digital connector where our mobile phones and other devices are being connected to the Internet.</p>
<p>I like to regularly remind myself why the fuck I'm doing API Evangelist, so I don't burn out like I have before and end up roaming the streets foaming at the mouth again. I also do it to remind people of why I do API Evangelist, so they don't just think I'm a cheerleader for technology (rah rah rah, gooo&nbsp;APIs). My mission isn't just about APIs, it's ensuring APIs are in place and allow us to better understand the inputs and outputs of the technology invading all aspects of our lives. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/10/25/thinking-about-an-api-observability-stack/">Without the observability into the backend systems and algorithms</a> that are driving out personal and professional lives, we are screwed--which is why I do API Evangelist, to help ensure there is observability into how technology is impacting our world.</p>

<p>Most of the APIs I look at are special snowflakes. The definition&nbsp;and designs employed are usually custom-crafted without thinking other existing APIs, or standards that already in place. There are several contributing factors to why this is, ranging from the types of developers who are designing APIs, to incentive models put in place because of investment&nbsp;and intellectual property constraints. So, whenever I find an API that is employing an existing standard, I feel compelled to showcase&nbsp;and help plant the seeds in others minds that we should be speaking a common language instead of always being a special snowflake.</p>
<p>One of these APIs that I came across recently was the <a href="https://developers.google.com/spectrum/v1">Google Spectrum Database API</a> which has employed a standard&nbsp;<span>defined by the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-paws-protocol/">IETF Protocol to Access White Space (PAWS)</a><span>. &nbsp;I wouldn't say the API is the best-designed API, but it does follow a known standard, that is already in use by an industry, which in my experience can go further than having the best-designed API. The best product doesn't always win in this game, sometimes it is just about getting adoption with the widest possible audience.&nbsp;</span>I am guessing that the Google Spectrum Database API is targeting a different type of engineering audience than their more modern, machine learning and other APIs are, so following standards is probably more of a consideration.</p>
<p><span>I wish more APIs would share a little bit about the thoughts that went into the definition and design of their APIs, sharing their due diligence of existing APIs and standards, and other considerations that were included in the process of crafting an API. I'd like to see some leadership in this area, as well as some folks admitting that they didn't have the time, budget, expertise, or whatever the other reasons why you are a special snowflake. It is a conversation we should be having, otherwise, we may never fully understand why we aren't seeing the adoption we'd like to see with our APIs.</span></p>

<p>The way my research works&nbsp;is that I keep an eye on the world of APIs through monitoring the social media, blogs, Github, and other channels of companies, organizations, institutions, and agencies doing interesting things with APIs. I curate information as I discover&nbsp;and learn across the API sector, then I craft stories for my blog(s). Eventually, all of this ends up being published <a href="http://apievangelist.com/blog/">to the main API Evangelist blog</a>, as well as <a href="http://apievangelist.com/">the 70+ individual areas of my research from definition to deprecation</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a couple years now I have also published a guide for the top areas of my research, including API <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com">definitions</a>, <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">design</a>, <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">deployment</a>, and <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com">management</a>. These guides have always been a complete snapshot of my research, but in 2017 I am rebooting them to be a more curated, summary of each area of my research. My API definition guide is now ready for prime time after receiving some feedback from my community, so I wanted to share with you.</p>
<p>I am versioning and managing all of my API industry guides using the Github repositories in which I publish each of my research areas, so you can comment on the API definition guide, and <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist/definitions/issues">submit suggestions for future editions using the Github issues for the project.</a>&nbsp;My goal with this new edition of the API Evangelist API definition guide is to make it a community guide to the world of API definitions, schema, scopes. So please, let me know your thoughts--it is meant to be a community guide.</p>
<p><a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/guide/">I am keeping my API definition guide available for free to the public.</a> You can also <a href="https://gum.co/Wlwnk">purchase a copy via Gumroad if you'd like to support my work</a>--I depend on your support to pay the bills. I will also funding this work through paid one page or two-page articles in future editions, as well as some sponsor blogs located on certain pages--<a href="mailto:info@apievangelist.com">let me know if you are interested in sponsoring</a>. Thanks as always for your support, I hope my API definitions guide helps you better understand this important layer of the API universe, something that is touching almost every aspect of the API and software development life cycle.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/03/20/google-support-buttons/">Google Support Buttons</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">20 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/03/15/the-relationship-between-dev-relations-and-support/">I talked about the gap between developer relations and support at Google</a>, something that <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/03/15/the-relationship-between-dev-relations-and-support/">Sam Ramji (@sramji) has acknowledged is being worked on</a>. Support for a single API can be a lot of work&nbsp;and is something that is exponentially&nbsp;harder with each API and developer to add to your operations, and after <a href="http://google.stack.network/">looking through 75 of the Google APIs this weekend</a>, you see evidence that Google is working on it.</p>
<p>While there are many Google APIs that still have sub-standard support for their APIs, <a href="https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/support">when you look at Google Sheets you start seeing evidence of their evolved approach to support</a>, with a consistent set of buttons that tackle many of the common areas of <a href="http://support.apievangelist.com">API support</a>. For general questions, Google provides two buttons linked to StackOverflow:</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2017_03_20_at_9.41.01_am.png" alt="" width="90%" /></p>
<p>The search just drops you into Stack Overflow, with the tag "google sheets api", and the ask a new question drops you into the Stack Overflow submit new question form. For bug reporting, they provide a similar set of buttons:</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2017_03_20_at_9.45.01_am.png" alt="" width="90%" /></p>
<p>The search and report bug buttons drop you into the Google Code issues page for Google Sheets, leveraging the issues management for the Gooogle Code repository--something that can just as easily be done with Github issues. Then lastly, they provide a third set of buttons when you are looking to submit a feature:</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2017_03_20_at_9.47.56_am.png" alt="" width="90%" /></p>
<p>Even though there is a typo on the first button, they also leverage Google Code issue management to handle all feature requests. Obviously working to centralize bug and feature reporting, and support management using Google Code--something I do across all my API projects using Github organizations, repositories, and their issue management. I'm guessing Google Support is tapping into Google Code to tackle support across projects at scale.</p>
<p>These support buttons may seem trivial, but they represent a more consistent approach by the API giant to be consistent in how they approach support across their API offerings--something that can go a long way in my experience. It gives your API consumers a familiar and intuitive way to ask questions, submit bugs, and suggest new features. Equally as important, I'm hoping it is also giving Google a consistent way to tackle support for their APIs in a meaningful way, that meets the needs of their API consumers.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/03/20/a-community-strategy-for-my-api-definition-guide/">A Community Strategy For My API Definition Guide</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">20 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/guide/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/api_definitions_2017_03.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I have <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/guide/">tpublished the latest edition of my API definition guide</a>. I've rebooted my industry guides to be a more polished, summary version of my research instead of the rougher, more comprehensive version I've bee publishing for the last couple of years. I'm looking for my guides to better speak to the waves of new people entering the API space, and help them as they continue on their API journey.</p>
<p>In addition to being a little more polished, and having more curated content, my API guides are now going to also be more of a community thing. In the past I've kept pretty tight control over the content I publish to API Evangelist, only opening up the four logos to my partners. Using my API industry guides I want to invite folks from the community to help edit the content, and <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist/definitions/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed">provide editorial feedback</a>--<a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist/definitions/issues/6">even suggesting what should be in future editions</a>. I'm also opening up the guides to include paid content that will help pay for the ongoing publication of the guides with the following opportunities available in the next edition:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>One Page Articles -</strong> Sponsored suggested topics, where I will craft the story and publish in the next edition of the guide--also published on API Evangelist blog after the guide is published.</li>
<li><strong>Two Page Articles&nbsp;-</strong> Sponsored suggested topics, where I will craft the story and publish in the next edition of the guide--also published on API Evangelist blog after the guide is published.Sponsor Slot -&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Sponsor Slot - </strong>On the service and tooling pages there are featured slots, some of which I will be giving to sponsors, who have related produces and services.</li>
<li><strong>Private Distribution - </strong>Allow for private distribution of the industry guide, to partners, and behind lead generation forms, allowing you to use API Evangelist research to connect with customers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even though I will be accepting paid content within these industry guides, and posts via the blog now, they will all be labeled as sponsored posts, and I will also still be adding my voice to each and every piece--if you know me, or read API Evangelist blog you know what this means. I'm looking to keep the lights on, while also opening up the doors for companies in the space to join in the conversation, as well as the average reader--allowing anyone to provide feedback and suggestions via <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist/definitions/issues">the Github issues for each area of research</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com">My API definition research</a> is just the first to come off the assembly line. I will be applying this same model to my <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">design</a>, <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">deployment</a>, and <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com">management</a> research in coming weeks, and eventually <a href="http://apievangelist.com">the rest of my research as it makes sense</a>. If there is a specific research area you'd like to see get attention&nbsp;or would be willing to sponsor in one of the ways listed above, <a href="mailto: kin@apievangelist.com">please let me know</a>. Once I get the core set of my API industry research guides published in this way, I will be working on increasing the distribution beyond just my network of sites, and the API Evangelist digital presence--publishing them to Amazon, and other prominent ecosystems.</p>
<p>I also wanted to take a moment and <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2016/05/28/the-community-has-spoken-api-evangelist-will-stay-as-it-is/">thank everyone in the community who helped m last </a><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2016/05/28/the-community-has-spoken-api-evangelist-will-stay-as-it-is/">year</a>&nbsp;and for everyone who is helping make my research, and the publishing of these industry guides a reality. Your support is important to me, and it is also important to me that my research continues, and is as widely available as it possibly can.&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/openapi_spec_structural_improvements.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I am spending some time adding more tools to <a href="http://openapi.toolbox.apievangelist.com/">my OpenAPI Toolbox</a>, and I'm looking to start evaluating what it will take for tooling providers to evolve their solution from version 2.0 of the OpenAPI Spec to version 3.0. I want to better understand what it will take to evolve the documentation, generators, servers, clients, editors, and other tools that I'm tracking on as part of my toolbox research.</p>
<p>I'm going to spend another couple of weeks populating the toolbox with OpenAPI solutions. Getting them entered with all the relevant metadata. Once I feel the list is good enough, I will begin reaching out to each tool owner, asking what their OpenAPI 3.0 plans are. It will give me a good reason to reach out and see if anyone is even home. I'm assuming that a number of the projects are abandoned, and even that their owners do not have the resources necessary to go from 2.0 to 3.0. Regardless, this is something I want to track on as part of this OpenAPI toolbox research.</p>
<p>The overall architecture of OpenAPI shifted pretty significantly from 2.0 to 3.0. Things are way more modular, and reusable&nbsp;in there, something that will take some work to bring out in most of the tooling areas. Personally, I'm pretty excited for the opportunities when it comes to API documentation and API design editors with OpenAPI 3.0 as the core. I am also hoping that developers step up to make sure that the generators, as well as the server and client code generators become available in a variety of programming languages--we will need this to make sure we keep the momentum that we've established with the specification so far.</p>
<p>If you are looking at developing any tooling using OpenAPI 3.0 I'd love to hear from you. I'd like to hear more about what it will take to either migrate your tool from version 2.0 to 3.0&nbsp;or even hear what it will take to get up and running on 3.0 from scratch. I'm going to get to work on crafting my first OpenAPI definition using version 3.0, then I'm going to begin playing around with some new approaches to API documentation and possibly an API editor or notebook that takes advantage of the changes in the OpenAPI Specification.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/bw_google_aws_microsoft.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I spent a day last week at the Google Community Summit, learning more about the Google Cloud road map, and one thing I kept hearing them focus on was the notion of being able to operate on any cloud platform--not just Google. It's a nice notion, but how real of a concept is it to think we could run seamlessly on any of the top cloud platforms--Google, AWS, and Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The concept is something I'll be exploring more with my <a href="https://openreferral.org/">Open Referral</a>, Human Services Data Specification (HSDS) work. It's an attractive concept, to think I could run the same API infrastructure in any of the leading cloud platforms. I see two significant hurdles in accomplishing this: 1) Getting the developer and IT staff (me) up to speed, and 2) Ensuring your databases and code all runs and scales seamlessly whichever platforms you operate in. I guess I'd have to add 3) Ensure your orchestration and continuous integration works seamlessly across all platforms you operate on.</p>
<p>I am going to get to work deploying an HSDS compliant API on each of the platforms. My goal is to have just a simple yet complete API infrastructure running on Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. It is important to me that these solutions provide a complete stack helping me manage DNS, monitoring, and other important aspects. I'm also looking for there to be APIs for managing all aspects of my API operations--this is how I orchestrate and continuously integrate the APIs which I roll out.</p>
<p>Along with each API that I publish, I will do a write up on what it took to stand up each one, including the cloud services I used, and their API definitions. I am pretty content (for now) on the AWS platform, leveraging Github Pages as the public facade for my projects, and each repositories acting as the platform gears of API code, and definitions. Even though I'm content where I am at, I want to ensure the widest possible options available to cities, and other organizations who are looking to deploy and manage their human service APIs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/autocomplete.gif,qx38712.pagespeed.ce.mdv9wuhtbw.gif" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>The Postman team has been hard at work lately,&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.getpostman.com/2017/02/28/introducing-the-new-data-editor/">releasing their API data editor</a>, as well as <a href="http://blog.getpostman.com/2017/03/07/autocomplete-and-tooltips-for-variables-are-here/">introducing variable highlighting and tooltips</a>. The new&nbsp;<span>autocomplete menu contains a list of all the variables in the current environment, followed by global variables, making your API environment setups more accessible from the Postman interface. Introducing a pretty significant time saver, once you have your environments setup properly.</span></p>
<p>This is a pretty interesting feature, but what makes me most optimistic, is when this approach becomes available for parameters, headers, and some of the data management features we are seeing emerge with the new Portman data editor. It all feels like the UI equivalent of what <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/01/25/the-openapi-specification-version-30-highlights/">we've seen emerge in the latest OpenAPI 3.0 release</a>, helping us better manage and reuse the schema, data, and other bits we put to use across all of our APIs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Imagine when you can design and mock your API in Postman, crafting our API&nbsp;using a common vocabulary. Reusing environment variables, API path resources, parameters, headers, and other common elements already in use across operations. Imagine when I get tooltip suggesting that I use <a href="http://schema.org">Schema.org vocabulary</a>, or possibly even RFCs for a date, currency, and other common definitions. Anyways, I'm liking the features coming out of postman, and I'm also liking that they are regularly blogging about this stuff, so I can keep up to speed on what is going on, and eventually cover here on the blog, and include in my research.</p>

<p>I wanted to provide an easy way to publish and share some of the tools that I'm tracking on in the <a href="http://openapis.org">OpenAPI</a> ecosystem, so I launched <a href="http://openapi.toolbox.apievangelist.com/">my API toolbox</a>. In addition to tracking on the name, description, logo, and URL for OpenAPI tooling, I also wanted to categorize them, helping me better understand the different types of tools that are emerging. As I do with all my research, <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/openapi-toolbox">I published the OpenAPI Toolbox as a Github repository</a>, leveraging <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/openapi-toolbox/blob/master/_data/tools.yaml">its YAML data core to store all the tools</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It will be a never ending project for me to add, update, and archive abandoned projects, but before I got too far down the road I wanted to also begin tracking on the license for each of the tools. I'm still deciding whether or not I want the toolbox to exclusively contain openly licensed tools, or look to provide a more comprehensive directory of tooling that includes unknown and proprietary solutions. I think for now I will just flag any tool I cannot find a license for, and follow up with the owner--it gives me a good excuse to reach out and see if there is anyone home.</p>
<p>Eventually, I want to also provide a search for the toolbox that allows users to search for tools&nbsp;and filter by license. Most of the tools have been Apache 2.0 or MIT license, details that I will continue to keep tracking and reporting on. If you know of any tooling that employs the OpenAPI Specification that should be included feel free to <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/openapi-toolbox/issues">submit a Github issue for the project</a>, or submit a pull request on the repository and add it <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/openapi-toolbox/blob/master/_data/tools.yaml">to the YAML data file that drives that OpenAPI Toolbox</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/schema-org/schema-org.png" alt="" width="30%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was following <a href="https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/pull/1445">the discussion around adding a&nbsp;WebAPI class</a> to Schema.org's core vocabulary, and it got me to think more about the role Schema.org has to play with not just our API definitions, but also significantly influencing API discovery. Meaning that we should be using Schema.org as part of our OpenAPI definitions, providing us with a common vocabulary for communicating around our APIs, but also empowering the discovery of APIs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I describe the relationship between Schema.org to API discovery, I'm talking about using <a href="http://pending.webschemas.org/WebAPI">the pending WebAPI class</a>, but I'm also talking about using common Schema.org org within API definitions--something that will open the definitions to discovery because it employs a common schema. I am also talking about how do we leverage this vocabulary in our HTML pages, <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/intro-structured-data">helping search engines like Google understand there is an API service available</a>:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/4fd35c3a5ab20881f86283bc001137ab.js"></script>
<p>I&nbsp;will also be exploring how I can better leverage Schema.org in <a href="http://apisjson.org">my APIs.json&nbsp;format</a>, better leveraging a common vocabulary describing API operations, not just an individual API. I'm looking to expand the opportunities for discovering, not limit them. I would love all APIs to take a page from the hypermedia playbook, and have a machine readable index for each API, with a set of links present with each response, but I also want folks to learn about APIs through Google, ensuring they are indexed in a way that search engines can comprehend.</p>
<p>When it comes to <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">API discovery</a> I am primarily invested in APIs.json (because it's my baby) describing API operations, and <a href="https://www.openapis.org/">OpenAPI</a> to describe the surface area of an API, but I also want this to map to the very SEO driven world we operate in right now. I will keep investing time in helping folks use Schema.org in their API definitions (APIs.json&nbsp;&amp; OpenAPI), but I will also start investing in folks employing JSON+LD and Schema.org as part of their search engine strategies (like above), making our APIs more discoverable to humans as well as other systems.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-connection.png" alt="" width="30%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I saw an interesting chasm emerge while at a Google Community Summit this last week, while I heard their support team talk, as well as their developer relations team discuss what they were up to. During the discussion, one of the companies presents discussed how their overall experience with the developer relations team has been amazing, their experience with support has widely been a pretty bad experience--revealing a potential gap between the two teams.</p>
<p>This is a pretty common gap I've seen with many other API platforms. The developer relations team is all about getting the word out, and encouraging platform usage&nbsp;and support teams are there to be the front line for support&nbsp;and being the buffer between integration, and platform engineering teams. I've been the person in the role as the evangelist when there is a bug in an API, and I'm at the mercy of an already overloaded engineering team, and QA staff, before anything gets resolved--this is a difficult position to be in.</p>
<p>How wide this chasm becomes ultimately depends on how much of a priority the API is for an engineering team, and how overloaded they are. I've worked on projects where this chasm is pretty wide, taking days, even weeks to get bugs fixed. I'm guessing this is something a more DevOps&nbsp;focused approach to the API life cycle might help with, where an API developer relations and support team have more access to making changes&nbsp;and fixing bugs--something that has to be pretty difficult to deal with at Google scale.</p>
<p>Anyways, I thought the potential chasm between developer relations and support was worthy&nbsp;enough to discuss and include in my research. It is something we all should be considering no matter how big or small our operations are. There is no quicker way to kill the morale of your API developer relations and support teams by allowing a canyon like this to persist. What challenges have you experienced when it comes to getting support from your API provider? Or inversely, what challenges have you faced supporting your APIs or executing on your developer outreach strategy? I'm curious if other folks are feeling this same pain.</p>

<p>In 2017 <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/01/10/hoping-schema-becomes-just-as-important-as-api-definitions-in-2017/">I think that getting our act together when it comes to our data&nbsp;schema</a> will prove to be just as important as getting it together when it comes to our API definitions and design. This is one reason I'm such a big fan of using OpenAPI to define our APIs because it allows us to better organize the schema of the data included as part of the API request and response structure. So I am happy to see <a href="http://blog.getpostman.com/2017/02/28/introducing-the-new-data-editor/">Postman announce their new data editor</a>, something I'm hoping will help us make sense of the schema we are using throughout our API operations.</p>
<p>The Postman data editor provides us with some pretty slick data management UI features including&nbsp;drag and drop, a wealth of useful keyboard shortcuts, bulk actions, and other timesaving features. Postman has gone a long way to inject awareness into how we are using APIs over the last couple of years, and the data editor will only continue developing this awareness when it comes to the data we are passing back and forth. Lord knows&nbsp;we need all the help we can get&nbsp;when it comes to getting our data backends in order.</p>
<p>The Postman data editor makes me happy, but I'm most optimistic about what it will enable, and what Postman has planned as part of their roadmap. They end their announcement with <em>"we</em><span><em>&nbsp;have a LOT of new feature releases planned to build on top of this editor, capabilities inspired by things you already do </em>using<em>&nbsp;spreadsheets"</em>. For me, this points to some features that would directly map to the most ubiquitous data tools out there--the spreadsheet. With a significant&nbsp;portion of business in the world is done via spreadsheets, it makes the concept of integration into the API toolchain a pretty compelling thing.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/2017/03/07/visual-studio-2017-productivity-performance-and-partners/">I was reviewing the latest changes with Visual Studio 2017</a>&nbsp;and came across the section introducing connected services, providing a glimpse of Microsoft APIs baked into the integrated development environment (IDE). <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/06/18/integrated-development-environment-ide-for-apis/">I've been pushing for more API availability in IDE's for some time now</a>, something that is not new, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/03/expanding-the-layer-of-api-discovery-from-within-the-developers-ide/">with Google and SalesForce having done it for a while</a>, but is something I haven't seen any significant movement in for a while now.</p>
<p>I have talked about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/27/apisjson-driven-api-dictionaries-for-use-in-atom-ide-autocomplete-packages/">delivering APIs in Atom using APIs.json</a>, and have <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/08/19/bing-developer-assistant-for-visual-studio-delivers-relevant-api-code/">long hoped Microsoft would move forward with this in Visual Studio</a>. All APIs should be discoverable from within any IDE, it just makes sense as a frontline for API discovery, especially when we are talking about developers. Microsoft's approach focuses on connecting developers of&nbsp;mobile applications, with <em>"the first Connected Service we are providing for mobile developers enables you to connect your app to an Azure App Service backend, providing easy access to authentication, push notifications, and data storage with online/offline sync".</em></p>
<p><span>In the picture, you can see Office 365 APIs, but since I don't have Visual Studio I can't explore this any further. If you have any insight into these new connected services features in the IDE, please let me know your thoughts and experiences. If Microsoft was smart, all their APIs would be seamlessly integrated into Visual Studio, as well as allow developers to easily import any other API using OpenAPI, or Postman Collections.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>While I think that IDEs are still relevant to the API development life cycle I feel like maybe there is a reason IDEs haven't caught up in this area. It feels like a need that API lifecycle tooling like <a href="http://getpostman.com">Postman</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://restlet.com/modules/client/">Restlet Client</a>, and <a href="http://stoplight.io">Stoplight</a> are stepping up to service the area. Regardless I will keep an eye on. It seems likno-braineriner for Microsoft to make their APIs available via their own IDE products, but maybe we are headed for a different future where a new breed of tools helps us more easily integrate APIs into our applications--no code necessary.</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2017_03_12_at_9.16.57_pm.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was learning more about <a href="http://www.grpc.io/">gRPC</a> from the Google team last week, while at the Google Community Summit, as well as the API Craft SF Meetup. I'm still learning about gRPC, and how it contributes to the API conversation, so I am trying to share what I learn as I go, keeping a record for others to learn from&nbsp;along the way. One thing I wanted to better understand was something I kept hearing regarding gRPC delivering more of a tighter API contract between API provider and consumer.</p>
<p>In contrast to more RESTful APIs, a gRPC client has to be generated by the provider. First, you define a service in a .proto file (aka Protocol Buffer), then you generate client code using the protocol buffer compiler. Where client SDKs are up for debate in the world of RESTful APIs, and client generation might even be frowned upon in some circles, when it comes to gRPC APIs, client generation is a requirement--dictating a much&nbsp;tighter coupling and contract, between API provider and consumer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not have the first-hand experience with this process yet, I am just learning from my discussions last week, and trying to understand how gRPC is different from the way we've been doing APIs using a RESTful approach. So far it seems like you might want to consider gRPC if you are looking for significant levels of performance from your APIs, in situations where you have a tighter relationship with your consumers, such as internal, or partner scenarios. gRPC requires a tighter API contract between provider and consumer, something that might not always be possible, depending on the situation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While I'm still getting up to speed, it seems to me that the .proto file, or the protocol buffer definition acts as the language for this API contract. Similar to how <a href="http://openapis.org">OpenAPI is quickly becoming a contract for more RESTful API</a>s, although it is often times much looser contract. I'll keep investing time into learning about gRP, but. I wanted to make sure and process what I've learned leading up to, and while at Google this last week. I'm not convinced yet that gRPC is the future of APIs, but I am getting more convinced <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/03/10/focus-on-having-a-robust-and-diverse-api-toolbox/">that it is another important tool in our API toolbox</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/schema-org/schema-org.png" alt="" width="30%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was following <a href="https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/pull/1445">the discussion around adding a&nbsp;WebAPI class</a> to Schema.org's core vocabulary, and it got me to think more about the role Schema.org has to play with not just our API definitions, but also significantly influencing API discovery. Meaning that we should be using Schema.org as part of our OpenAPI definitions, providing us with a common vocabulary for communicating around our APIs, but also empowering the discovery of APIs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I describe the relationship between Schema.org to API discovery, I'm talking about using <a href="http://pending.webschemas.org/WebAPI">the pending WebAPI class</a>, but I'm also talking about using common Schema.org org within API definitions--something that will open the definitions to discovery because it employs a common schema. I am also talking about how do we leverage this vocabulary in our HTML pages, <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/intro-structured-data">helping search engines like Google understand there is an API service available</a>:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/4fd35c3a5ab20881f86283bc001137ab.js"></script>
<p>I&nbsp;will also be exploring how I can better leverage Schema.org in <a href="http://apisjson.org">my APIs.json&nbsp;format</a>, better leveraging a common vocabulary describing API operations, not just an individual API. I'm looking to expand the opportunities for discovering, not limit them. I would love all APIs to take a page from the hypermedia playbook, and have a machine readable index for each API, with a set of links present with each response, but I also want folks to learn about APIs through Google, ensuring they are indexed in a way that search engines can comprehend.</p>
<p>When it comes to <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">API discovery</a> I am primarily invested in APIs.json (because it's my baby) describing API operations, and <a href="https://www.openapis.org/">OpenAPI</a> to describe the surface area of an API, but I also want this to map to the very SEO driven world we operate in right now. I will keep investing time in helping folks use Schema.org in their API definitions (APIs.json&nbsp;&amp; OpenAPI), but I will also start investing in folks employing JSON+LD and Schema.org as part of their search engine strategies (like above), making our APIs more discoverable to humans as well as other systems.</p>

<p>I spent last week in San Francisco listening to Google's very machine learning focused view of the future. In addition to their Google Next conference, I spent Tuesday at the Google Community Summit, getting an analyst look at what they are up to. Machine Learning (ML) was definitely playing a significant role in their strategy, and I heard a lot talk of machine learning marketplaces.</p>
<p>Beyond their own ML offerings like <a href="https://cloud.google.com/video-intelligence/">video intelligence</a> and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/">vision APIs</a>, Google also provides you with <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/big-data/2016/09/google-cloud-machine-learning-now-open-to-all-with-new-professional-services-and-education-programs">an engine for publishing your own ML models</a>. They also have a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/asl/">machine learning advanced solution lab</a>, throwing a <a href="https://cloudplatformonline.com/Machine-Learning-Startup-Competition.html">machine learning hackathon</a>, and pushing a <a href="http://cloud.google.com/certification">machine learning certification program</a>&nbsp;as part of their cloud and data offerings. As the Google machine learning roadmap was being discussed throughout the day, the question of where can I publish my ML models, and begin selling them, came up regularly--something I feel like is going to be a common theme of the 2017 ML hype.</p>
<p>I'm guessing we will see a relationship between the Google ML engine, Google Cloud Endpoints emerge, and eventually some sort of ML marketplace like we have with <a href="https://algorithmia.com/">Algorithmia</a>. We are already seeing this shift in the AWS landscape, between their Lambda, ML, API Gateway, and AWS Marketplace offerings. You see hints of the future in <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/02/28/the-aws-serverless-api-portal/">the AWS serverless API portal</a> I wrote about previously. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/01/03/exploring-the-economics-of-wholesale-and-retail-algorithmic-apis/">The technology, business, and politics of providing retail and wholesale access to algorithms and machine learning models in this way fascinates me</a>, but as with every other successful area of the API economy, about 90% of this will be shit, and 10% will be actually doing anything interesting with compute&nbsp;and APIs.</p>
<p><a href="http://algorithmic.rotoscope.work/2017/01/03/learning-about-machine-learning-apis-with-my-algorithmic-rotoscope-work/">I'm doing all my image and video texture transfer machine learning model training using AWS and Algorithmia</a>. I then use Algorithmia to get access to the models I've trained, and if I ever want to open up partner level (wholesale), or public (retail) access to my ML Models I will use Algorithmia, or an API facade on top of their API to open up access, and make available in the <a href="https://algorithmia.com/algorithms">Algorithmia ML marketplace</a>. I'm guessing at some point I will want to syndicate my models into other marketplace environments, with giants like Google and AWS, but also other more niche, specialty ML marketplaces, where I can reach exactly the audience I want.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-dna.png" alt="" width="30%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I've been simmering on thoughts around Uber's greyballing&nbsp;for some time now, where they target regulators and police in different cities, and craft a special Uber experience just for them. Targeting users like this are not new, all companies do it, it's just that Uber has a whole array of troubling behavior going on, and the fact that they were so aggressively pushing back on regulators, is why this is such a news story.</p>
<p>I'm familiar with this concept because greyballing is embedded in the DNA of APIs, we just call it API management. Every web, mobile, and device that uses an API have a unique fingerprint, identifying the application, as well as the user. Not all apps&nbsp;or users are created equal, and everyone gets's a tailored experience. I wanted to explore the spectrum of experiences I see on a regular basis, helping us all understand how this broadway production works.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Greyballing</strong> - Uber's situation is focused on creating a special scenario for regulators, but many companies also do this for their competitors, and anyone they see as a threat. Smoke and mirrors for those who threaten you is the name of the game.</li>
<li><strong>Sales Funnel -</strong> Where are you in my sales funnel? Based upon your application or user fingerprint, and IP address you will receive a different experience, support, and access to resources--the bigger opportunity you are, the better experience you will get.</li>
<li><strong>Country</strong> - Due to laws in specific countries, platforms have to deliver a different experience based upon the country, and region an application and user are operating within.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Virtualization</strong> - We regularly create sandboxes, staging, and alternate means of providing an environment for applications and users to operate in, delivering a more virtualized experience, based upon platform objectives.</li>
<li><strong>Analytics</strong> - Dashboards, analytics, and other visualizations provide us with snapshots of our world. These metrics, KPIs, analytics, visualizations, and other reporting drive everything, even when companies like Facebook and Twitter misreport and inflate their numbers.</li>
<li><strong>Rate Limiting - </strong>Access to data, content, media&nbsp;and algorithms online is always logged and metered. What you have access to, and how much&nbsp;you can use is always limited--something that usually occurs silently behind the apps we are using, protecting the interests of the platform.</li>
<li><strong>Error Rates -</strong> In response to rate limiting, or possibly because you are a special regulator or competitor you may be receiving elevated error rates. On mobile devices, it is easy to blame this on the network, but your elevated error rates may be more about who you are than the cell service where you are located.</li>
<li><strong>Access Tiers -</strong> The experience you are getting is the one you have paid for. Depending on what we can afford, we will get a different experience within an application--with all levels of access, and experience available to me the consumer.</li>
<li><strong>Partner Tiers -</strong> You only gain access to this experience because you are a partner. Only our trusted, approved partners have access to the full experience. While also letting everyone else know what it takes to become a partner.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Personalization</strong> - We are tailoring a unique experience for each user based on their interests, location, friends, activity, and a wealth of other data points. Each user of our platform gets their own experience, allowing the algorithm to define a personalized experience for each human.</li>
<li><strong>Transparency</strong> - You are given a look into the kitchen, and are shown how the algorithm is working (or not). Helping be more transparent about the technology, business, and politics of the experience you are receiving.</li>
<li><strong>Observability</strong> - In addition to having a window to look in, there are machine readable / defined inputs and outputs that allow for the experience to be measured and quantified, providing some accountability to the transparency.</li>
<li><strong>Communication</strong> - What we hear is in alignment with the experience. When we are told to expect a certain experience we receive it. There is no surprises&nbsp;or mysterious behavior in the application experience for any user, and all expectations are in alignment with marketing and other communication.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many acceptable forms of greyballing. The problem isn't the technology and experience delivered. It was the motivations behind each company doing it. These things don't always happen as the result of malicious intent as we saw with Uber either. In the majority of the cases, it is just incompetence and greed that are the driving forces. <span>Platform engineers are good at being hyper-focused on a single objective, and being totally oblivious to the negative and unforeseen consequences</span>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Uber we know this was intentional when it happens with Facebook and Twitter misreporting their numbers, things can be much cloudier. Did they do it intentionally? Or did they just get caught? There really is no holy grail for ensuring tech companies behave with virtualization, personalization, greyballing, or whatever you want to call it. We live in a world where nothing is real, and everything is meant to be fabricated, and tailored just for us--it is what everyone seems to be asking for, wanting, or at least blindly accepting.</p>
<p>This will all come down to transparency, observability, and communication. If a company is doing shady things with their platform, there really is no fool proof way of knowing. We only can depend on them being transparent and communicating, or we can push for more access to the inputs and outputs of the platform, in hopes of gaining more observability. Beyond that, I guess whistleblowers is the last line of defense against this kind of behavior, which is pretty much how we are learning so much about Uber's motivations and internal culture.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Mar 2017</span>
        <p>I am spending time learning more about what <a href="https://www.airmap.com">Airmap</a> is doing with their <a href="https://www.airmap.com/stakeholders/">digital notice and awareness system</a>. I first <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/05/airmap-is-positioning-itself-to-be-a-critical-api-broker-for-the-drone-industry/">learned about what Airmap was up to when I learned they&nbsp;were behind the notifications of national parks, and forest fires</a> that displayed via the iPhone enabled radio controller for my <a href="https://www.dji.com/phantom-3-pro">DJI Phantom 3 Pro drone</a>. I found it to be a pretty slick way to&nbsp;notify me of issues with the drone, my radio signal, and the environment around me, so when I came back to civilization I set out researching more about what Airmap does, staying in tune with what they are up to ever since.</p>
<p>Now, Airmap's&nbsp;digital notice and awareness system caught my attention: <em>AirMap&rsquo;s Digital Notice &amp; Awareness System works by sending an encrypted digital flight notice from a drone operator to a secure airspace management dashboard accessible by airspace authorities. </em>Moving this beyond just the drone operator getting notifications about device or environmental conditions based upon my latitude, longitude, and elevation. This system allows for an event driven notification system to be put in place between drone operator(s) and the cloud, modeling an airplane flight control system, but for the drone universe.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.airmap.com/stakeholders/"><img style="padding: 3px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2017_03_12_at_5.33.25_pm.png" alt="" width="98%" align="center" /></a></p>
<p>For me, this is just one possible control system for drones--a cloud, mobile, and device based flight control system. I'm thinking about movie production, agricultural, mining, disaster, and many other types of control systems.<a href="https://developers.airmap.com/"> Airmap&nbsp;provides you with some of the APIs you will need to develop a drone platform and/or application(s) that will deliver in these areas</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.airmap.com/reference#status-api-overview">Status API</a></strong> - Provide nearby airspace information, including advisories, and notice requirements.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developers.airmap.com/reference#airspace-api-overview">Airspace API</a></strong> - Interact with the surrounding airspace including its obstacles, rules, and requirements.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developers.airmap.com/reference#flight-api-overview">Flight API</a></strong> - Create and query flights, verify a pilot meets flight requirements, and provide digital notice.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.airmap.com/reference#pilot-api-overview">Pilot API</a></strong> - Manage a pilot's profile, preferences, and provide identity verification.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.airmap.com/reference#aircraft-api-overview">Aircraft API</a></strong> - Information about drone manufacturers, models, and metadata.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developers.airmap.com/reference#vector-tiles">Maps</a></strong> - Provides a TileJSON spec map style for use with MapBox GL.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm taking these APIs and including them in my drone API research. Next, I'm taking what I've learned about machine learning and API enabled cloud pipelines and get to working mapping out some of the common blueprints for video production pipelines, and data processing workflows. I am looking to identify some common ways that AWS and Google cloud infrastructure can be seamlessly mapped to Airmap, and other drone enablement solutions--providing the next generation digital notice and awareness systems like Airmap is doing.</p>
<p>I am enjoying staying in tune where Airmap is headed with their platform. They have identified a very interesting and important layer to the emerging world of drones. Providing the API for tracking for airspace, aircraft, pilots, and their flights is a super smart approach to providing APIs, as well as leading the charge when it comes to information, advisories, and notices in the real world where drones are operating. This space fascinates me, as well as the production, and post-production API enablement when it comes to processing the video, images, and data these fascinating devices generate.&nbsp;</p>

        <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-connect-the-dots.png" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p>I spend a lot of time connecting the dots with APIs, trying to understand what resources are available via an API, and then how I can actually put them to use. I can usually land the documentation page of an API, and be up to speed about what resources are available, and have a basic level of understanding of how I can put the APIs to work withing 15 minutes--if the API is reasonably designed, and somewhat documented. Where things get tougher for meÂ and require much heavier of a cognitive load, is going from the basicsÂ to understanding what is possible when you can really connect the dots between all the APIs a provider makes available.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/02/27/an-example-of-an-api-service-provider-using-hypermedia/">While I was profiling, and learning more about the AWS API Gateway</a>, which is an API that let's you deploy and manage your APIs, I found that their usage of the hypermedia format HAL, significantly contributed to me going from basicsÂ to aÂ better understanding the big picture, and what is possible at scale. Each API path I learned about gave me a wealth of links describing what was possible next, providing details on what I should be doing next, perpetually introducing and teaching me about what is possible with the AWS API Gateway.</p>
<p>I am hyper aware of the cost of getting up and running using an API. As a one person shop, reviewing thousands of APIs, my time is precious. I've looked at all of the AWS APIs, and it's easy to get a basic understanding of the resources available with their classic action= approach, but I rarely ever see the big picture of what is possible with the API. After spending the same amount of time in the AWS Gateway API as I would have spent learning any of the other AWS APIs, I found that I had a much greater understanding of what was possible, due to the presence of the hypermedia design pattern.</p>
<p>Hypermedia provides a much more complete story for me, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/10/18/a-more-honest-and-flexible-api-contract-using-hypermedia/">as well as offering up a much more honest approach to supporting the API</a>. It doesn't just provide me with documentation of available API resources, it connects the dots for me, showing me what is possible. In this scenario, it is an API deployment and management API, so while I'm learning about the API, I'm also being introduced toÂ new API deployment and management concepts along the way. We shouldn't assume that all of our consumers will be able to connect the dots, we should be providing them withÂ a more complete story of what is possible with the API design patterns we choose.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-toolbox.jpg" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I'm learning a lot about HTTP/2 and gRPC this week, so I have been thinking about how we isolate ourselves by focusing in on individual toolsets, where we should really be expanding our horizons, helping ensure we have the most robust and diverse API toolbox we possibly can. Depending on what part of the tech universe an engineer comes from they'll have a different view on just exactly what I mean when I say API to them.</p>
<p>The most common perspective that people respond with is REST. Folks automatically think this is what I mean when I say API--it isn't. That is your dogma&nbsp;or your gullibility to other people's dogma--please expand your horizons. When I say APIs, I mean an application programming interface that leverages web technology (aka HTTP, HTTP/2). Sure REST is the dominating philosophy in this discussion, but I see no benefit in limiting ourselves in this fashion--I see API as a toolbox, with the following toolsets:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>REST</strong> - Considering Roy Fielding's&nbsp;guidance when it comes to leveraging HTTP in my API design.</li>
<li><strong>Hypermedia</strong> - Considering the web, and the role that links can play in your API design.</li>
<li><strong>Webhooks</strong> - Helping keep APIs a two-way street, expanding your API to respond to events not just single requests.</li>
<li><strong>GraphQL</strong> - Helping put powerful query tooling in the hands of API consumers when working with large and complex datasets.</li>
<li><strong>gRPC</strong> - Acknowledging that the HTTP protocol is evolving, and our API contract can evolve along with the specification.</li>
</ul>
<p>This represents the major toolsets that are currently in my API toolbox. Sure there are a number of other individual tools and specifications in there as well, but this represents the top tier toolsets I am looking at when it comes to getting things done. In my opinion, there is a time and place for each of these toolsets to be put to use. I can easily geek out on any of these areas, but because I'm not selling you a product or service, I'm more interested in finding the right tool for the situation.</p>
<p>I do not expect that all providers have this robust of API toolbox from day one--it is something that will come with time. My recommendation is everyone begins with REST, developing proficiency in this domain, while you are also learning about hypermedia webhooks. As your understanding evolves, then you should start looking at GraphQL, gRPC, and other more advanced approaches to round off your skills. Do not let your religious technological beliefs or any single vendor motivations limit the scope of your API toolbox, you should be working to make it as robust and diverse as you possibly can.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/managing_grpc_apis_with_google_cloud_endpoints_3_638.jpg" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I have been learning more about the way Google designs and defines their APIs after <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/03/03/google-shares-their-api-design-guide/">their release of their API design guide</a>. When I research a company's APIs I always spend time looking through their Github repositories for anything interesting, and while poking around in Google's I found a repository of "<a href="https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis">interface definitions for a small (but growing) set of Google APIs</a>". I keep track of any Github repo I find containing API definitions, but Google's repo stood out because it contained a set of API definitions that covered both APIs that support both REST and gRPC.</p>
<p>Straight from the Github repo, they support two ways of access APIs: <em>"Google APIs use&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/google/protobuf">Protocol Buffers</a>&nbsp;version 3 (proto3) as their Interface Definition Language (IDL) to define the API interface and the structure of the payload messages. The same interface definition is used for both REST and RPC versions of the API, which can be accessed over different wire protocols."</em></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>JSON over HTTP: You can access Google APIs directly using JSON over HTTP, using&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.google.com/api-client-libraries">Google API client libraries&nbsp;</a>or third-party API client libraries.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Protocol Buffers over gRPC: You can access Google APIs published in this repository through&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/grpc">GRPC</a>, which is a high-performance binary RPC protocol over HTTP/2. It offers many useful features, including request/response multiplex and full-duplex streaming.</em></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the first example of this I've seen in the wild, and it feels like we are shifting from an HTTP to an HTTP/2&nbsp;API world. I don't think regular old REST or web APIs are going anywhere, I think they'll continue to be a staple, but it looks like Google is laying the groundwork for two-speed APIs, that are defined using a common API definition--you pick the speed you need. I've been hearing tales of gRPC usage for a while and seeing more APIs defined using protocol buffers, but Google's approach signals a wider more significant shift for me.</p>
<p>I'm still learning about gRPC, so I can't quite visualize the overlap between&nbsp;gRPC and REST quite yet. I'm going through their API definitions because they provide an interesting snapshot of the surface area of these hybrid APIs. As I spend my week in San Francisco for Google Next, I'm eager to learn more about their evolving approach to designing and defining APIs--something that I think will be setting the tone for API design at scale in the near future.</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/bw_onion.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I read a lot of content about APIs. I read a lot of redundant and fluffy marketing and technical jargon, trying to understand exactly what an API does, or doesn't do. Before I criticize, I have to admit that crafting really good API marketing and documentation is hard. Only about 5% of what I read is good, a significant portion is just incomplete and lazily done by someone who doesn't care--the rest is actually incorrect, misleading, and straight up hype.</p>
<p>There are three layers to the API hype onion in my experience:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Marketing - </strong>The fluff on the main page written by the marketing team who usually doesn't care about the API and has taken the time to get to know what it does.</li>
<li><strong>Documentation - </strong>The technical fluff in the API portal usually written by someone technical, and not quite possessing the skills to talk to humans, let alone coherently explain something to another human being.</li>
<li><strong>API -</strong> The actual naming, ordering, parameters, and overall request and response structure for an API that actually accomplishes something--it may not always accomplish exactly what I'm looking for, but at least it is.</li>
</ul>
<p>While I still read marketing&nbsp;and documentation, because they provide me with clues about the intent behind API operations, when I actually want the honest take of what an API does, I always go straight to the API and get to work making API calls. This is a problem that is only increasing as we enter into the artificial intelligence and machine learning hype phase.</p>
<p>After you finish writing the marketing, documentation, and have your API up and running--step back, and re-read everything, and think about the synchronicity between these three areas of your operations. It takes a lot of practice&nbsp;and hard work to do right, but I think if you just take a moment, step back, and think about these layers to how you articulate what your APIs does--you will immediately find yourself in a better position to communicate what it is you are trying to accomplish to a much wider audience.</p>

<p>I always enjoy learning about how companies are versioning their APIs. The topic is always one of the most discussed areas when we do APIStrat workshops, and is an aspect of the API space that I think there is never a 100% right way of doing things. Making it an area I recommend learning as many different approaches as you can, then decide on the right solution for your particular situation.</p>
<p>To help you in your journey, and mine, I try to document any official versioning strategies published by API providers I research. Today I have one from Google, providing some very interesting insight into how they version their APIs. Google uses&nbsp;<a href="http://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a>, which follows this approach to each version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, incrementing the:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>MAJOR</code>&nbsp;version when you make incompatible API changes,</li>
<li><code>MINOR</code>&nbsp;version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner,</li>
<li><code>PATCH</code>&nbsp;version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.</li>
</ol>
<p>When it comes to their REST APIs Google puts the version in URL, and I'm still learning more about their approach to how it's applied to the proto package for gRPC APIs. They also have some good advice when it comes to what is breaking and non-breaking changes.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-broken-gears.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></p>
<p>Backwards-compatible (non-breaking) changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding an API interface to an API service definition</li>
<li>Adding a method to an API interface</li>
<li>Adding an HTTP binding to a method</li>
<li>Adding a field to a request message</li>
<li>Adding a field to a response message</li>
<li>Adding a value to an enum</li>
<li>Adding an output-only resource field</li>
</ul>
<p>Backwards-incompatible (breaking) changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removing or renaming a service, field, method or enum value</li>
<li>Changing an HTTP binding</li>
<li>Changing the type of a field</li>
<li>Changing a resource name format</li>
<li>Changing visible behavior of existing requests</li>
<li>Changing the URL format in the HTTP definition</li>
<li>Adding a read/write field to a resource message</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/versioning">This Google API versioning advice comes from their API design guide</a>. I also f<a href="https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/versioning-an-api">ound some versioning advice from them as part of the Google Cloud Endpoints documentation</a>, which provides some easier to follow advice for REST APIs. It also includes some advice for handling as part of your OpenAPI definition, something I will be investigating further.</p>
<p>I am just looking to add semantic versioning approach, the example of putting the version in the URL, and the advice on backwards-compatibility to my API research. It helps me keep my work full of healthy examples, and URL references to how specific API providers are documenting their own APIs, as well as offering guidance to customers who are using their services to design, deploy, and manage their APIs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Mar 2017</span>
        <p>This is the third post in my effort to try and define the three sides of my API monitoring. I'm trying to quantify what is needed as a sort of API industry monitoring dashboard -- if there is such a thing. To help me think through this, I have taken my approach to monitoring the API space and I'm breaking them up into three buckets <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/02/16/trying-to-define-api-awareness/">API awareness</a>, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/02/28/a-checklist-for-api-observability/">API observability</a>, and now API ratings. While the three areas share many common characteristics, the motivations behind each area are significantly different--enough so, I want to look at them and evolve them separately.</p>
<p>A rating system for the API space is something I usually get one or two requests to discuss each quarter, sustained throughout the year. I have very different actors approaching me to solve this, from hedge fund managers, to venture capital managers, to startups and enterprise organizations. Everyone (except one) who has approached me to date has been woefully unaware of the scope of doing something like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/10/31/how-are-we-going-to-create-the-standard-and-poors-and-moodys-for-the-api-economy/">creating a Standard and Poors or Moody's for the API economy</a>, which is always a red flag for me when it comes to understanding their motivations.</p>
<p>I do not have the resources to develop an API ranking system on my own, and I have no desire to exclusively own such a thing--it needs to be an open, community driven thing. However, I do have interest it trying to define possible algorithms for such a ranking system, derived from the approach I've developed for myself. I am driving this work from <a href="http://apievangelist.com">a master dump of my research,</a> and the approach I have used to track on in the world of APIs since 2010--an analyst 100K view, and here is what I'm considering...</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discovery -&nbsp;</strong>If we are rating APIs, they need to be discoverable, and accessible--if you can't find them, understand what they do, and kick the tires--you really can't rate something. How many APIs? What is churn?
<ul>
<li><strong>Applications</strong>&nbsp;- Find new applications built on top of APIs.</li>
<li><strong>People</strong>&nbsp;- People who are doing interesting things with APIs.</li>

<li><strong>Tools</strong>&nbsp;- Open source tools that put APIs to work solving a problem.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Versions -&nbsp;</strong>What versions are currently in use, what new versions are available, but not used, and what future versions are planned and on the horizon. What is the time since the last release, or between releases?</li>
<li><strong>Paths</strong>&nbsp;- What paths are available for all available APIs, and what are changes or additions to this stack of resources.</li>
<li><strong>Schema&nbsp;</strong>- What schema are available as part of the request and response structure for APIs, and available as part of the underlying data model(s) being used. What are the changes?</li>
<li><strong>SDKs</strong>&nbsp;- What SDKs are available for the APIs I'm monitoring. What is new. What are the changes made regarding programming and platform develop kits?

<li><strong>Contributors</strong>&nbsp;- Who are the contributors.</li>

<li><strong>Forks</strong>&nbsp;- The number of forks on an SDK.</li>

</ul>
<p>I use data and make gut-level decisions from these areas across my monitoring of the space. Some of these signals are directly within the control of API providers, while others are more in control of their consumers, and the wider public. Many of these signals depend on a company, organization, institutions, and government agencies being public with their API operations. I just can't know about and measure private, internal APIs, without some sort of observability into their operations.</p>
<p>The most obvious areas for measuring the quality of API providers have been based on the&nbsp;number of users, or the&nbsp;number of API calls, which are both completely within the control of the API provider to report, or not to report. My approach to rating APIs is dependent on <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/02/16/trying-to-define-api-awareness/">my API awareness</a>, as well as <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/02/28/a-checklist-for-api-observability/">the API observability</a> of each API&nbsp;provider. This is why I am working my way through these three levels, trying to take another look at how to distil down what I do into a set of metrics that can be used to establish some sort of rating for each provider.</p>
<p>I actually have metrics in place for about 25% of this list, and I know other API service providers who have an additional 10% of this, but really there is a pretty big opportunity out there right now for an organization (or organizations) to step up in the area of API ratings. The challenge is going to be about how you are going to keep the money from influencing the rating system, or I guess to be as transparent as possible in how you take money from the people you are rating, and how the process works. Let me know if you want to talk about in detail, I'm looking to stimulate this conversation further in 2017.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Mar 2017</span>
        <p>I just wanted to take a moment and highlight some folks who are doing interesting things with APIs. I spend a lot of time focusing on the companies, products, and services from&nbsp;the sector, but I don't talk a lot about individual people. So I wanted to pause for a moment and just highlight a couple of people doing really interesting things with APIs right now.</p>
<p>If have been paying attention to API definitions in the last year, then you probably have come across APIs.guru, <a href="https://apis.guru/openapi-directory/">the Wikipedia for APIs</a>. They have 244 OpenAPI definitions available in their catalog, which&nbsp;is the most comprehensive directory of machine readable API definitions out there. If you have an OpenAPI for your API you should be <a href="https://apis.guru/browse-apis/">publishing it to APIs.guru</a>. if you don't, you should be creating one, and then publishing it to APIs.guru.</p>
<p>Here are the hardworking, API-savvy folks behind APIs.guru:</p>

<p>I am in the middle of a project where I am building on the work these two have invested in with APIs.guru. I'm hoping that with the next wave of this work, I'll have some complete API definitions I can contribute to APIs.guru. I encourage you to make sure your API definitions are published to the directory so that other people like me can include your APIs in our work.</p>
<p class="p2">Beyond the APIs.guru directory, <a href="https://github.com/APIs-guru/openapi-directory">I recommend checking out their Github repository, as they are doing some interesting things with GraphQL</a>. If you need help crafting an API definition for your API platform, or in need of other API advice, I recommend messaging the APIs.guru team. I'm sure they'd be happy to talk to you, and see where they can help you with your API efforts.</p>

<p><em>This is an outline I pulled together for a potential project I am working on this week. It's derived from my research, and previous workshops I've done with companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies in the past. I wanted to share here, in hopes it would stimulate API-focused conversations with some interesting folks.</em></p>
<p>I put together a framework to guide a full day discussion between us, which will leave you with a greater awareness of what an API focus can bring to your company, and leave you with a strategy that you could apply to your API operations back home. This framework is assembled from the last seven years of monitoring the API practices of leading companies like Amazon, Google, Facebook, Twitter, and others, but tailored to meet the needs of a retail and digital commerce focused company. I don't expect you to digest everything here in a single reading, it is the complete list of building blocks which we will move around, and organize in a guide for you to take back with you.</p>
<p><strong>API 101<br /></strong>I wanted to start with the basics&nbsp;and help provide you and your organization grasp the fundamental concepts of why having an API focus is important to doing business in 2017. It is important that all stakeholders have a base level awareness of the what and why of APIs are, as well as the technical, business, and legal implications of API operations. Here is an outline for our discussion:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What Is API?&nbsp;</strong>- Discuss your overall web strategy, and discuss how your API operations will augment, complement, and extend your web presence.</li>
<li><strong>Why do API?&nbsp;</strong>- Cover why APIs will help you deliver to web and mobile, as well as bring more flexibility in any&nbsp;system to system integrations internally, and with your partners.</li>
<li><strong>API Consumption</strong>&nbsp;- Talk about the current and future consumption of 3rd party APIs&nbsp;and from trusted partners, as well as thoughts about internal usage.</li>
<li><strong>Providing APIs&nbsp;</strong>- Talk about the overall world of providing APIs, alongside your existing web and mobile application development.</li>
<li><strong>The Technology of APIs</strong>&nbsp;- Briefly talk about the technological building blocks of providing and consuming APIs, without getting too much into the weeds.</li>
<li><strong>The Business of APIs&nbsp;</strong>- Discuss the nuances of how APIs are being monetized when it comes to retail and products, as well as approaches to data, and other resources.</li>
<li><strong>The Politics of APIs&nbsp;</strong>- Makes sure to highlight many of common legal, privacy, security, transparency, and other political aspects of API operations.</li>
<li><strong>API Operations&nbsp;</strong>- Discuss the final product of our gathering, assembling a strategy for your API operations that can be implemented in phases, and growing with successes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before we dive into the details of modern API operations I want to make sure we have a solid base for understanding why your company should be investing APIs. Then we can talk about what else will be needed to do this successfully.</p>
<p><strong>Definitions<br /></strong>Before we get started, let's define the building blocks of doing APIs, starting with the high-level objectives of why your company is looking to do APIs. Then we will move from the 100K level, and identify some of the common building blocks we'll use to define API operations across all the working areas below.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Objectives&nbsp;</strong>- Get to work defining the primary objectives of your&nbsp;company-wide API operations.</li>
<li><strong>Web Concepts&nbsp;</strong>- Discuss the core elements of the web, and how they are reused for APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Web Standards</strong>&nbsp;- Walk through a handful of the common standards employed as part of API operations.</li>
<li><strong>Data Schema</strong>&nbsp;- Talk about how data is defined, managed, shared, and monetized using APIs.</li>
<li><strong>API Definitions</strong>&nbsp;- Introduce you to common ways in which APIs are being defined and communicated around.</li>
<li><strong>Access Scopes</strong>&nbsp;- Talk through the myriad of ways in which data, content, and other resources are accessed.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these areas touch on&nbsp;and will guide our discussions throughout the day. The definitions will guide our conversation, and then also become a core outline for governing API operations at every stage of its development--defining the design, deployment, management, and every other area of operations.</p>
<p><strong>Design<br /></strong>A design first strategy is needed to achieve consistency, and maturity before we enter the more costly phases of development and deployment. There are many common approaches to API design on the web, and these are the common areas I'd like to discuss as part of your operations.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Best Practices&nbsp;</strong>- Walk through some of the best practices of API design, and the common approaches.</li>
<li><strong>Requests /&nbsp;</strong><strong>Response</strong>&nbsp;- Talk through the common patterns of how API requests are made, and what responses look like.</li>
<li><strong>Errors&nbsp;</strong>- Think briefly about error handling, and how this feeds into overall stability strategy.</li>
<li><strong>Media Types&nbsp;</strong>- Talk about the common media types in play, starting with HTML, and moving into common API patterns.</li>
<li><strong>Hypermedia</strong>&nbsp;- Move into a more detailed discussion around hypermedia, and how it impacts design.</li>
<li><strong>Schema&nbsp;</strong>- Take the building blocks in the definition discussion, and talk about how they'll be applied as part of design.</li>
<li><strong>Standards&nbsp;</strong>- Walk through some of the common standards that will be applied, such as dates, currencies, and other standards.</li>
<li><strong>Resources&nbsp;</strong>- Talk more about the types of resources that will be in play, and what actions can be taken using these resources.</li>
<li><strong>Process&nbsp;</strong>- What does the full process of API design look like, across all APIs being deployed and managed.</li>
<li><strong>Organization&nbsp;</strong>- How are tooling, practices, knowledge, and process stored, shared, and implemented as part of operations.</li>
<li><strong>Internationalization</strong>&nbsp;- What international considerations are there regarding the overall design of the API its design.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your API design strategy will evolve and mature with time, but setting a healthy base for operations will help set a tone for API operations. How you design your API resources, will affect how they speak to your partners&nbsp;as well as 3rd party developers, and contribute to the overall success or failure of internal and external API consumption.</p>
<p><strong>Versioning<br /></strong>I want to discuss the high level of how things will evolve across API operations. Your web and IT development already have established cycles&nbsp;and workflows. How will these apply to API operations, and what are the key considerations when it comes to API versioning, and all applications that consume them.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Versioning&nbsp;</strong>- How will APIs&nbsp;and their supporting operations be versioned, from design to deprecation?</li>
<li><strong>Communication&nbsp;</strong>- What are the communication considerations around API versioning and changes?</li>
<li><strong>Hypermedia -</strong>&nbsp;Consider hypermedia design practices, and their contribution to the versioning of APIs, and the applications that are integrated.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is necessary to discuss versioning in a technical and business sense. Better understanding how things will change and evolve, and being truthful and honest about how this change impacts operations, integrations, and each application that touches API operations.</p>
<p><strong>DNS<br /></strong>You already have DNS in place for your web operations. We will be taking a look at what is in place, as well as discuss the front line for API operations. DNS provides the base URL for API access, as well as human access for the overall API operations.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Domain(s)&nbsp;</strong>- What domains are required for the API, portal, and other supporting elements of operations.</li>
<li><strong>Management</strong>&nbsp;- What is involved with setup and management of the DNS for API operations.</li>
<li><strong>Stability</strong>&nbsp;- How is DNS stability considered, and managed,&nbsp;ensuring resources remain available.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is already DNS infrastructure in place, this is a discussion around what is required to deliver and support API operations. As with the web, DNS is the frontline for the&nbsp;presence of the API operations, and we need a snapshot of the role it will play in API operations.</p>
<p><strong>Data<br /></strong>I would like to learn more about all of the data sources for your operations. Where is data stored? Where does it come from? What is the complete picture when it comes to data and content accessibility?&nbsp;We can cover a handful of areas to help paint a picture of what is currently&nbsp;behind&nbsp;operations.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Platforms&nbsp;</strong>- What internal,&nbsp;partner and 3rd party platforms, software, and data solutions are in place, or being considered for the next phase.</li>
<li><strong>Files -&nbsp;</strong>What is a general look at how data and content&nbsp;are&nbsp;accessed in a raw file format, considering spreadsheets, XML, CSV, and many other common formats.</li>
<li><strong>Process -</strong>&nbsp;What is a general look at your overall data acquisition, normalization, development, and production&nbsp;life cycle&nbsp;-- how is data currently flowing inside and outside the firewall.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not all APIs will be about delivering data, but a significant portion of APIs will be data or content driven from a myriad of sources. I need an honest perspective of the data landscape behind. Opening up APIs shouldn't just expose everything behind, it should be thoughtfully composed, providing the best possible view of the database backend.</p>
<p><strong>Deployment<br /></strong>Next up is the actual deployment of APIs. Discussing how APIs are deployed, building from the database backend that is available, and moving forward to look at many of the common ways APIs are being deployed today. These are some of the common areas we'll discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Database&nbsp;</strong>- Taking the database snapshot, and building on the current data connectivity in place, and drive a sensible web API facade.</li>
<li><strong>Code&nbsp;</strong>- Considering the code required to drive APIs, providing the business logic behind each resource, allowing interaction with data, content, and algorithms.</li>
<li><strong>Gateway</strong>&nbsp;- What are the current gateways are in place, proxying, and providing access to existing systems, starting with databases, but also other systems.</li>
<li><strong>Cloud&nbsp;</strong>- Moving the discussion into the cloud, and talking about what cloud infrastructure is in place, or being considered as part of future API operations.</li>
<li><strong>On-Premise</strong>&nbsp;- How much of the operations are in the cloud vs. on premise? What are the short and long-term strategies for managing API resources?</li>
<li><strong>Serverless&nbsp;</strong>- How decoupled and modular are existing&nbsp;compute resource across the company? Are looking at or discussing a serverless approach to delivering APIs?</li>
</ul>
<p>These areas represent the current API deployment stack, providing the framework for our discussion when it comes to publishing APIs. How you are currently deploying web infrastructure will significantly impact this discussion. However, I'd like to also introduce you to other approaches to deploying APIs, so that you can consider the future of your web and API infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>Environment / Virtualization<br /></strong>APIs are rarely deployed directly into a production environment. Leading approaches to API deployment involve a variety of virtualization techniques for underlying infrastructure, the APIs themselves, and possibly even the data, and content they serve up. These environments will provide solutions to mock, simulate, conduct quality assurance, production, and other approaches to staging API deployment.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API&nbsp;</strong>- Discuss the need for mocking API resources, allowing resources to be designed and tested before costly development begins.</li>
<li><strong>Data&nbsp;</strong>- What needs are there around testing, simulating, and virtualizing data and content across API consumption to support development and production environments.</li>
<li><strong>Containers&nbsp;</strong>- Are there any containerization and virtualization efforts underway, starting with cloud practices, but also focusing on Docker and other leading approaches to isolating deployment.</li>
<li><strong>Environment&nbsp;</strong>- What are the needs for staging, sandbox, as well as production environments? Let's think about a variety of environments beyond just a single production environment.</li>
<li><strong>Import / Export&nbsp;</strong>- What import and export capabilities will be in place to help support the ephemeral nature of virtualized environments, templates, and other enablers of virtualization.</li>
</ul>
<p>This are might seem like a nice to have a category,&nbsp;but in reality, API and data virtualization can significantly lower the cost of deployment and management&nbsp;and rapidly increasing the rate of maturation of API resources. Different APIs will have varying virtualization needs, let's consider what is needed, based upon your goals with API enablement.</p>
<p><strong>Authentication<br /></strong>Let's take a quick look at what is needed regarding platform authentication. Looking at internal and partner needs first, but then also considering the 3rd party, and authentication using popular social platforms like Facebook, Instagram, or even Github for developers and more technical user.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overview</strong>&nbsp;- What does authentication look like for internal systems and existing applications? Provide some discussion on common concerns, needs, and benefits of the authentication layer of API resources.</li>
<li><strong>Approaches</strong>&nbsp;- Let's walk through some of the common approaches, to making 100% publicly available, all the way to very granular level authorization and access with OAuth--allowing for fine-grained authorization and access at the user and API resource levels.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a common toolbox for enterprise applications. There is also a common set of authentication practices for web APIs. The goal of our conversation will be to set a baseline for this overlap between what you currently have, and what will be needed to deliver API resources across web, mobile, and device applications, in as frictionless a way as possible.</p>
<p><strong>A Portal&nbsp;</strong><br />Where will internal, partner, and public users find API resources? It is common to have a central portal to find all APIs and supporting resources can be found. Providing a focused presence and voice for an API, encouraging the awareness and usage of common APIs across company operations.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Public / Private&nbsp;</strong>- Who will be served by a portal? Will there be separate portals for internal, or partner operations? What is the relationship between portals?&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Target Audience</strong>&nbsp;- Let's talk about the target audience for portals. Who will be stumbling across them, and who will be regular visitors, making it a community thing.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple Portals</strong>&nbsp;- What are the pros and cons of a single, focused portal vs. a variety of portal serving different audiences, and providing a variety level of security.</li>
</ul>
<p>Portals can be permanent, or ephemeral. They can exist in the cloud, on-premise, or on devices. Portals can act like a retail storefront, providing a permanent or tempory snapshot of resources available across the entire platform, in support of a single project or event. Regardless of the objectives, a portal provides a single doorway into API operations.</p>
<p><strong>Management<br /></strong>Next, let's walk through the management of API operations. Focusing on what it takes to manage the intersection of providing and consuming APIs. How will engagement be documented, managed, measured, and provide a wholesale representation of the companies existing platform, brand, and presence?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Onboarding&nbsp;</strong>- What does onboarding look like for the platform. Once onboard, what happens next? How are users engaged, challenged, and verified?</li>
<li><strong>Developer Account(s)&nbsp;</strong>- What resources are available to developers and consumers to help them manage their account, applications, access, and consumption of resources?</li>
<li><strong>Internationalization&nbsp;</strong>- APIs augment your web presence. What are the international efforts already in place, and what are the considerations for API efforts?</li>
<li><strong>Corporate&nbsp;</strong>- What is the corporate presence within the API operations, and how do management reach across the corporate environment, locations, and brand.</li>
<li><strong>API -&nbsp;</strong>What APIs should be present to help access and manage API operations. Every aspect of API operations should be controlled via APIs, adding another dimension to operations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Management doesn't stop here. Each of the following areas will play a role in the management of the platform and have a place in the portal. The goal of API management is to provide a scalable, measurable, observable layer for efficiently managing the technical and&nbsp;business intersection that APIs open up.</p>
<p><strong>Getting Started<br /></strong>First impressions are everything. Let's take the onboarding discussion, and think about it from a consumer's perspective, and establish exactly the right experience for new, as well as existing users. A little bit of discussion ahead of time around what it takes to get started can go a long way.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overview&nbsp;</strong>- Let's think through the big picture of getting started for internal and partner users, then discuss any other potential consumers from the media to application developers.</li>
<li><strong>Steps&nbsp;</strong>- What are the steps involved with getting started with integration? What approval steps required? Where can we reduce friction, and encourage new and existing users to do more?</li>
<li><strong>Targets&nbsp;</strong>- Who are we targeting with this process? Are there different steps, and objectives for different users. Are there users who won't actually be building applications, but just encouraging and supporting other consumers?</li>
<li><strong>FAQ&nbsp;</strong>- Let's address some of the questions developers will have with getting started. Let's discuss a way to plug the FAQ into the overall feedback loop, keeping it a growing and evolving list that represents the evolution of API operations.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is common to launch an API and think only technical people will be accessing it. In reality, an API should speak to technical, as well as non-technical users. You never know who will be researching your API for a story, creating the curriculum for a university class, or other use that hadn't occurred to you. APIs aren't just for developers--anyone should be able to get started without too much friction.</p>
<p><strong>Documentation<br /></strong>The next step in getting started is always about visiting documentation for an API. API documentation provides the next step after the marketing and advertising that directed a consumer to an API. Let's explore what should be available to ensure all users quickly get up to speed on the details of what an API does or doesn't do.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Elements</strong>&nbsp;- What documentation is required for each available API? Let's talk about common approaches to delivering interactive documentation using API definitions and schema, ensuring there is always up to date documentation available for the entire platform.</li>
<li><strong>Solutions&nbsp;</strong>- Documentation should just be about the API resources available, they should also be about the solutions they provide. Sharing case studies, showcasing applications, and helping consumers understand the opportunities available through integration partnerships.</li>
<li><strong>Errors&nbsp;</strong>- Don't just document what a platform does. Let's talk about what an API platform does when it fails. What are the boundaries, and limitations of a platform, helping consumers develop more resilient applications?</li>
</ul>
<p>Documentation is always identified as the number one pain point for developers when it comes to putting APIs to work in web, mobile, and device applications. I will walk you through the advancements made in the area of documentation, minimizing it as a pain point for both API providers and consumers.</p>
<p><strong>Software Development Kits (SDK)<br /></strong>It is common for API providers to provide a variety of language and platform development kits for consumers to put to use. Web APIs are language and platform agnostic and can be consumed in any programming language. There are some common aspects of delivering and management code as part of API operations--let's look at some of the common areas:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overview&nbsp;</strong>- What is the overall tone of code for a platform. Is there a heavy lead for development internally, is it partner driven, or will it be more of a community effort? There are plenty of approaches to managing and delivering code in support of API integration.</li>
<li><strong>Language Samples&nbsp;</strong>- Starting with the samples, many providers offer up simple, standalone code samples in a variety of programming languages, giving only what is needed for making and handling of a single request.</li>
<li><strong>Language SDKs&nbsp;</strong>- Additionally more mature providers also offer up complete software development kits that help developers with authentication, as well as working on all available API paths.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile SDKs</strong>&nbsp;- Beyond language SDKs, some API providers focus on mobile SDKs helping consumers deliver iPhone, Android, and Windows applications using API resources.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Code Management&nbsp;</strong>- A discussion about where the code is managed. The common approach is to use Github, which provides the resources for managing code but done in a social way that also allows continued engagement with consumers.</li>
<li><strong>Platform Development Kits (PDK)&nbsp;</strong>- What platform integrations needs will there be? Is there the need or desire to provide WordPress, SalesForce, AWS, Heroku, Facebook, or other existing platform integration.</li>
<li><strong>Single Page Applications (SPA)</strong>&nbsp;- Will there be single page application libraries and scaffolding available for API consumers to use as a start for delivering storefronts, and other deliverables?</li>
<li><strong>Browser Development Kits (BDK)</strong>&nbsp;- What browser add-on toolkits will be needed to help developers better integrate with the browser, providing a different experience for end-users.</li>
<li><strong>Discovery&nbsp;</strong>- How are SDKs discovered, made available, and showcased as part of API operations, making sure standardized, approved resources are put to use as often as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is where APIs really shine, providing a variety of openly licensed or even premium resources for API consumers and developers to put to use. When you look at the leading pioneers in the space like Amazon, SalesFroce, and Google, they all have a wealth of existing code resources, helping to go from idea to integration as quickly as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Support<br /></strong>Let's talk about supporting API operations. Providing the necessary technical and business support that individuals, companies&nbsp;and any consumer will need when working with APIs in their integration or application--a successful API has a wealth of support resources that scale with the demand.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overview</strong>&nbsp;- What support resources are available? There should be a variety of channels, as well as dedicated human resources to providing timely, and information support when developers need it.</li>
<li><strong>Self-Service Support&nbsp;</strong>- It is common for APIs to provide a variety of self-service support like forums, and knowledge bases, allowing consumers to find answers to their questions 24 hours a day, seven days a week, without directly contacting platform support.</li>
<li><strong>Direct Support&nbsp;</strong>- In addition to a variety of self-service support elements, there should be a handful of direct support channels like email, phone, chat, or a ticketing system.</li>
</ul>
<p>As with other areas of IT and web operations, API support will overlap with existing services. However, because of the technical nature of API integration, support should include a heightened level of technical expertise, understanding the challenges of API consumers.</p>
<p><strong>Communication<br /></strong>Complimenting support, let's talk about the communication strategy for API operations. This should overlap with existing communication efforts, but if the resources are available, it can be beneficial to have a dedicated API operations strategy and presence.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Channels&nbsp;</strong>- Which channels are used? Blog, Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Github, Youtube, and other leading platforms should all be considered for an APIs presence.</li>
<li><strong>Strategy</strong>&nbsp;- I walk you through the common elements of a communication strategy, highlighting what an API can do, what people are doing with the resources, as well as other platform activity, providing a common heartbeat for API operations.</li>
<li><strong>Process&nbsp;</strong>- Let's talk about the execution of the communication strategy. What resources are available, how can it be grown over time, and possibly involve community efforts, encouraging passionate consumers to help communicate the platform message?</li>
</ul>
<p>This can dovetail with existing communication but needs to possess a focused message that speaks to a more technical audience. It helps to provide separate channels dedicated to a developer message, but take advantage of cross-pollination between mainstream and API operational efforts, keeping a message in alignment, and increasing the reach.</p>
<p><strong>Road Map / Issues / Change Log&nbsp;<br /></strong>One of the benefits of doing APIs is that they can help deal with change and shifts in the development process easier. There are many common ways in which an API helps address change, and evolution, something that is integrated with support, and communication efforts.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Public</strong>&nbsp;- What is involved internally with road map planning, dealing with issues that arise, and the historical tracking of changes--including communication.</li>
<li><strong>Private</strong>&nbsp;- What is involved externally with&nbsp;road map&nbsp;planning, dealing with issues that arise, and the historical tracking of change--including communication.</li>
<li><strong>Process&nbsp;</strong>- What process is involved with change management, and the approval of the roadmap, and establishing of the schedule and timeline<strong>.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Communications&nbsp;</strong>- How and when are changes communicated? How transparent is the platform when it comes to issues? How is change communicated?</li>
</ul>
<p>Change management is essential to address change for not just the platform, but the many distributed applications and integrations that depend on APIs. Clarity, transparency, and communication in this area will potentially make or break a platform, determining the success of the platform, as well as partners.</p>
<p><strong>Monitoring / Testing / Performance<br /></strong>Let's spend some time talking about the monitoring of API operations, their availability, performance, and assessment of whether or not they are meeting their intended objectives. Some of this will already be in place with web efforts but will need a unique set of considerations when it comes to API operations.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Management&nbsp;</strong>- How are monitoring and testing set up? What is measured, and how is it reported and communicated across operations.</li>
<li><strong>Targeted&nbsp;</strong>- What does targeted testing and monitoring look like providing regional and international coverage for all testing and monitoring.</li>
<li><strong>Status&nbsp;</strong>- How is the status of operations presented, giving a single external dashboard for consumers to see the current and historical status of operations.</li>
<li><strong>Notification&nbsp;</strong>- Who is notified when there are monitoring, testing, and performance concerns, providing a hierarchy or notifications about changes.</li>
<li><strong>Reporting</strong>&nbsp;- How are results included in internal, and partner reporting, and part of service level agreements and partner contracts for API access.</li>
<li><strong>3rd Party&nbsp;</strong>- Is there monitoring of third party providers in place, allowing for an understanding of how reliable the 3rd party services being consumed are.</li>
</ul>
<p>This are of API operations will help us understand how well we are doing executing the strategy, and meeting internal and partner expectations. Monitoring and testing should be executed as part of every API deployed, led by development groups, but should include business unit, and partner stakeholders in the conversation, notification, and discussions about changes to monitoring and testing efforts.</p>
<p><strong>Reliability<br /></strong>Let's talk about the reliability of the platform, and what will be expected of internal and partner stakeholders. We'll take what we learned in the monitoring and testing discussions, and translate it into business terms, and understand what was promised as part of API operations and integration.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Assertions&nbsp;</strong>- What assertions are made regarding each API resource, as well as groups of API resources. What are the technical details, as well as the plain English explaining the business objective, and the legalese&nbsp;that will pass lawyer review of assertions made?</li>
<li><strong>Service Level Agreement&nbsp;</strong>- What actual service contracts are available and in place regarding API operations. These are the legal contracts that are governing the expectations of API availability and consumption.</li>
</ul>
<p>If API resources are to be monetized upstream or downstream they will have to meet the expected level of reliability. Meeting the API contracts in place for accessing and consuming data, content, and algorithmic resources, and justify the money being exchanged for services.</p>
<p><strong>Security<br /></strong>Along with reliability, security will be essential to a successful API operation. APIs leverage the web, but are far from open and available to anyone with the web address. There are many technical areas to consider when it comes to API security, but let's just talk the basics this round.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overview</strong>&nbsp;- A well defined, discoverable, and consistent API approach brings a level of security by itself. Let's discuss the other aspects of security when it comes to API operations from authentication outlined above to DNS level attacks that might disrupt operations.</li>
<li><strong>Transport-Level Security&nbsp;</strong>- Encryption by default is the norm for API operations, and we'll discuss encryption in transport, as well as other platform or client, led efforts supporting encryption.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can expand on this area if needed, but I prefer to address a well-defined API strategy as the first step in platform security. APIs help standardizes how resources are accessed and put to use, which goes a long way to help secure valuable corporate interests and protect valuable corporate assets.</p>
<p><strong>Legal Department<br /></strong>Let's make sure and cover the legal side of operations lightly. As with security, we will lightly cover the legal department&nbsp;and stay out of the weeds. There are a handful of areas I'd like to discuss, just to make sure we have this side of operations in order.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Privacy&nbsp;</strong>- What privacy considerations are there regarding data and content being made available, as well as the developers using the APIs, and the users of the applications that are built on the application.</li>
<li><strong>Terms of Service</strong>&nbsp;- We can talk through some of the ways a platform's terms of service will need to be augmented as part of API operations--discussing any concerns you may have regarding the API terms of service.</li>
<li><strong>Licensing&nbsp;</strong>- I'll walk through the layers of the licensing stack for API operations, starting with server side code, ad extending to the content and data access via API operations, and the client code being put to use across all integrations.</li>
</ul>
<p>The terms of service, privacy policy, and licensing will affect the business side of API operations. This area governs all other aspects of partner, and 3rd party integrations. These areas need to be well defined, providing clear guidance for developers who are integrating with the APIs being made available.</p>
<p><strong>Branding<br /></strong>As an extension of the legal department, let's also discuss branding for API operations. This is one of the most important of API operations but is often overlooked and under invested in when it comes to execution. Let's talk about a few of the common areas I'm seeing API providers deal with branding.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overview&nbsp;</strong>- Let's talk about goals, and existing branding efforts in place, then we put some thought into what should be in place to not just govern branding but encourage developers to help strengthen the brand and extend the reach.</li>
<li><strong>Assets&nbsp;</strong>- What image assets are in place to help developers understand branding, and easily extend the brand in their applications. Do not make developers work in this area, there need to be a wealth of resources that help them do this right.</li>
<li><strong>Requirements&nbsp;</strong>- Provide a structured set of branding requirements for developers. Let's discuss what some of the common approaches are depending on the implementation.</li>
<li><strong>Guides</strong>&nbsp;- Does it make sense to package up the branding requirements, and assets into a single guide, that developers can share with their team, and bake into their development process.</li>
</ul>
<p>When it comes to generating value, branding is one of the most important tools in the API toolbox. Extending the network of your retail and online presence, through consistent implementation, execution of the brand is part of the API game. When done right, you can make a significant impact, and extend the reach and strength of a platform using APIs.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery<br /></strong>Any moderately sized company will operate potentially hundreds, if not thousands of APIs, while also depending on tens&nbsp;or even hundreds of external APIs. The discovery of available resources, no matter where they are in the development life cycle is an important area to discuss and plan for.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Inventory&nbsp;</strong>- Taking what we discussed in the data and deployment areas of discussion, let's think about these raw sources as part of the wider API discovery discussion.</li>
<li><strong>Service Inventory&nbsp;</strong>- While this is a discussion about the future of APIs, I am guessing there are already a number of existing APIs in place from existing software and infrastructure in place, as well as the consumption of 3rd party Saas and cloud services.</li>
<li><strong>Schema&nbsp;</strong>- How can APIs be discovered&nbsp;using schema, and how can the schema of all data be well defined and reused using common formats like JSON schema.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Definitions&nbsp;</strong>- Along with schema how can API specifications like OpenAPI and APIs.json be applied to help define APIs, and make them more discoverable as part of API operations.</li>
<li><strong>Search /&nbsp;</strong><strong>Catalog&nbsp;</strong>- Discovery will involve the presence of a catalog and other solutions for search APIs and schema applied.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Public API Search Engines / Directories</strong>&nbsp;- Is there a need for being listed in public API search engines and directories, helping bring awareness to the existence of API resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>Much of API discovery will depend on the approach we take to define and design APIs deployed as part of API operations. API discovery is critical to this working, allowing internal, partner, and public consumers to find what they need, and properly integrate into their applications.</p>
<p><strong>Embeddable<br /></strong>Defining where the code meets branding, I'd like to spend some time talking about embeddable tooling available as part of API operations. These are usually JavaScript goodies that leverage the API to help extend the reach of the platform.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overview</strong>&nbsp;- What types of embeddable are there? Let's discuss the simple examples like Twitter and Facebook share buttons, to the more sophisticated commerce, payment, or other API-enabled feature.</li>
<li><strong>Tools&nbsp;</strong>- Let's talk about what tooling is available for defining, customizing, and extending embeddable tooling, helping API consumers build the embeddable toling they need.</li>
<li><strong>Formats&nbsp;</strong>- Building on the API definition portion of this discussion, I want to make sure and discuss some of the open formats for developing embeddable tooling from oEmbed, to common data standards that help streamline the embedding of API tooling.</li>
</ul>
<p>The embeddable portion of operations will help put the branding for the platform into action. Giving developers tools, and other assets that they can put to work in their web and mobile applications, as well as signage, and retail experiences. The goal is to extend the reach of the platform to partner web, mobile, and device properties, with just a simple copy and paste when possible.</p>
<p><strong>Webhooks<br /></strong>It is common to think of APIs as just a one-way street -- allowing consumers to make requests and get responses. A common approach to making APIs a two-way street has emerged called web hooks. Allowing API consumers to define and subscribe to events, making API calls to locations they define, as part of regular API operations.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Core</strong>&nbsp;- Let's talk about what webhooks are, and how they are being put to use my leading API platform. While this isn't a standard, there are common practices in play that can help streamline setup and usage.</li>
<li><strong>Inbound&nbsp;</strong>- Let's talk about allowing for inbound webhooks, defining custom services that can receive requests, based upon specific events, and further define API operations.</li>
<li><strong>Outbound&nbsp;</strong>-- Additionally we will discuss the most common approaches to outbound webhooks that make calls and may push data to external URLs, based upon the occurrence of activities and events across the platform.</li>
</ul>
<p>Webhooks help in&nbsp;alleviating the strain on API resources, reducing the number of calls an application will be making. Allowing applications to define and subscribe to events, and receive webhook notifications occur, such as new product shows up in catalog&nbsp;or a purchase is made.</p>
<p><strong>Orchestration<br /></strong>Let's spend some time discussing the platform orchestration opportunities. Outlining some of the other ways APIs are enabling the synchronization, interoperability, and integration between platforms, and applications used across the enterprise and by partners. &nbsp;These are the areas I'd like to help you be more aware of when it comes to API enabled orchestration of the platform.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>iPaaS&nbsp;</strong>- Availability of next generation ETL solutions like If This Then That and Zapier, allow any user to use APIs to orchestrate business processes, defining what APIs means to their regular work.</li>
<li><strong>Continuous Integration&nbsp;</strong>- The evolution of development, making the whole develop stack API driven so that developers can not just access data and content, but they can use APIs to customize their access to resources.</li>
<li><strong>Spreadsheets&nbsp;</strong>- APIs are being used to publish data to spreadsheets, making it available in business functions and reporting, while also making valuable spreadsheet data available for use as part of API deployment and operations.</li>
</ul>
<p>These areas represent how developers and average business users are putting APIs to use as part of regular IT and business operations. By providing API resources to internal and external users, individual users can be empowered to get things done on their own, within the structure of predefined governance and data and content access strategies. Many of these areas are available by default, just by having APIs available--the connectors for moving things around the web with iPaaS, weaving into continuous integration workflows, and spreadsheets are already available out there.</p>
<p><strong>Logging<br /></strong>A structured approach to logging of all API activity is essential to management, security, and the health of operations. It can also become another layer to API operations, as well as monetization, providing access to valuable aggregate, trending, and other valuable data derived from the exhaust of API operations.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overview&nbsp;</strong>- Let's talk about the logging features present with existing infrastructure, and the API management layer of this conversation. Let's talk about the other opportunities involved when logging is API driven, providing programmatic access to every aspect of operations.</li>
<li><strong>Process</strong>&nbsp;- In addition to the recording, and storage of log data let's talk about the analysis and reporting objectives around this data, as well as the privacy and security implications of logging at all layers.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the layer where we measure everything happening across API operations. It is the awareness of how resources are being accessed and used, provide the data needed to identify where value exists and generate revenue from all aspects operations. While logging should exist at all layers, from the&nbsp;server to client, it should be done sensibly, securely, and with as light of a footprint as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Analytics / Visualization<br /></strong>Providing the meaningful layer on top of platform logging, I want to spend time talking about the analysis, reporting, and visualization requirements around API operations. What is needed to deliver required intelligence to dashboards, dynamic, and static reporting?&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Analytics&nbsp;</strong>- What analysis will be required of data, providing additional algorithmic layers of access beyond just the raw data behind API operations.</li>
<li><strong>Visualizations</strong>&nbsp;- Providing visually derived meaning from all data gathered, and the analysis provided on top of API operations.</li>
<li><strong>API</strong>&nbsp;- Let's makes sure that the analytics layer is all API driven, and the visualization layer is included as part of the embeddable API aspects of operations.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>With this layer is developed as part of the overall embeddable API strategy for the platform, all the analysis, and visualizations will be embeddable in emails, other web or mobile applications, delivering insight, awareness, and intelligence wherever it is needed.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Monetization<br /></strong>Now we are really getting into the business side of this discussion&nbsp;and begin talking about the nuts and bolts of generating revenue from API operations. Before we assemble an actual plan for generating revenue from operations, we need to discuss other aspects of investment in the platform, and how value is generated, or not generated.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Acquisition&nbsp;</strong>- What is required to acquire data and content, tracking the costs associated with licensing, royalties, or other aspects of discovering and acquiring data or content.</li>
<li><strong>Development&nbsp;</strong>- A breakdown of the costs involved with developing APIs, making data, content, or algorithms available as APIs, and accessible via the platform.</li>
<li><strong>Operation</strong>&nbsp;- Taking a look at what it will cost to operate an API, considering not just the technical, but also the business and legal side of operations.</li>
<li><strong>Direct Value&nbsp;</strong>- Discussing the direct value of data, content, media, and other resources being made available via APIs, exploring the tangible and known value present.</li>
<li><strong>Indirect Value&nbsp;</strong>- Thinking a little about the indirect value generated by APIs, like traffic to&nbsp;website&nbsp;or maybe brand awareness, bringing value to the table, but not direct revenue generation.</li>
<li><strong>Reporting&nbsp;</strong>- What are some of the reporting requirements present around investment into API operations. Understanding and sharing awareness around what it takes to create, and operate an API platform.</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll think about monetization from the big picture, but also down to the individual API level--understand what it takes to operate any single API, as well as how they support overall objectives. Without an awareness of what it takes to develop and operate each available API, we will never fully be able to determine the return on investment from any plan we establish.</p>
<p><strong>Plans<br /></strong>With a general awareness of what it will take to develop and operate APIs, we can start planning a little more about how access tiers will be defined, what will be charged for API access, and even what might be paid for incentivizing access to some API resources. I would like to discuss many of the common aspects of how API plans are being operated by the most successful providers like Amazon, Google, and others.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overview -&nbsp;</strong>Let's spend some time discussing how API plans operate. Thinking about the variety of ways APIs can be mixed, matched, and a variety of access levels can be defined to maximize access and usage, while also generating revenue in a sensible way.</li>
<li><strong>Elements</strong>&nbsp;- What are the elements of API access? What other elements are present like support, and specific features are present--further defining what is included beyond just API access.</li>
<li><strong>Timeframes</strong>&nbsp;- What timeframes impact API access plans. What considerations are there per month, day, or possibly by the second? Let's think through the timeframes that drive API plans.</li>
<li><strong>Metrics&nbsp;</strong>- What is being measured as part of each plan level? By the API call, amount of storage, or measuring bandwidth. There are many different metrics to be defined, depending on the resource available, and the monetization objective in play.</li>
<li><strong>Geo&nbsp;</strong>- With cloud computing advances there are many possibilities for additional monetization layers to API plans that include geographically deployed APIs, and in-country services depending on laws and regulatory climate.</li>
<li><strong>Limits</strong>&nbsp;- Let's look to define the limits of each plan, talking about what types of constraints can be put in place to incentivize desired behavior, and drive revenue in an appropriate direction.</li>
<li><strong>Resources</strong>&nbsp;- Let's spend some time thinking about individual API access, and the monetization opportunities involved with different levels of access--this is widely known as service composition, providing different layers of access based upon business objectives.</li>
<li><strong>Extensions -</strong>&nbsp;What opportunities are there for an extension? Can plans be extended and overreached either by usage or possibly paying for preferred treatment--let's think about what the boundaries are.</li>
</ul>
<p>API plans aren't just for public access to APIs, they can be crafted specifically for enterprise level and partner access needs. They can also be established internal consumption, defining the access levels and usage across teams, or geographic locations. API plans aren't just for defining, and charging for API access, they should also be used to measure value created, and possibly defining cash payouts to partners, affiliates, and resellers, encouraging the desired behavior across all API consumers.</p>
<p><strong>Partners<br /></strong>Beyond the basic plans, I wanted to discuss the higher levels of access, providing tiers of access that are usually not metered, or limited, providing special considerations for trusted partners. There are a number of common approaches to helping enable partner integrations, driving the overall objectives of the platform.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Program Details&nbsp;</strong>- What existing partner efforts exist? What are the details of existing data or content acquisition or consumption? Beyond the basic levels of access, what should we be thinking about?</li>
<li><strong>Access Levels&nbsp;</strong>- What are the partner level considerations to discuss? Are partners given early or exclusive access to resources? There are many ways to leverage the reading or writing of data and include them as part of partner program incentives.</li>
<li><strong>Legal&nbsp;</strong>- What are the individual legal concerns with partner levels of access. Existing contracts in place, and the existing API-related data or content partnerships that might drive API access tier considerations.</li>
<li><strong>Marketing Activities&nbsp;</strong>- Are there a specific marketing or advertising considerations that might impact partner access, providing special promotions and other activities to drive integration and partnerships.</li>
<li><strong>Support&nbsp;</strong>- What levels of support are given to partner API access levels, and support the overall program. Support is commonly given to the entire community, with an emphasis on preferred or unpaid support for partners.</li>
<li><strong>Content&nbsp;</strong>- What content opportunities are there for partners to participate in. Weaving their messaging into existing marketing and advertising activities, and demonstrate the API integration or application fueling the partnership.</li>
<li><strong>Communication&nbsp;</strong>- What are the additional layers of API operations communication strategy that are focused on partner activity? Some portions of the execution might be dedicated to partners, while others have a general focus.</li>
<li><strong>Financial&nbsp;</strong>- What are the financial reporting, and tracking needs for partner levels of access, measuring their usage of resources, revenue sharing, or collection?</li>
<li><strong>API</strong>&nbsp;- Will there be an API for the partner program? Allowing for programmatic access to program details, activities, support, content, communication, and other elements.</li>
</ul>
<p>The three main areas of API access companies are thinking about are internal, partner, and the&nbsp;general public. Partner tends to drive a significant portion of the efforts especially early on until providers gain the expertise and platform maturity necessary to successfully operate a fully public API platform. A well-defined partner access can provide the momentum needed to extend the platform's resources to a wider audience in a way that furthers a company mission.</p>
<p><strong>Evangelism / Outreach / Inreach<br /></strong>Last I want to discuss the evangelism, outreach, and what I like to call reach around API operations. Successful API operations have advocates, evangelists, and dedicated resources to helping spread the word about APIs, supporting the needs of consumers, and ensure there is a feedback loop around everything happening. There are some common approaches established by leading providers when it comes to API outreach.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/t-shirts/KL_InApiWeTrust-1000.png" alt="" width="30%" align="right" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Goals</strong>&nbsp;- Let's start again with the basics. What are our goals in doing APIs, and wanting to take an API-first approach to internal, and partner operations?</li>
<li><strong>Consumer Outreach</strong>&nbsp;- What&nbsp;can be done to reach out to the developer community, and join the existing API community, to drive integration with the platform?</li>
<li><strong>Partner Outreach&nbsp;</strong>- What separate outreach is required for partners, maintaining relationships, and establishing a feedback loop for the future of platform operations?</li>
<li><strong>Landscape Analysis</strong>&nbsp;- What research has been done regarding existing, competitive, or possibly complementary API programs, maybe as part of existing efforts?</li>
<li><strong>Communications</strong>&nbsp;- Let's take the communication strategy and think of it in terms of reaching new users, and spreading awareness of the platform.</li>
<li><strong>Support&nbsp;</strong>- Let's also talk about how support should be woven into outreach strategies, using publicly available platforms that bring SEO exposure for the platform.</li>
<li><strong>GitHub&nbsp;</strong>- When it comes to managing code, and API operations many providers lean on Github for code management, as well as social engagement with the developer community.</li>
<li><strong>Social Management&nbsp;</strong>- Successful API efforts engage with consumers via the social channels they are already operating on, including Github, Facebook, Twitter, and Linkedin.</li>
<li><strong>Events</strong>&nbsp;- What does the event landscape look like for the platform? What conferences, meetups, or hackathons can be attended, or hosted. Is there a calendar available to the community to deepen the engagement with the community.</li>
<li><strong>Dashboard</strong>&nbsp;- Is there a private, or even public dashboard for outreach to begin, providing links to all outreach across operations, all reporting, and community activity?</li>
<li><strong>Reporting&nbsp;</strong>- What regular reporting occurs around outreach, keeping stakeholders informed, and aware--let's discuss how important reporting is to keeping stakeholders invested.</li>
</ul>
<p>Outreach is about connecting the feedback loop around API operations. It all starts over again with the feedback gathered at this level. You take this back to the definition layer, enrich your approach, dial in the design of new and existing API efforts, and do it all again. It is touch to articulate and convey the cyclical aspects of API operations, and how companies get better at it with each wave, if they invest in the right areas. API operations are much more than a technical, IT, developer effort--in 2017, it is more about business and people&nbsp;than it ever is about just the data.</p>
<p><strong>Operational Strategy<br /></strong>This is the framework for an API operational strategy. I don't expect you to have all the answers for everything here. It is just meant to help guide our discussion, and provide a framework that we can organize and hang details on for you to take home and consider as part of your team's strategy. Hopefully, this outline provides you with a primer for our&nbsp;discussion. It might seem like a lot, but we should be able to get through in a couple hours, then we can think about the draft of this document for you to take back to your company.</p>

<p>There is a reason why I encourage API providers to look at not just the technology of APIs&nbsp;but also invest heavily into the business and politics of API operations. There is a reason I evangelize a more open, web-based approach to doing APIs, even if you are peddling hardware and device APIs. It is because there are a number of human-centered elements present when doing APIs, that will&nbsp;define your services, and ultimately contribute to whether or not they are a success&nbsp;or a failure.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cepro.com/article/new_sonos_api_disrupts_home_automation_integration_but_lays_solid_foundatio">One example of this from my API news curation archives is from the Sonos API ecosystem, and a pretty big blunder in communication the audio device platform made late last year, that is significantly impacting their partnerships in 2017.</a> &nbsp;Directly from the CEPro article:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>A collective cheer roared from home-technology installers at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cepro.com/cedia">CEDIA Expo 2016</a>, when&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cepro.com/article/sonos_now_integrates_for_real_iport_and_lutron_launch_new_sonos_controls">Sonos announced an API</a>&nbsp;for home-automation integration starting with&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cepro.com/topic/tag/Control4">Control4</a>&nbsp;(Nasdaq:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/ctrl">CTRL</a>),&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cepro.com/topic/tag/Crestron">Crestron</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cepro.com/topic/tag/iPort">iPort</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cepro.com/topic/tag/Lutron">Lutron</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cepro.com/topic/tag/Savant">Savant</a>.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>These partners &ndash; and most other respectable smart-home systems providers &ndash; have integrated with Sonos for many years, albeit with unsanctioned drivers created through reverse-engineering of a fairly straightforward UPnP-based protocol.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>But the new API kind of snuck up on dealers and vendors alike, with their customers waking up to a brand new&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cepro.com/topic/tag/Sonos">Sonos</a>&nbsp;experience in late December, courtesy of an auto-update by Sonos.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The new experience was inferior to the original, with users unable to access Spotify or Amazon Music from the home automation system, except to select favorites created through Sonos&rsquo;s own app.</em></p>
<p>When you are operating an API that many different businesses depend on, communication is essential. this is why I advocate that API providers always have a clear communication and support strategy, as well as the road map, issue management, and change log processes. Every single change has to be considered for its impact on the community, and you have to have a plan for how you will be communicating and supporting&nbsp;your API consumers needs around a change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is also why API providers should be understanding the benefits of hypermedia when it comes to change management. Hypermedia design patterns provide you with a more honest approach to dealing change, one that helps make your partner's clients more fault tolerant. It is well worth the time learning about the handful of leading hypermedia media types. Any one of them would have helped Sonos manage change.</p>
<p>There are multiple tools in the API toolbox to help you manage change. In the en,d the most effective tools involve human to human interaction, and actually talking to your partners early on about change, and making sure you have a robust communication strategy throughout your API lifecycle. Us engineers like to think it is the API technology making the magic happen, but in the end, there is more to this than just having application programming interfaces, it is about also having the right human interfaces.</p>

<p>I am finally seeing more solutions available for API providers when it comes to publishing an portal for their API operations. <a href="http://portal.minimum.apievangelist.com/">I've long had my minimum viable API portal definition</a>, which I recently <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/03/02/my-developer-portal-checklist-for-a-human-services-api/">deployed to support the Miami Open211 API</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/02/28/the-aws-serverless-api-portal/">I also wrote about AWS serverless approach to an API portal</a>. Next up, is <a href="https://tyk.io/2017/03/01/new-wordpress-api-portal-plugin/">a WordPress solution from my API management partner Tyk</a>.</p>
<p>The WordPress API portal solution has the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatic developer registration on Tyk when developers sign up in WP</li>
<li>Configuration of API policies available for token registration</li>
<li>Developers may request an access token for the available API policies</li>
<li>Automatic or manual approval of key requests</li>
<li>Storage of token (references) by name and API policy</li>
<li>Revoking of tokens by developer</li>
<li>Display usage statistics per key</li>
<li>Request quota usage per key</li>
</ul>
<p>All the basics you need when standing up a basic API operation. If WordPress is your go-to content management system, then it might make sense for you to think about API portal&nbsp;in these terms. The<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://opentransportdata.swiss/en/">Swiss Federal Railways (SBB-CFF-FFS)</a>&nbsp;is already using the plugin&nbsp;in production, and you can <a href="https://github.com/liip/wp-tyk-dev-portal">download the plugin on Github</a>, or find it <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/tyk-developer-portal/">over at WordPress.org</a>.</p>
<p>We need multiple versions of API portals like this, designed for every type of platform a company, organization, institution, and government agency might be already using as a default platform for their operations. This is why API management providers <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/02/27/the-api-definition-for-the-tyk-api-gateway/">need to follow Tyk's&nbsp;lead and make sure your solution is API driven</a>--practicing what you preach so that your API management solution can be integrated anywhere.</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/company/logos/grpc.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/03/03/google-shares-their-api-design-guide/">I have been processing Google's API design guide</a>, and an unexpected part of the work has been learning more about gRPC, which Google is&nbsp;<span>"converging designs of socket-based RPC APIs with HTTP-based REST APIs." -- something I have not seen in an API design guide until now. "<span>gRPC uses&nbsp;</span><a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/">protocol buffers</a><span>&nbsp;as the Interface Definition Language (IDL) for describing both the service interface and the structure of the payload messages", and is something I'm hearing more chatter about from larger providers, which I think represents the evolving world of API design beyond the old REST days.</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.grpc.io/docs/">According to the site</a>, "gRPC is used in last mile of computing in mobile and web client since it can generate libraries for iOS and Android and uses standards based HTTP/2 as transport allowing it to easily traverse proxies and firewalls. There is also work underway to develop a JS library for use in browsers. Beyond that, it is ideal as a microservices interconnect, not just because the core protocol is very efficient but also because the framework has pluggable authentication, load balancing etc. Google itself is also transitioning to use it to connect microservices."</p>
<p>To help me learn anything I need an example to reverse engineer, showing me how things work--so here are the examples they provide from the site:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-bigtable-client">Google Cloud BigTable Client APIs</a></li>
<li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/big-data/2016/03/announcing-grpc-alpha-for-google-cloud-pubsub">Google Cloud PubSub APIs</a></li>
<li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/speech/reference/rpc/">Google Cloud Speech APIs</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I'm going to add a research area for gRPC, similar to <a href="http://hypermedia.apievangelist.com">hypermedia</a>, as well as GraphQL. It helps me better keep track of the&nbsp;news&nbsp;about each approach to crafting APIs, and a single place I can go to reference service providers, and working examples. I've had gRPC / Protocol Buffers on my monitoring list for some time now, but seeing Google invest so heavily in this area gives me a signal that I should be paying attention to gRPC more, and gathering more examples that I can share with my readers.</p>
<p>I'm thinking that I will assemble some sort of toolbox area in my API design research, helping folks understand when a more RESTful approach makes sense, as well as when hypermedia, GraphQL, or maybe a gRPC approach might be more appropriate. Next, I'm going to dive into BigTable, PubSub, and Speech APIs to see gRPC in action--something I'm hoping that will help me better understand <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/03/03/google-shares-their-api-design-guide/">Google's approach to API design</a>, which something I'm struggling with grasping completely.</p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2017_03_04_at_10.46.01_pm.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="https://apis.guru/browse-apis/">I am building on the great work by the APIs.guru team</a>, assembling a collection of Google definitions. I will be forking their Google Open definitions and wrap them in <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json indexes</a>, so I can analyze the APIs at the 100K level, and potentially augment, and enrich the existing OpenAPIs that the APIs.guru team has worked so hard on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When APIs.guru crafts an OpenAPI for an API, they have a set of OpenAPI extensions that&nbsp;provides a snapshot of the history for each OpenAPI. They provide six OpenAPI extensions, specific to their API discovery objectives:</p>
<blockquote>x-apiClientRegistration:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;url: 'https://console.developers.google.com'<br /> x-logo:<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;url: 'https://www.gstatic.com/images/icons/material/product/2x/blogger_64dp.png'<br /> x-origin:<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;format: google<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;url: 'https://www.googleapis.com/discovery/v1/apis/blogger/v3/rest'<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;version: v1<br /> x-preferred: true<br /> x-providerName: googleapis.com<br /> x-serviceName: blogger</blockquote>
<p>I like that they include the origin of thier API definitions. I want to do the same, but I would like to turn x-origin into a collection so that I can add multiple entries into it, and evolve it beyond just origin. I want to show the provenance for the API definition, that I build mine on top of APIs.guru's hard work, and that they built theirs on Google's using their discovery format. I'm going to add x-provenance to mine&nbsp;and start tracking on the source of where my API definitions originate and include anything else present when I imported.</p>
<p>It is important that we are able to have many different copies of an API's definition, in a variety of formats. There will be copies of API definitions all over Github, and the web, for a variety of different purposes. I'd like to see more stewards of API definitions include some sort of origin, provenance, and history for their API definitions. If they are yours, they are authoritative and it isn't necessary, but if they are for 3rd party APIs, try to capture as much information as you can about where it comes from, to help everyone understand it's history.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/08/13/a-common-open-source-api-design-editor-is-needed-for-api-service-providers/">This is a repeat story of one I&nbsp;wrote two years ago</a>, but things haven't changed so I'm going to rant about again, 2017 style. We need someone to develop an open source, visual API design editor. There is the <a href="http://swagger.io/swagger-editor/">Swagger Editor</a>, but that is more a web IDE, and I'm looking for a well designed, intuitive, visual editor for managing your OpenAPI definitions, that is embeddable and easily integrated into any web or mobile system.</p>
<p>There are examples of nice visual API design editors with some of the leading API service providers, but I'm looking for something any API service provider could put to work. I included these examples in my last story, except I'm including Stoplight this round instead of Gelato, because they gave me an upgrade my account message,&nbsp;and wouldn't let me see the interface. These are currently my favorite three API design editors:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://studio.restlet.com">Restlet</a>&nbsp;- A design, deployment, management service provider.</li>
<li><a href="https://apimatic.io">APIMATIC</a>&nbsp; - An SDK, API definition transformer, and continous integration provider.</li>
<li><a href="https://stoplight.io">Stoplight</a>&nbsp;- An API design, definition, documentation, and orchestration provider.</li>
</ul>
<p>I enjoy using all three of their API design interfaces. They are well thought out&nbsp;and provide what you need to design new APIs, as well manage the design of your existing APIs. While they are doing a good job at this, it is something I'd like to see standardized, and open sourced, so that other service providers do not have to reinvent the wheel here. We shouldn't have to use a different API design interface for each service we depend on, we need a common editor, making things more familiar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ok, rant over. This is something I'll keep talking about until there is a solution. Oh, I have to say, I am impressed with what <a href="http://getmateria.com">the Materia&nbsp;team</a> has done for API design on the desktop. Between them and Stoplight, there has been positive motion forward. I'm just looking to give things another nudge and help folks understand the opportunity. I'll explore possible business models for such a solution in another post, and keep beating this drum until I get what I want.</p>

<p>Everyone developing APIs struggles with API design. Ok, maybe a few of the gurus out there don't, but the rest of us need education, practice, and ideally someone or something to help guide us through the best practices when it comes to API design. I try to track what different companies are doing when it comes to API design, and <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/tools/design-guides/">maintain a list of any API design guides I come across in my work</a>.</p>
<p>If you are looking to start getting a grasp on API design at your company, organization, institution or agency, I recommend starting on the journey to define your own API design guide--you will be surprised what you can learn along the way. You can kick things off by visiting my <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">API design research</a>, but I strongly recommend you head over <a href="http://apistylebook.com/">to the API Stylebook</a>, and build on this important work.</p>
<p>My friend Arnaud has <a href="http://apistylebook.com/design/guidelines/">aggregated 12 of the leading API design guides out there</a> and is currently processing Google's API design guide, adding more knowledge&nbsp;to the repository. <a href="http://apistylebook.com/design/topics/">He takes each API design guide and breaks them down into common API design topics that you can consider as part of your own process, and resulting guide.</a> His work is all <a href="https://github.com/arno-di-loreto/apistylebook.com">machine readable and forkable</a> so that you can easily assemble your own guide, and get to work learning, defining, and refining--then you can submit your guide to the API Stylebook when you are ready.</p>
<p><a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/">API design</a> and <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">API definitions</a> are the top two most trafficked areas of my website in 2017, and most of 2016. API design is top of mind for API providers who are further along in their journey, and the ones who are seriously rocking it usually have some sort of guide, helping keep things consistent. If you need any help, feel free to reach out. I am not an API design expert, but I know my way around the finer details, and concepts at play, and I'm happy to help where I can. I know Arnaud is happy to answer questions as well, and if nothing else, let me help tell the story of your API design journey so that others can learn from it.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/03/02/dreaming-of-a-more-modular-event-driven-api-monetization/">I was dreaming of a more modular, event-driven approach to API monetization</a>&nbsp;the other day, and I found myself thinking more about the motivations behind each API call made, from the perspective of both the consumer and the provider. With this story I am just thinking about just the POST, or how we usually add something to a system via API--this is not always the case, but it is the common usage of the verb.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't have any numbers to support this, but the majority of APIs I encounter are GET only. The more mature API platforms have diverse stacks, using their verbs, but when companies are just getting going with their API operations, they rarely use POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. When it comes to having APIs, and incentivizing developers to generate some&nbsp;value using APIs, it seems like a company wants to encourage the creation of valuable data and content.</p>
<p>I was talking with Lufthansa Airlines the other day, and one of the things that they said to me that stood out&nbsp;when we were talking about the different APIs available, was that none of them matter if someone doesn't buy (POST) a ticket. Today, while on the phone with one of my partners, they asked if they could put my industry guides behind a lead generation form--something I allow my partners do. However, I wish more of them had a POST path for me to submit new leads, share stories, topics, and other times, for a variety of reasons--I promise would help generate value with each API call.</p>
<p>With this work I am ramping up for my <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com">API monetization</a> and <a href="http://plan.apievangelist.com">API plan</a> research, thinking about the bigger picture of how we generate value, as well as make money doing all of this. I guess that I am just lamenting the stagnation of how APIs are being designed, and deployed, with any sensible or even creative monetization strategies. To help me get through this I am going to think about what is important in my world operating API Evangelist. How I can create API endpoints for directly generating value in these areas. Things like adding a news article, sharing a story, asking questions, and other seeds of value in my world--then maybe I can provide some examples to help clarify what I'm talking about.</p>

<p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/">Google released an API design guide recently</a>. I'll be adding the design guide to the list of examples I have in <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/tools/design-guides/">my API design research</a>. The Google API design guide is pretty straight forward in its purpose, with a goal of helping, "developers design&nbsp;<strong>simple, consistent and easy-to-use</strong>&nbsp;networked APIs", but I thought it was noteworthy that they were also looking to help "converging designs of socket-based RPC APIs with HTTP-based REST APIs."</p>
<p><a href="http://www.grpc.io/">gRPC and Protocol Buffers</a> has been on my task list to learn more about for a while now, but without any projects at scale, it's probably not a task I'll find much time for anytime soon. I'll try to carve off more time to learn how folks like Google are doing it, through their guides and storytelling. One thing I did know, which Google reinforces is that"many companies use socket-based RPC APIs to carry most network traffic, which can be orders of magnitude higher than public REST APIs."</p>
<p>I like&nbsp;their approach that, "both RPC APIs and HTTP REST APIs are needed for various reasons. Ideally, an API platform should provide best support for all APIs". They also provide a note that "This Design Guide explains how to apply REST principles to API designs independent of programming language, operating system, or network protocol. It is NOT a guide solely to creating REST APIs." I like this because we are getting past the notion that API design is simply about REST--it is clearly evolving to be more about getting the work&nbsp;done&nbsp;than any single philosophy or dogma.</p>
<p><a href="http://apistylebook.com/">In addition to encouraging more API providers to craft an API design guide for their companies using API Stylebook</a>, and sharing their API design guides with the public, I will also be encouraging companies to think beyond just REST when they consider their API design best practices. I'm hoping that more companies will continue to do the hard work of getting their API design house in order&nbsp;because that means they can also begin to think about best practices when it comes to API deployment, management, testing, and the other stops along the API life cycle.</p>

<p>There have been many advances in the way that we deploy APIs in the last couple of years, but I still want more of an embeddable, push botton way to deploy generic or even more specialized APIs. This is something I've ranted about before, <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2016/09/12/where-is-the-deploy-to-aws-and-google-button/">asking where the deploy to AWS and Google buttons</a>. I'm seeing more AWS solutions emerge, <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2016/09/12/where-is-the-deploy-to-aws-and-google-button/">helping deploy from Github using AWS Codeploy</a>, and the regular number of deploy to Heroku buttons, but not the real growth I'd like to see occur--making it a drum I will keep beating&nbsp;until I get what I want.</p>
<p>I was working <a href="http://openapi.toolbox.apievangelist.com/">on my OpenAPI toolbox</a>, cataloging <a href="http://openapi.toolbox.apievangelist.com/">open source tools that put the OpenAPI specification to work</a>, and came across a deploy with Heroku button for the <a href="https://github.com/sethherr/grape-doorkeeper/">Grape Doorkeeper</a>, which helps you<em> "create an awesome versioned API, secured with OAuth2 and automatically documented"</em>. This should be the&nbsp;default for all server-side API deployment frameworks, allowing push button deployment of any open source API framework to the cloud platform of your choosing.</p>
<p>If I have my way, it won't just be API frameworks that will have deployment buttons. Specialized API designs, available in a variety of frameworks will be available for deployment with a single click of a button. We should be able to deploy a product API, or a user API, to AWS, Heroku, Google, or Microsoft, with a single click. There should be a wealth of open source templates for us to choose from on Github, with deploy buttons, and easy to follow wizards that help us set things up properly.</p>
<p>Smells like an opportunity to me. I'll have to think more about where the revenue would come from in such a model, but I'm sure it would be easy enough to upsell deployments to some premium features and services. I understand that both the areas of API design and API deployment are playing catch-up with API management at the moment, but someone needs to get to work on streamlining the API deployment button experience across all major cloud platforms&nbsp;and get to work on crafting some useful API server deployments that people can put to work instantly. #please #thankyou</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/03/02/my-developer-portal-checklist-for-a-human-services-api/">My Developer Portal Checklist For A Human Services API</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">02 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><a href="http://miami.open.211.adopta.agency/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2017_03_01_at_9.03.53_pm.png" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I was handed the URL for a human services API implementation for Miami. It was my job to now deploy a portal, documentation, and other supporting resources for the API implementation. This project is part of the work I'm doing with <a href="https://openreferral.org/">Open Referral</a> to help push forward the API conversation around the human services data specification (HSDS).</p>
<p><a href="http://portal.minimum.apievangelist.com/">I got to work forking my minimum viable API portal definition</a>, to provide a doorway for the <a href="http://miami.open.211.adopta.agency/">Miami Open211 API</a>. &nbsp;Next, I got to work on setting up a basic presence for the human services API. I started with giving the portal a title, and a basic description of what the service does, then I got to work on each of the portal elements that will help people put the data to work.</p>
<p><strong>Getting Started</strong><br />It can be hard to cut through what you need to get going with an API&nbsp;and cut through all the information available. The portal has a <a href="http://miami.open.211.adopta.agency/getting-started/">getting started page</a> providing a basic introduction, a handful of links to the documentation, code, and where to get help--<a href="https://github.com/miami-open-211/developer-portal/blob/master/_data/api-commons/api-getting-started.yaml">the page is driven from a YAML data store available in the _data folder for the repository</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Authentication</strong><br />I included an <a href="http://miami.open.211.adopta.agency/authentication/">authentication page</a> to make it clear that the API is publicly available, but also provide a placeholder to explain that we will be opening up write access to the organizations, locations, and services that are being made available--<a href="https://github.com/miami-open-211/developer-portal/blob/master/_data/api-commons/api-authentication.yaml">the page is driven from a YAML data store available in the _data folder for the repository</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong><br />Next, I wanted to always have the most <a href="http://miami.open.211.adopta.agency/frequently-asked-questions/">frequently asked questions</a> front and center where anyone can find it. I am using this page as a default place to publish any questions asked via Github, Twitter, or email. <a href="https://github.com/miami-open-211/developer-portal/blob/master/_data/api-commons/api-frequently-asked-questions.yaml">The page is driven from a YAML data store available in the _data folder for the repository</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Documentation</strong><br /><a href="http://miami.open.211.adopta.agency/documentation/">Now for the documentation</a>, the most important piece of the puzzle. I published a <a href="https://help.shopify.com/themes/liquid/basics">Liquid</a> documentation driven by <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/miami-open-211/developer-portal/master/_data/api-commons/openapi.yaml">the OpenAPI for the API</a>. With a little bit of JavaScript voodoo,&nbsp;I was able to make the documentation interactive so that you can actually try out each path, and see the JSON response--the documentation is driven by the <a href="https://github.com/miami-open-211/developer-portal/blob/master/_data/apis.yaml">APIs.json</a>&nbsp;and the <a href="https://github.com/miami-open-211/developer-portal/blob/master/_data/api-commons/openapi.yaml">OpenAPI</a> for the API.</p>
<p><strong>Code Samples</strong><br />After completing the OpenAPI definition for the API documentation, I used the machine-readable definition to generate code samples using <a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen">swagger code-gen</a>. I <a href="http://miami.open.211.adopta.agency/code/">published C#, Go, Java, JavaScript, PHP, Python, and Ruby code samples</a> to help developers get started with their projects. <a href="https://github.com/miami-open-211/client-sdks">All the language samples are published to a separate Github </a><a href="https://github.com/miami-open-211/client-sdks">repository</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://github.com/miami-open-211/developer-portal/blob/master/_data/api-commons/api-code.yaml">the page is driven&nbsp;from a YAML data store available in the _data folder for the repository</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Postman Collection</strong><br />To help jumpstart integration, <a href="http://miami.open.211.adopta.agency/postman_collection.json">I also generated and published a Postman Collection</a>, so that anyone can quickly import it into their client, and get to work playing with the API in their environment. You can do this with OpenAPI also, but Postman helps extend the possibilities--<a href="https://github.com/miami-open-211/developer-portal/blob/master/postman_collection.json">the Postman Collection is editable via its Github page</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Road Map</strong><br />Next, I published a <a href="http://miami.open.211.adopta.agency/road-map/">road map</a> so we could share what is next for the project, providing a list where developers can stay in tune with what is going to happen. <a href="https://github.com/miami-open-211/developer-portal/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22road+map%22">The road map entries are pulled from the Github issues for any entry with the road map label</a>. There is a script that can be run regularly to keep the issues in sync with the roadmap, and the <a href="https://github.com/miami-open-211/developer-portal/blob/master/_data/api-commons/api-road-map.yaml">page is driven&nbsp;from a YAML data store available in the _data folder for the repository</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Issues</strong><br />Similar to the road map, <a href="http://miami.open.211.adopta.agency/issues/">I created a page for sharing any open Github issues</a>, that are <a href="https://github.com/miami-open-211/developer-portal/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aissues">labeled 'issues'</a>, to help communicate outstanding and known issues with the platform. It stays in sync using the same script, and the <a href="https://github.com/miami-open-211/developer-portal/blob/master/_data/api-commons/api-issues.yaml">page&nbsp;is driven&nbsp;from a YAML data store available in the _data folder for the repository</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Change Log</strong><br />In addition to a road map and known issues, when these items get accomplished or fixed <a href="http://miami.open.211.adopta.agency/change-log/">they get moved to the change log</a>, keeping a complete history of everything that has changed with the platform.&nbsp;It stays in sync using the same script, and the <a href="https://github.com/miami-open-211/developer-portal/blob/master/_data/api-commons/api-change-log.yaml">page&nbsp;is driven&nbsp;from a YAML data store available in the _data folder for the repository</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Status Page</strong><br />Beyond the resources to get up and running with documentation, code samples, and a road map, issues, and change log to stay in tune with the platform, <a href="http://miami.open.211.adopta.agency/status/">I wanted a status page keeping an eye on things</a>. I signed up for a monitoring service called <a href="http://apiscience.com/">API Science</a> (which I highly recommend), and imported the OpenAPI definition, and had monitors to keep an eye on things and make sure the API stays up. The page is generated from an&nbsp;embeddable JavaScript widget&nbsp;and is updated using the API Science API.</p>
<p><strong>Terms of Service</strong><br /><a href="http://miami.open.211.adopta.agency/terms-of-service/">For the terms of service</a>, I just grabbed an open source copy from Wikidot, providing a baseline place to start when it comes to the TOS for the API-<a href="https://github.com/miami-open-211/developer-portal/blob/master/terms-of-service/index.html">the terms of service is editable via its Github page</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Privacy Policy</strong><br />Similar to the terms of service&nbsp;I just grabbed an <a href="http://miami.open.211.adopta.agency/privacy-policy/">open source privacy policy from Wikidot</a>, providing a baseline place to start when it comes to a <a href="http://miami.open.211.adopta.agency/privacy-policy/">privacy policy for the API</a>-<a href="https://github.com/miami-open-211/developer-portal/blob/master/privacy-policy/index.html">the privacy policy is editable via its Github page</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Developer Blog</strong><br /><a href="http://miami.open.211.adopta.agency/blog/">The blog for the project</a> is driven by the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll framework</a> for <a href="https://pages.github.com/">the developer portal hosted on Github Pages</a>. <a href="https://github.com/miami-open-211/developer-portal/tree/master/_posts">To manage the blog entries, you just add or update pages in the _posts folder for the website</a>. All entries in the _post folder are listed in chronological order on the blog page for the developer portal.</p>
<p><strong>Github</strong><br />This developer portal runs 100% on Github and leverages the potential of Jekyll when running on Github. The API is hosted on Heroku and run by someone else, but the developer portal is a static website, completely editable via Github through the web interface, API, or locally with the desktop client. Github also provides much of the support framework for the project, driving the roadmap, issues, change log, and 1/3 of the support options for developers--the entire site is driven from the _data store, with the website just being a Liquid-driven Jekyll template.</p>
<p><strong>OpenAPI</strong><br /><a href="https://github.com/miami-open-211/developer-portal/blob/master/_data/api-commons/openapi.yaml">This developer portal is defined by its OpenAPI definition</a>. It drives the documentation, generated the code samples, fired up the API Science monitors, and is the central contract defining the APIs operation. I will be keeping the OpenAPI up to date, and using it as the central truth for the API and its operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>APIs.json</strong><br /><a href="https://github.com/miami-open-211/developer-portal/blob/master/_data/apis.yaml">The portal is entirely indexed using APIs.json</a>, providing a single machine-readable definition of the API and its operations. All the supporting pages of the API are linked to in the index, and their contents&nbsp;and data are all machine-readable YAML and JSON. The APIs.json provides access to the OpenAPI which describes the surface area of the API, as well as providing links to all it's supporting operations.</p>
<p><strong>What Is Next?</strong><br />I'm going to put things down for a couple days. We still need some FAQs entered, and the content needs fluffing up and editing. Then we'll invite other folks to take a look at. Then I will get to work on the POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE paths, and once those are certified I will push as part of the OpenAPI, regenerate the code samples, and turn on the ability for people to get involved not just reading data, but also potentially adding and updating data in the database--making things a group effort.</p>
<p>I'm going to take what I have here, and fork it into a new project, making it a baseline demo portal for <a href="http://openreferral.org">Open Referral</a>. My goal is to have a downloadable, forkable API portal that is well documented, and anyone providing an HSDS compliant API can put to use for their project. I just wanted to take a moment and gather my thoughts on what I did and share the approach I took with you.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Mar 2017</span>
        <p>I used to have a Github repository dedicated to Swagger tooling and implementations, but I took it down after Swagger was donated to the Linux Foundation. I've rebooted it as <a href="http://openapi.toolbox.apievangelist.com/">my OpenAPI Toolbox</a>, providing <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/openapi-toolbox">a single Github repository for managing an active list of open source tooling built on top of the OpenAPI specification</a>.</p>
<p>Here is a snapshot of my toolbox of <a href="https://www.openapis.org/">OpenAPI</a>-driven solutions, as it stands today. This site is a Jekyll-driven website running on Github, using Github Pages. The tools in this toolbox are driven by a YAML file in <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/openapi-toolbox/tree/master/_data">the _data folder for this repository</a>, with the HTML pages driven using Liquid.</p>
<p>Here are the tools organized by type of implementation (something that is evolving quickly):</p>

<p>This project is <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/openapi-toolbox">forkable using the Github repository</a>, and <a href="/data/tools.json">accessible as JSON</a>. If you have a tool you think should be added, or there is something that needs fixing, <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/openapi-toolbox/issues">you can submit an issue on the Github repository</a>, or submit a pull request. It is meant to be a community project, designed to be forkable, shareable, and machine-readable.</p>
<p>I've just started adding the tools I have in my database. I only have 37 so far, but will be adding more as I have time. Once I have it up to date, I will start thinking about other ways to slice and dice the tools, to better understand what is being built on the OpenAPI specification, what tools are being built on the upcoming 3.0 version, as well as working to identify where the gaps and opportunities are for developing tooling.</p>

<p>I was learning about the approach Amazon has taken with <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/02/28/the-aws-serverless-api-portal/">their serverless API developer portal</a>, and <a href="/2017/03/01/a-machine-readable-definition-for-your-aws-api-plan/">highlighting their approach to API plans</a>, and couldn't help but think there was more to it all than just rate limiting your API. Amazon's approach to API plans is in alignment with other API management providers, allowing you to deploy your APIs, meter, rate limit, and charge for access to your API--standard business of APIs stuff.</p>
<p>Controlling access to a variety of API resources is something that has been well-defined over the last decade by API management providers like <a href="http://apis.how/ake3nxbapm">3Scale</a>, and now <a href="http://apis.how/zflfesymzk">Tyk</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://apis.how/bgdteovduo">DreamFactory</a>. They provide you with all the tools you need to define access to APIs, and meter access based upon a wide variety of parameters. While I haven't seen the type of growth I expected to see in this area, we have seen a significant amount of growth because API management providers are helping to standardize things--something that will grow significantly because of availability&nbsp;from cloud providers like AWS, Microsoft, and Google.</p>
<p>We have a lot of work ahead of us, standardizing how we charge for API consumption at scale. We have even more work ahead of us to realize that we can turn all of this on its head, and start paying for API consumption at scale. I do not understand how we've gotten so hung up on the click and the view, when there are so many&nbsp;other richer, and more meaningful actions already occurring&nbsp;every second, of each day online. We should be identifying these opportunities, then paying and incentivizing developers to consume APIs in most valuable way possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With modern approaches to API management, we already have the infrastructure in place. We need to just start thinking about our APIs differently. We also need to get better at leveraging POST, PUT, and PATCH, as well as GET, when it comes to paying for consumption. Imagine a sort of event driven API affiliate layer to the&nbsp;web, mobile, device, and even conversational interfaces--where developers get paid for making the most meaningful events occur. It makes the notion of paying per view or click seem really, really, shit simple.</p>
<p>Anyways, just a thought I needed to get out. The lack of innovation, and abundance of greed when it comes to API monetization and planning always leaves me depressed. I wish someone would move the needle forward with some sort of modular, event-driven&nbsp;API monetization framework--allowing some different dimensions to be added to the API economy.</p>

<p>I come across more companies managing their <a href="http://openapis.org">OpenAPI</a> definition as a single Github repository. One example of this is from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/">the New York Times</a>, who as <a href="https://github.com/NYTimes/public_api_specs">the API definitions for their platform available as its own Github repository</a>. It demonstrates the importance of maintaining your API definitions separately from any particular implementation, such as just your documentation.</p>
<p>You can find Individual OpenAPIs for their&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/NYTimes/public_api_specs/tree/master/archive_api">archive_api</a>, <a href="https://github.com/NYTimes/public_api_specs/commit/dd0716a5adc93f95eb4b065ddd8601ffd17cb09c">updated description</a>, <a href="https://github.com/NYTimes/public_api_specs/tree/master/article_search">article_search</a>,<a href="https://github.com/NYTimes/public_api_specs/tree/master/books_api">books_api</a>, <a href="https://github.com/NYTimes/public_api_specs/tree/master/community">community</a>, <a href="https://github.com/NYTimes/public_api_specs/tree/master/geo_api">geo_api</a>, <a href="https://github.com/NYTimes/public_api_specs/tree/master/most_popular_api">most_popular_api</a>, <a href="https://github.com/NYTimes/public_api_specs/tree/master/movie_reviews">movie_reviews</a>, <a href="https://github.com/NYTimes/public_api_specs/tree/master/semantic_api">semantic_api</a>, <a href="https://github.com/NYTimes/public_api_specs/tree/master/times_tags">times_tags</a>, <a href="https://github.com/NYTimes/public_api_specs/tree/master/timeswire">timeswire</a>, <a href="https://github.com/NYTimes/public_api_specs/tree/master/top_stories">top_stories</a>&nbsp;broken down into separate folders within the Github repository. The NYT also provides markdown documentation, alongside the machine-readable OpenAPI definition in each folder, helping make sure things are human-readable.</p>
<p>It just makes sense to manage your API definitions this way. It's more than just documentation. When you do this, you are taking advantage of the repository and version control features of Github, but you also open things up for participation through forking and pull requests. The resulting definition and machine readable contract can then be injected anywhere into the integration&nbsp;and API lifecycle, internally or externally.</p>
<p>I personally like it when companies manage their API definitions in this way. It gives me a central truth to work with when profiling their operations, something that will be used across my research and storytelling. The more you describe your APIs in this way, the more chance I will be writing about them&nbsp;and including them across my work.</p>

<p>I was playing around with the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/blog/2309-introducing-topics">new Github topics</a>, and found that it provides an interesting look at the API space, one that I'm hoping will continue to evolve, and maybe I can influence.</p>
<p>I typed 'api-' into Github's topic tagging tool for my repository, and after I tagged each of my research areas with appropriate tags, I set out exploring these layers of Github by clicking on each tag. It is something that became quite a wormhole of API exploration.</p>
<p>I had to put it down, as I could spend hours looking through the repositories, but I wanted to create a machine-readable mapping to my existing API research areas, that I could use to regularly keep an eye on these slices of the Github pie--in an automated way.</p>
<p><a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/"><strong>Definitions</strong></a>&nbsp;- These are the topics I'm adding to my monitoring of the API space when it comes to API definitions. I thought it was interesting how folks are using Github to manage their API definitions.</p>

<p>I like how OpenAPI is starting to branch out into separate areas, as well as how this area touches on almost every other area&nbsp;liste here. I am going to work to help shape the tags present based on the definitions, templates, and tooling I find on Github in my work.</p>
<p><a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/"><strong>Design</strong></a>&nbsp;- There was only&nbsp;one API design related item, but is something I expect to expand rapidly as I dive into this area further.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>api-design</strong>&nbsp;(<a href="https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aapi-design&amp;type=Repositories">search via Github topics</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>I know of a number of projects that should be tagged and added to the area of API design, as well as have a number of sub-areas I'd like to see included as relevant API design tags.</p>
<p><a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com/"><strong>Deployment</strong></a>&nbsp;- Deployment was a little tougher to get a handle on. There are many different ways to deploy an API, but these are the ones I've identified so far.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>api-deployment</strong>&nbsp;(<a href="https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aapi-deployment&amp;type=Repositories">search via Github topics</a>)</li>
<li><strong>api-server</strong>&nbsp;(<a href="https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aapi-server&amp;type=Repositories">search via Github topics</a>)</li>

<li><strong>api-server</strong>&nbsp;(<a href="https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aapi-server&amp;type=Repositories">search via Github topics</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>I know I will be adding some other areas to this area quickly. Tracking on&nbsp;database, containerized, and serverless approaches to API deployment.</p>
<p><a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/"><strong>Management</strong></a>&nbsp;- There were two topics that jumped out to me for inclusion in my API management research.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>api-management</strong>&nbsp;(<a href="https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aapi-management&amp;type=Repositories">search via Github topics</a>)</li>
<li><strong>api-key</strong>&nbsp;(<a href="https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aapi-key&amp;type=Repositories">search via Github topics</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>As with all the other areas, I will be harassing some of the common API management providers I know to tag their repositories appropriately, so that they show up in these searches.</p>
<p><a href="http://documentation.apievangelist.com/"><strong>Documentation</strong></a>&nbsp;- There are always a number of different perspectives on what constitutes API documentation, but these are a few of these I've found so far.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>api-console</strong>&nbsp;(<a href="https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aapi-console&amp;type=Repositories">search via Github topics</a>)</li>
<li><strong>api-documentation</strong>&nbsp;(<a href="https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aapi-documentation&amp;type=Repositories">search via Github topics</a>)</li>
<li><strong>api-error</strong>&nbsp;(<a href="https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aapi-error&amp;type=Repositories">search via Github topics</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>I think that API console overlaps with API clients, but it works here as well. I will work to find a way to separate out the documentation tools, from the documentation implementations.</p>
<p><a href="http://sdk.apievangelist.com/"><strong>SDK</strong></a>&nbsp;- It is hard to identify what is an SDK. It is a sector of the space I've seen renewed innovation, as well as bending of the definition of what is a development kit.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>api-sdk</strong>&nbsp;(<a href="https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aapi-sdk&amp;type=Repositories">search via Github topics</a>)</li>
<li><strong>api-wrapper</strong>&nbsp;(<a href="https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aapi-wrapper&amp;type=Repositories">search via Github topics</a>)</li>
<li><strong>api-client</strong>&nbsp;(<a href="https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aapi-client&amp;type=Repositories">search via Github topics</a>)</li>
<li><strong>api-bindings</strong>&nbsp;(<a href="https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aapi-bindings&amp;type=Repositories">search via Github topics</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>I will be looking to identify language-specific variations as part of this mapping to API SDKs available on Github, making discoverable through topic searches.</p>
<p><a href="http://portal.apievangelist.com/"><strong>API Portal</strong></a>&nbsp;- It was good to see wicked.haufe.io as part of an API portal topic search. I know of a couple of other implementations that should be present, helping people see this growing area of API deployment and management.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>api-portal</strong>&nbsp;(<a href="https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aapi-portal&amp;type=Repositories">search via Github topics</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach to providing Github driven API templates is the future of both the technical and business side of API operations. It is the seed for continuous integration across all stops along the API lifecycle.</p>
<p><a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com/"><strong>API Discovery</strong></a>&nbsp;- Currently it is just my research in the API discovery topic search, but it is where I'm putting this area my work down. I was going to add all my research areas, but I think that will make for a good story in the future.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>api-catalog</strong>&nbsp;(<a href="https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aapi-catalog&amp;type=Repositories">search via Github topics</a>)</li>
<li><strong>api-discovery</strong>&nbsp;(<a href="https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aapi-discovery&amp;type=Repositories">search via Github topics</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>API discovery is one of the areas I'm looking to stimulate with this Github topics work. I'm going to be publishing separate repositories for each of the API I've profiled as part of my monitoring of the API space, and highlighting those providers who do it as well. We need more API providers to publish their API definitions to Github, making it available to be applied at every other stop along the API lifecycle.</p>
<p>I've long used Github as a discovery tool. Tracking on the Github accounts of companies, organizations, institutions, agencies and individuals is the best way to find the meaningful things going on with APIs. Github topics just adds another dimension to this discovery process, where I don't have to always do the discovery, and other people can tag their repositories, and they'll float up on the radar. Github repo activity, stars, and forks just give&nbsp;an added dimensions to this conversation.</p>
<p>I will have to figure out how to harass people I know about properly tagging their repos. I may even submit a Github issue for some of the ones I think are important enough. Maybe Github will allow users to tag other people's projects, adding another dimension to the conversation, while giving consumers a voice as well. <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/github-topics-mapping/blob/master/_data/mapping.yaml">I will update the YAML mapping for this project as I find new Github topics that should be mapped to my existing API research</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">01 Mar 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2017_02_26_at_7.12.16_pm.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was learning about the <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-api-gateway-developer-portal">AWS Serverless Developer </a><a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-api-gateway-developer-portal">Portal</a>, and found their API plan layer to be an interesting evolution in how we define the access tiers of our APIs. There were a couple different layers of AWS's approach to deploying APIs that I found interesting, including the AWS marketplace integration, but I wanted to stop for a moment and focus in on their API plan approach.</p>
<p>Using the AWS API Gateway you can establish a variety of API plans, with the underlying mechanics of that plan configurable via the AWS API Gateway user interface or the AWS API Gateway API. In the documentation for the&nbsp;AWS Serverless Developer&nbsp;Portal, they include a JSON snippet of the configuration of the plan for each API being deployed.</p>
<p>This reminds me that I needed to take another look at <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">my API plan research</a>, and take the plan configuration, rate limit, and other&nbsp;service composition API definitions I have, and aggregate their schema into a single snapshot. <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/2016/02/13/my-tooling-and-api-for-gathering-and-organizing-the-details-of-the-plans-and-pricing-for-apis/">It has been a while since I worked on my machine-readable API plan definition</a>, and there are now enough API management solutions with an API layer out there, I should be able to pull a wider sampling of the&nbsp;schema in play. I'm not in the business of defining what the definition should be, I am only looking to aggregate what others are doing.</p>
<p>I am happy to see more folks sharing machine-readable <a href="http://openapis.org">OpenAPI</a> definitions describing the surface area of their APIs. As this work continues to grow we are going to have to also start sharing machine-readable definitions of the monetization, plan, and access layers of our API operations. After I identify the schema in play for some of the major <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com">API management</a> providers I track on, I'm going to invest more work into my standard API plan definition to make the access levels of <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs more discoverable using APIs.json</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Feb 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2017_02_25_at_6.02.50_pm.png" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was reading about Experian the credit score company "<a href="http://diginomica.com/2017/02/22/experian-shrugs-off-size-to-go-nimbly-api-economy/">ventures nimbly into the API economy</a>" this week. I'm happy to see any company begin their API journey, especially companies whose important algorithms impact our lives in such a major way. APIs are critical when it comes to shining a light on how algorithms work and don't work.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://www.experian.com/connect/api/">Experian developer page</a>, <em>"the Experian Connect API provides easy access to embed credit functionality on your websites and mobile apps. Consumer-empowered sharing allows you to create products and services for previously unreachable markets"</em>. Sadly I can't see much about the API itself, as you have to fill out a form and request access to see documentation&nbsp;or anything beyond just a basic description.</p>
<p>The Experian Connect API says you get access to credit scores and reports, but most of it sounds like your standard marketing speak. I find API documentation and actually playing with an API provide a much more honest take on what's going on. Their approach reflects what I've seen from other very secretive companies who are used to maintaining tight control over their algorithms, processes, and partnerships.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another aspect of the Experian Connect API I noticed as I read was it doesn't focus on solutions for the end-users who is being scored and reported on, it is designed for businesses looking to pull reports on people for a variety of purposes. When you read the story about the Experian API, and the description on the Experian developer page, it is all very business focused--centering on the opportunity for businesses, not the people it scores and ranks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Credit scores are one of the OG big data companies, long tracking information on people, and selling access to business and the government. While Experian's venture into the API economy is worth noting, I'm guessing their API journey won't be a very public one. It's just not in their DNA. I wish they would see the value of incentivizing their partners to better serve the humans at the center of the service, and be more transparent about their algorithm(s), but I'm not going to hold my breath.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not all APIs will be open by default. All we can do is tell stories that help convince companies to open up their APIs, be more transparent, allowing their algorithms to be more observable by everyone who impacted along the way.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/02/28/the-aws-serverless-api-portal/">The AWS Serverless API Portal</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">28 Feb 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/aws_serverless_portal.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was looking through the Github accounts for Amazon Web Services and came across <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-api-gateway-developer-portal">their Serverless API Portal</a>--a pretty functional example of a forkable developer portal for your API, running on a variety of AWS services. It's a pretty interesting implementation&nbsp;because in addition to the tech of your API management it also helps you with the business side of things.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The AWS Serverless Developer Portal <em>"is a reference implementation for a developer portal application that allows users to register, discover, and subscribe to your API Products (API Gateway Usage Plans), manage their API Keys, and view their usage metrics for your APIs..[]..it also&nbsp;<span>supports subscription/unsubscription through a SaaS product offering through the AWS Marketplace."--p</span></em>roviding a pretty compelling API portal solution running on AWS.</p>
<p>There are a couple things I think are pretty noteworthy:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Application Backend (/lambdas/backend) - </strong>The application backend is a Lambda function built on the aws-serverless-express library. The backend is responsible for login/registration, API subscription/unsubscription, usage metrics, and handling product subscription redirects from AWS Marketplace.</li>
<li><strong>Marketplace SaaS Setup Instructions -</strong> You can sell your SaaS product through AWS Marketplace and have the developer portal manage the subscription/unsubscription workflows. API Gateway will automatically provide authorization and metering for your product and subscribers will be automatically billed through AWS Marketplace</li>
<li><strong>AWS Marketplace SNS Listener Function (Optional) (/listener) - </strong>The listener Lambda function will be triggered when customers subscribe or unsubscribe to your product through the AWS Marketplace console. AWS Marketplace will generate a unique SNS Topic where events will be published for your product.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the required infrastructure we'll need to get to what I've been talking about for some time with my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/30/what-will-it-take-to-sell-my-api-as-a-wholesale-resource/">wholesale API</a> and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/01/28/virtualized-api-stacks/">virtual API stack</a> stories. Amazon is providing you with the infrastructure you need to set up the storefront for your APIs, providing the management layer you will need, including monetization via their marketplace. This is a retail layer, but because your&nbsp;infrastructure is setup in this way, there is no reason you can't sell all or part of your setup to other wholesale customers, using the same AWS marketplace.</p>
<p>I had AWS marketplace on my list of solutions to better understand for some time now, but the AWS Serverless Developer Portal really begins to connect the dots for me. If you can sell access to your API infrastructure using this model, you can also sell your API infrastructure to others using this model. I will have to set up some infrastructure using this approach to better flush out how AWS infrastructure&nbsp;and open templates like this serverless developer portal can help facilitate&nbsp;a more versatile, virtualized, and wholesale API lifecycle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/generate-your-own-api-gateway-developer-portal/">a more detailed walkthrough of how to get going with the AWS Serverless Developer Portal</a>, helping you think through the details. I am a big fan of these types of templates--forkable Github repositories, with a blueprint you can follow to achieve a specific API deployment, management, or any&nbsp;other lifecycle objective.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Feb 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/api_observability_lighthouse.jpg" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I have had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observability">the Wikipedia page for Observability</a> open in a browser tab for weeks now. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/10/25/thinking-about-an-api-observability-stack/">I learned about the concept from Stripe a while back</a> and is something that I am looking to help define APIs from an external vantage point. In this world of fake news and wild promises of artificial intelligence and machine learning, we need these black boxes to be as observable as they can--I am hoping that APIs can be one of the tools in this observability toolbox.</p>
<p>Stripe is approaching this concept from the inside, with a focus on stability and reliability of their API operations. I am focusing on this concept from the outside, to "measure how well internal states of a system can be inferred by knowledge of its <span style="text-decoration: underline;">external outputs</span>". More of a regulatory, auditing, and journalistic way of thinking, but in the API way of doing things. Some of this is about understanding, but some of it is also about holding providers accountable for what they are peddling.</p>
<p>The other day I mapped out what API monitoring means to me, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/02/16/trying-to-define-api-awareness/">rebranding it as what I'd prefer to call API awareness</a>. I went through the elements I use to understand what is going on with APIs across the sector, but this time I am thinking about them in terms of observability. Meaning, not what I'm doing to be aware of APIs, but what is expected from providers to meet (my) minimum viable definition of a platform being observable.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discovery -</strong> Do APIs exist? Are they easily discoverable? Are they public? Can anyone put them to use?<br />&nbsp;
<ul>
<li><strong>Applications</strong>&nbsp;- Find new applications built on top of APIs.</li>

<li><strong>Visualizations</strong>&nbsp;- What visualizations are available for making sense of any single API or collections of APIs, providing easy to understand, or perhaps more complex visualizations that bring meaning to the dashboard.</li>
<li><strong>Integration</strong>&nbsp;- What integration platform as a service (iPaaS), continuous integration, and other orchestration solutions are available for helping to make sense of API operations within this world.</li>
</ul>
<p>I do not think APIs being present automatically mean a company, it's data, content, or algorithms are observable. This list represents what I feel enables and empowers observability, and are the key areas where I think companies need to work on when it comes to ensuring their operations are more observable. I pulled this list of elements from my own toolbox for monitoring the API sector&nbsp;but is trimmed down specifically for platform operators who might be thinking about how they can make things more observable for everyone involved, internal or external.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are like me and operating outside the corporate firewall, this list represents the areas you should be encouraging platform operators to invest in when it comes to pulling back the current a little bit more. Different folks will read this post and walk away with different takes on what observability might mean. Some will view it as a good thing, while others will see it is as API driven regulatory interference. Your take probably has more to do with your position in the conversation, than it does to the observability of anything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now for some concrete examples. What is the observability of the Facebook news algorithm? What is the observability of the Twitter feed? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_score">What is the observability of our credit score?</a> <a href="http://doc.wi.gov/about/doc-overview/office-of-the-secretary/office-of-reentry/compas-assessment-tool">How observable is COMPAS as it evaluates its risk score for whether a criminal offender will reoffend?</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/Chicago/food-inspections-evaluation">How observable is Chicago's food inspection algorithm?</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)">How observable is the RSA algorithm which drives cryptography?</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_trading">How observable is algorithmic trading across stock markets?</a>&nbsp;These are just a handful of some relatable algorithms&nbsp;when in reality there are numerous micro impacts of algorithms felt each moment, of each day, as we navigate our worlds.</p>
<p>I do not think there are easy answers when it comes to <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2016/08/04/pushing-for-more-algorithmic-transparency-using-apis/">algorithmic transparency</a>. This is just my attempt to understand how APIs can be put to work making the algorithms that are increasingly governing our reality more observable. I spend a lot of time trying to make sense of the very obscure things like cloud and social. What are they? What can you do with them? Do they do what they promise? When do things change? <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/02/16/trying-to-define-api-awareness/">I shared a version of this list for folks on the outside to develop API awareness</a>. Now,, this is my recommendations for what companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies can do to make the data, content, and algorithms they use more observable--not just for our benefit, for yours as well.</p>

        <span class="post-date">27 Feb 2017</span>
        <p>If you are selling a service you should have an API. It is something you hear me talk about a lot here on the blog. I push on this subject because it is important, and there are numerous API service providers out there who do not have an API&nbsp;or choose to not make them available. In a DevOps,&nbsp;continuous integration world, we need the entire stack to have APIs--making our API platforms programmatic, just like the data, content, and algorithms we are making available via the APIs we are deploying.</p>
<p>If you need an example of this in the wild, <a href="http://tyk.management.apievangelist.com/">you don't have to look much further than my partner in crime Tyk</a>, who have a simple API for their API gateway--no matter where you deploy the gateway, you can manage it using it's APIs. The&nbsp;Tyk&nbsp;API Gateway API provides you with a base set of paths for you to manage your gateway.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/company/logos/tyk_io_logo.png" alt="" width="150" align="left" /></p>
<p>An open source, lightweight, fast and scalable API Gateway. Set rate limiting, request throttling, and auto-renewing request quotas to manage how your users access your API. Tyk supports access tokens, HMAC request signing, basic authentication and OAuth 2.0 to integrate old and new services easily. Tyk can record and store detailed analytics which can be segmented by user, error, endpoint and client ID across multiple APIs and versions. Integrate your existing or new applications with Tyk using a simple REST API, Tyk even support hot-reloads so you can introduce new services without downtime.</p>

<p>The Tyk&nbsp;API Gateway provides a base set of API management features that can be deployed in the cloud, on-premise, or on-device. Making the key ingredients for API management programmable.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2017_02_25_at_9.00.37_pm.png" alt="" width="75%" align="center" /></p>
<p>Tyk's&nbsp;API Gateway represents just one component in any API operation's toolbox. <a href="https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-swagger-definitions/blob/master/tyk_gateway_api.yml">Tyk also provides an OpenAPI for the API gateway</a>&nbsp;making things much more plug and play as part of any API life cycle--something <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kinlane/tyk-api-management/master/_data/api-commons/tyk/apis.json">I've made even more discoverable using APIs.json</a>. Their approach provides a nice blueprint that all API providers should be following--well-defined APIs for all your services (open source if you can ;-).</p>
<p>I track on any service or tool I include in my research like it has an API. If it does have an API, I profile it like I did with Tyk. If it doesn't, I will harass them until they have an API. If you are building tools, or selling services to the API space, you should have an API, as well as provide OpenAPI and APIs.json definitions for all your goods.</p>

<p>I am approaching seven years doing API Evangelist. <a href="http://apievangelist.com">I have over 70 areas of my core API lifecycle research available on the website</a>&nbsp;and have four of those areas (<a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com">definitions</a>, <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">design</a>, <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">deployment</a>, &amp; <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com">management</a>) that I've been publishing industry guides for the last couple of years. In 2017, I want to take those guides, and hopefully a handful of other research areas to the next level. My guides have always been about the&nbsp;quantity of information, over the quality of the final guide. I want to turn that on its head and focus on the&nbsp;quality of information and presentation over the quantity, publishing an executive summary of each of my API industry research areas.</p>
<p>With my new guide, I am looking to add a touch of design, but I'm also looking to expand&nbsp;the exposure and storytelling opportunities for my partners in the space. Using Adobe In Design I have been able to handle the design enhancements, but I am in need of help making sure my industry guide are ready for consumption by a wider, and more mainstream audience--this is where you come in. I need your feedback. Seriously, I need you to help me with everything copy editing to being&nbsp;an overall critic--let me know what works and what doesn't--I'm looking to make this a community affair.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist/definitions/">My API Definition research operates as a Github repository</a>, providing access to the data and content behind each area. I use <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist/definitions/issues">the Github Issues</a> for each of my API research like I would for any other project I'm managing using Github. If you have the time, I would be grateful if you would take look at my API definition guide&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist/definitions/issues">and submit a single Github issue with your&nbsp;feedback</a>,. I'm even willing to give some exposure in each edition, thanking the folks who helped out in the 'about page' of the guide. Also, if you help out enough I'd be willing to give one of the sponsor slots to your company, project, product, or service--seriously, I want this to be a community effort.</p>
<p>After&nbsp;a couple of weeks of beta testing each guide, and gathering feedback, I will be packaging the guide up for distribution through my partners, Amazon, and other distribution channels. I would really appreciate your help in fine tuning my work&nbsp;and making it something worthy of a more mainstream audience. I'll be repeating this process with my other industry guides for API design, deployment, and management. This will open up even further opportunities for exposure (if you are into that kind of thing). While the research portions of these guides are derived from my research, I'm looking for the stories, overall tone, and sponsor slots to be a community thing, <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist/definitions/issues">so submit a Github issue</a>, and let me know what you think--I really, really appreciate it.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/02/27/an-example-of-an-api-service-provider-using-hypermedia/">An Example Of An API Service Provider Using Hypermedia</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">27 Feb 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/aws-api-gateway-icon.png" alt="" width="30%" align="right" /></p>
<p>There&nbsp;is a growing number of hypermedia APIs available in the wild these days. However there aren't a lot of examples of hypermedia API service providers making the API lifecycle&nbsp;more dynamic and living. When people ask me for examples of hypermedia APIs out there I like to have a handful of URLs I can share with them, providing a diverse set they can consider as part of their own operations.</p>
<p>One really good example of an API service provider putting hypermedia to use is Amazon Web Services--specifically with <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/api-reference/">the AWS API Gateway</a>. &nbsp;AWS describes it best in the documentation&nbsp;for the gateway API:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The Amazon API Gateway web service is a resource-based API that uses Hypertext Application Language (HAL). HAL provides a standard way for expressing the resources and relationships of an API as hyperlinks. Using HAL, you use HTTP methods (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE) to submit requests and receive information about the API in the response. Applications can use the information returned to explore the functionality of the API.</em></p>
<p>If you have used other common AWS APIs like EC2 or S3, then you know that they aren't the best designed APIs out there. They provide a lot of functionality&nbsp;but leave a lot to be desired when it comes to the actual design. The AWS API Gateway API is a well designed, highly functional API for managing the operations of your API. With each API call, you get the desired response, along with a collection of links defining what else is possible.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/7e8fd8654b0b76eeda769862c59cb10d.js"></script>
<p>I wish that all tools in our API toolbox were designed like the AWS API Gateway is. In this single API call you can see how hypermedia contributes to the life cycle of any API being managed. You can manage access, and evolve into a staging or production environment, and the other possibilities available when each resource is put to work. Instead of having to go back to the API documentation to learn what options are available, they are given to you in a tailored collection of links.</p>
<p><a href="http://hypermedia.apievangelist.com/apis/">I have already added the AWS API Gateway to my list of hypermedia APIs</a>, but I will now also be referencing as a blueprint of an API service provider who is putting hypermedia to work in their API design. I think hypermedia helps make applications be more&nbsp;flexible&nbsp;and resilient, and I also think hypermedia does the same at the API level, allowing us to more honestly manage change across the API lifecycle.</p>

<p>I was playing with one of the <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">API deployment solutions</a> that I track on, appropriately called <a href="https://api-platform.com/">API Platform</a>. It is an open source PHP solution for defining, designing, and deploying your linked data APIs. I thought their list of features provided a pretty sophisticated look at what an API can be, and was something I wanted to share.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD</a>&nbsp;API in minutes</li>
<li><a href="http://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hydra-cg.com/">Hydra</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html">HAL</a>&nbsp;native support</li>

<li>100% open source (MIT)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a couple of key elements here. API definition-driven with JSON-LD, Hydra, HAL, and OpenAPI Spec out of box. Containerized. Schema.org FTW! JWT, and OAuth. OWASP's security checklist. Postman Ready! These features make for a pretty compelling approach to <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">designing</a> and <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">deploying</a> your APIs. While I see some of these features in other platforms, it is the first with an open source solution possessing such an impressive resume.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm going to take this list and add to my list of API design, and deployment building blocks in my research. These are features that other API deployment solutions should be considering as part of their offering. This approach to API deployment may not be the right answer for every type of API, but I know many data and content focused APIs thatwouldl benefit significantly from a deployment solution like <a href="https://api-platform.com/">API Platform</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Feb 2017</span>
        <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-two-arrows.png" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p>I was having a conversation about whether I should be putting my API definition or my API design work first--which comes earlier in the lifecycle of an API? The conclusion was to put definition first because you need a common set of definitions to work with when designing your API(s). You need definitions like HTTP and HTTP/2. In, 2017 you should be employing definitions like OpenAPI Spec, and JSON Schema. These definitions help set the tone of your API design process.</p>
<p>In my opinion, one of the biggest benefits of designing, developing, and operating APIs on the web has been forcing developers to pick up their heads and pay attention to what everybody else is doing and wanting. I suffer from this. Doing web APIs, providing my own, and consuming 3rd party APIs forces me to pay attention to providers and consumers outside my bubble--this is good.</p>
<p>Common definitions help us elevate the design of our APIs by leveraging common concepts, standards, and schema. Every time you employ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601</a>, you have to think about folks in another time zone. Every time you use ISO 4217, you have to think about people who buy and sell their products and services in a different currency than you. When you use <a href="http://schema.org/">Schema.org</a>, your <a href="http://schema.org/PostalAddress">postal addresses considers the world beyond just US zip codes,</a> and consider a world wid web of commerce.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com">I am placing definitions before design in my API research listing</a>. In reality, I think this is just a cycle. Common definitions feed my design process, and the more experienced I get with design, the more robust my toolbox of API definitions gets. Ultimately this depends on what I'm calling a definition, but for the sake of this story <a href="http://webconcepts.info/">I am considering the building blocks of the web as the first line of definition</a><a href="http://webconcepts.info/">s</a>, then secondarily the definitions that are using OpenAPI Spec and JSON Schema as the next line of definitions. Definitions influence my design process, and the design process is refining the definitions that I am putting to work. </p>

<p>I have a regular call with a really smart API person who is trying to move forward a really cool project for the API space. It is some thought provoking voodoo and I need to be able to write about it--this is how I flush out my thoughts and move forward. He is not quite ready to talk about his project publicly, so I will just talk about and explore in terms of my <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist research</a> and how it applies to the area(s) of the API space he is looking to make an impact.</p>
<p>This topic spans several areas of my <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API research</a>, but if I had to give it a single label I would call it API awareness. When you hear me talk about my monitoring the API space, API awareness is the result. I wanted to try and communicate this from my vantage point but also share with other analysts, practitioners, and even the average individual online today. This is my attempt to distil my approach to monitoring the API space and establishing a sustained awareness of APIs at any level.</p>
<p><strong>Individual ("Normals")</strong><br />It may sound crazy to you, but everyone should be API aware. No, they should be paying attention to APIs like I do, or even at the level of the average individual working in the tech sector, but they should have a baseline awareness, and here is my attempt at quantifying that:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>APIs Exist </strong>- Everyone should be aware that APIs exist, and hopefully have one or two examples of what they can do in their business or personal lives -- even if it's' just pulling tweets, photos, or getting news updates via an RSS feed.</li>
<li><strong>API Integration</strong> - Everyone should be aware that they can move data and content between the online services they use and depend on. If you know APIs exist and are aware of services like <a href="http://zapier.com">Zapier</a> or <a href="http://datafire.io">Datafire</a>, you will be more successful in what you do online.
<ul>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Data Portability -</strong> All online services should allow for the downloading of their data, allowing for the portability of all users data and content.</li>
<li><strong>API Discovery - </strong>With a low-level awareness of APIs and what is possible, the average individual should regularly be introduced to new APIs, and be given simple tooling and services for helping them in their discovery.
<ul>
<li><strong>Applications</strong> - Everyone should get exposed to what other people are doing with APIs, and be informed about new and interesting ways to get things done for fun or business.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Individuals</strong> - Individuals within a company, institution, or online that can help with APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Organizations</strong> - Organizations that can help individuals with API needs.</li>
<li><strong>Events</strong> - Meetups, conferences and other events to learn about APIs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The more we expose the average person to APIs, the more they will be able to absorb and understand. I've turned hundreds of average, non-technical folks on to the concept of APIs, and have seen them become evangelists and even API practitioners. Some move into API focused roles, but many are just are more successful in what they are already doing, from social media work to sending out their weekly newsletter.</p>
<p>I've always put API awareness for individuals into the same bucket as financial awareness. You shouldn't have an awareness of the inner workings of banking and credit industry, but you should have an awareness that you have accounts, who has access to them, and that you can move money around, and have different accounts for different purposes, with different providers--the same applies to the world of APIs.</p>
<p><strong>API Practioners ("Not Normals")</strong><br />When I first started writing this post, I had this section broken up into three groups: 1) Provider, 2) Service Provider, and 3) Analysts. Much of it ended up being redundant, so I'm going to share the complete list of what contributes to my API awareness, and depending on where you exist in the API spectrum (gonna have to use this one more), what matters to you will vary. </p>
<p>This is a master dump of my research, and the approach I have used to track on in the world of APIs since 2010--an analyst 100K view. However, API providers, service providers, evangelists, and analysts should possess a similar level of awareness--maybe not at the scope I pay attention to but employing some of the same tactics, applied to a smaller group of APIs either internally or externally. Here is what I'd consider a comprehensive definition of my API awareness stack.</p>

<p>API awareness spans many stops along the API lifecycle, and across a variety of the most common, and critical building blocks of what drives API ecosystems. Awareness doesn't come easy. It takes time, and have access to the right information, and signals, potentially across many different entities and domains--aggregating, filtering, and ranking is essential developing and strengthening your awareness. In the end, even with the same signals and information available, there will be many definitions of what is the necessary awareness.</p>
<p>I am glad I didn't break this into different buckets for different people. I think that is a dangerous thing for us to do. I think people should be curious and have agency the decisions regarding which signals should feed their awareness. How many APIs. Which APIs. Which companies, news, events, and other areas. Investment, patents, and other legal aspects. I don't think that all individual should be bombarded with the more complex inner workings of the API industry I pay attention to, but they should be able to make the decision to move beyond a basic level of understanding, and become an evangelist, or analyst--quantifying and developing the awareness they desire or need to achieve.</p>
<p>I'll stop there. This is a good first draft of what I consider API awareness. At the individual API level, across a collection or industry of APIs, and even at the analyst levels, potentially paying attention to many different APIs across a variety of different industries. Before I put this definition down, I am going to take it and apply it in two other ways: 1) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observability">Observability, "measure for how well internal states of a system can be inferred by knowledge of its external outputs"</a>, and 2) Rating, "establish a rating system that articulates where an API or provider exists on awareness and observability spectrum". We'll see where it goes. Thinking about this voodoo is helping me better organize some of the existing parts of my research, and hopefully help my friend out in his work as well. </p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Feb 2017</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/walled_garden_blue_gray_circuit.jpg" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p>It is a common tactic of older software companies to offer open source, services, and tools in a way that all roads just lead into their walled garden. There are many ways to push vendor lock-in and the big software vendors from 2000 through 2010 have mastered how to route you back to their walled gardens and make sure you stay there. Web APIs have set into motion a shift in how we architect our web, mobile, and device applications, as well as providing services to the life cycle that are behind the operation of these web APIs. While this change has the potential to positive it often it can be very difficult to tell apart the newer breed of software companies from the legacy version, amidst all the hype around technology and startups.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/02/14/api-lifemiddlewarecycle-api/">I've been having conversations recently which are pushing me to think more about middleware</a>, or what I'd refer to as API life cycle tooling. In my opinion, these are companies who are selling services and tools to the API life cycle, which in turn is fueling our web, mobile, device, and other applications. In my opinion, as a server provider, you should be selling to a company and API provider's life cycle needs, not your walled garden needs. I understand that you want all of a companies business, and you want to lock them into your platform, but that was how we did business 10 years ago.</p>
<p>The API service providers I'm shining a light on in 2017 are servicing one or <a href="http://apievangelist.com">many stops along the API life cycle</a>, supporting API definitions, and providing value without getting in the way, or locking customers in. They do this on-premise, or in the cloud of your choice, and allow you to seamless overlap many different API service providers providing a variety of solutions across the API life cycle. You will notice this patterns in the companies I partner with like <a href="http://apimatic.io">APIMATIC</a>, <a href="http://restlet.com/">Restlet</a>, <a href="http://apis.how/zflfesymzk">Tyk</a>, and <a href="http://apis.how/bgdteovduo">Dreamfactory</a>. I find I have a lot more patience when it comes to the whole startup thing if your service is plug and play and us API providers can choose where and when we want to put your tools and services to use.</p>
<p>I want my API service providers to behave just like they recommend to their customers--modular, flexible, agile, and providing a mix of valuable API resources I can use across my own API lifecycle. You'll find me doing more highlighting of what I consider to be API life cycle service providers who bring value to the API life cycle, with API definitions like the OpenAPI Spec as the center of their operations.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Feb 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://box-api-navigator.com/files?init=true"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2017_02_13_at_10.20.02_pm.png" alt="" width="50%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://box-api-navigator.com/files?init=true">The document platform Box updated their developer efforts recently</a>, helping push&nbsp;forward the definition of what API documentation can be. I've long been advocating moving APIs out from the shadow of the developer portal, and make it more seamless with any UI, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/10/24/the-api-behind-every-feature-in-the-user-interface/">kind of like CloudFlare does with their DNS dashboard</a>. There is no reason the API should have to be&nbsp;hidden from users--it should be right behind the UI for everyone to discover.</p>
<p>Box does this. You can interact with files just like it is the regular interface. When push the get the folder items, upload file, or other option available to you in the documentation--you get example API request and response in the right-hand column. It is a blend of a regular UI, and some of the attractive and interface documentation we've seen emerge lately like <a href="https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc">ReDoc</a>. Making it easy to see and understand what an API does, while speaking in the context of solving a relevant problem for a human.</p>
<p>API documentation doesn't have to be overly technical and boring. It can look like a regular user interface, and the API can be right behind the UI curtain, providing a snapshot of the requests and responses that are doing the heavy lifting behind. I'm finally seeing the movement I have wanted to see with API documentation in 2017. I'm feeling like this is going to be common theme with the world of APIs for all of us--we will never see things move as fast as we want, but eventually the world evolves, and we will see investment in the areas that make a difference on the ground at API operations, and for the consumers who are putting APIs to work in their regular world.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/02/14/api-lifemiddlewarecycle-api/">API Life(middleware)Cycle API</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">14 Feb 2017</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/bw_gear_life_cycle.png" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p>I have had a series of calls with an analyst group lately, discussing the overall API landscape in 2017. They have a lot of interesting questions about the space, and I enjoyed their level of curiosity and awareness around what is going on--it helps me think through this stuff, and (hopefully) better explain it to folks who aren't immersed in API like I am. </p>
<p>This particular group is coming at it from a middleware perspective and trying to understand what APIs have done to the middleware market, and what opportunities exist (if at all). This starting point for an API conversation got me thinking about the concept of middleware in contrast to, or in relationship to what I'm seeing emerge as the services and tooling for the API life cycle.</p>
<p>Honestly, when I jumped on this call I Googled the term middleware to provide me with a fresh definition. Middleware: software that acts as a bridge between an operating system or database and applications, especially on a network. What does that mean in the age of API? Did API replace this? There is middleware for deploying APIs from backend systems. There is middleware for brokering, proxying and providing a gateway for APIs. Making middleware as a term pretty irrelevant. I think middle traditionally meant a bridge between backend and the frontend, where web APIs make things omnidirectional--in the middle of many different directions and outcomes.</p>
<p>The answer to the question of what has API done to middleware is just "added dimensions to its surface area". Where is the opportunity? "All along the API lifecycle". Middleware (aka services & tooling) is popping up through the life cycle to help design, deploy, manage, test, monitor, integrate, and numerous other stops along the API life cycle. All the features of our grandfathers API gateway are now available as a microservices buffet, allowing us to weave middleware nuggets into any system to system integrations as well as other web, mobile, and device applications. </p>
<p>Middleware as a concept has been distilled down into its smallest possible unit of value, made available via an API, deployed in a virtualized environment of your choosing, on the web, on-premise, or on-device. This new approach to delivering services, and tooling is often still in the middle, but the word really doesn't do it justice anymore. I wanted to go through all the areas of my research and look for any signs of middleware or its ghost.</p>
<p>Some of the common areas of my research that I think fits pretty nicely with some earlier concepts of what middleware does or can do. I would say that <a href="http://database.apievangelist.com/">Database</a>, <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com/">Deployment</a>, <a href="http://virtualization.apievangelist.com/">Virtualization</a>, <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/">Management</a>, <a href="http://documentation.apievangelist.com/">Documentation</a>, <a href="http://change-log.apievangelist.com/">Change Log</a>, <a href="http://testing.apievangelist.com/">Testing</a>, <a href="http://performance.apievangelist.com/">Performance</a>, <a href="http://authentication.apievangelist.com/">Authentication</a>, <a href="http://encryption.apievangelist.com/">Encryption</a>, <a href="http://security.apievangelist.com/">Security</a>, <a href="http://command-line-interface.apievangelist.com/">Command Line Interface (CLI)</a>, <a href="http://logging.apievangelist.com/">Logging</a>, <a href="http://analysis.apievangelist.com/">Analysis</a>, and <a href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com/">Aggregation</a> are some pretty clear targets. Of course, this is just my view of what middleware was to me, from say 1995 through 2007--after that, everything began to shift because of APIs.</p>
<p>As web APIs evolve the reason you'd buy or sell a tool or service to be in the middle of some meaningful action when APIs started being about <a href="http://sdk.apievangelist.com/">Software Development Kit (SDK)</a>, <a href="http://embeddable.apievangelist.com/">Embeddable</a>, <a href="http://visualization.apievangelist.com/">Visualization</a>, <a href="http://webhooks.apievangelist.com/">Webhooks</a>, <a href="http://ipaas.apievangelist.com/">iPaaS</a>, <a href="http://orchestration.apievangelist.com/">Orchestration</a>, <a href="http://realtime.apievangelist.com/">Real Time</a>, <a href="http://voice.apievangelist.com/">Voice</a>, <a href="http://spreadsheets.apievangelist.com/">Spreadsheets</a>,<span> </span><a href="http://communication.apievangelist.com/">Communication</a>, <a href="http://support.apievangelist.com/">Support</a>, <a href="http://containers.apievangelist.com/">Containers</a>, <a href="http://serverless.apievangelist.com/">Serverless</a>,  and <a href="http://bots.apievangelist.com/">Bots</a>. This is where things really begain working in many different directions, making the term middle seem antiquated to me. You are now having to think beyond just any single application, and all your middleware is now very modular, API-driven, and can be plugged in anywhere along the life cycle not just any application, but also any API -- mind blown. </p>
<p>The schism in middleware for me began<a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/02/13/the-reasons-why-we-pull-back-the-curtain-on-technology/"> when companies started cracking open the SDK and were using HTTP to give access to important resources</a> like compute with storage with AWS, and SMS with Twilio, offering a peek behind the curtain for developers. Then further expanding to regular humans with embeddable tooling, iPaaS with services like Zapier, and other services and tools that anyone can implement, no coding necessary. All of this was fueled by mobile, and the need to break down the data, content, and algorithms for use in these mobile applications. Things have quickly gone from backend to frontend, to everywhere to everywhere. How do you get in the middle of that?</p>
<p>Anyways. I'm guessing this story might be a little incoherent. I'm just trying to find my words for future conversations on this topic. As the regular world is confronted with this API thing, they have a lot of questions, and they need help understanding how we got here. Honestly, I feel like I don't fully have a grasp on how we got here. So writing about it helps me to think through this stuff, and polish it a little bit for the next round of conversations.</p>

Part of this work I had left a note for myself about finding / creating an OpenAPI Spec for the Data.gov API, which since it is a CKAN implementation should be pretty easy--I hoped.</p>

More <a href="http://techblog.netflix.com/2017/02/introducing-hubcommander.html">companies like Netflix are using as part of their continuous integration workflow</a>, something&nbsp;that<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/10/05/evolving-the-api-sdk-with-apimatic-dx-kits/">&nbsp;API service providers like APIMATIC are looking to take advantage of with a new wave of services and tooling</a>. This usage of Github goes well beyond just managing code, and are making the platform more of an engine in any continuous&nbsp;integration and API life cycle workflow.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist">I run all my API research project sites on Github</a>. I do this because it is secure&nbsp;and static, as well as introduces a very potent way to not just manage a single website, but over 200 individual open data and API projects. Each one of my API research areas leverages a Github Jeykll core, providing a machine readable index of the companies, news, tools, and other building blocks I'm aggregating throughout my research.</p>
<p>Recently, this approach has moved beyond the core areas of my API research&nbsp;and is something I'm applying to my API discovery work, profiling the resources available with <a href="http://amazon.web.services.stack.network/">popular API platforms like Amazon Web Services</a>, and <a href="http://gsa.index.apievangelist.com/">across my government work like with my GSA index</a>. Each of these projects managed using Github, providing a machine readable index of the disparate APiI, in a single APIs.json index which includes OpenAPI Specs for each of the APIs included. When complete, these indexes can provide a runtime discovery engine of APIs&nbsp;used as part of integrations, providing an&nbsp;index of single APIs, as well as potentially across many distributed APiI brought together into a single meaningful collection.</p>
<p>I've started pushing this approach even further with <a href="http://adopta.agency">my Knight Foundation funded Adopta.Agency work</a>, and making the Github repository not just a machine-readable index of many APIs, I'm also using the _data folder as a JSON or YAML data store, which can then also be indexed as part of the APIs.json&nbsp;and OpenAPI Spec for each project. <a href="http://xml.son.yaml.jekyll.apievangelist.com/">I've been playing with different ways of storing and working with JSON and YAML in Jekyll on Github for a while now</a>, but now I'm <a href="http://jekyll.open.referral.adopta.agency/">trying to develop projects that are a seamless open data store, as well as an API index, providing the best of both worlds</a>.</p>
<p>This is not a model for delivering high performance and availability APIs. This is a model for publishing and sharing open data so that it is highly available, workable, and hosted on Github for FREE. Most of the data I work with is publicly available. It is part of what I believe in, and how I work on a regular basis. Making it available in a Github repo allows it to be forked, or even consumed directly while offloading bandwidth and storage costs to Github. The GET layer for all my open data project is all static, and dead simple to work with. Next, I'm working on a truly RESTfully augmented layer providing&nbsp;the POST, PUT, and DELETE, as well as more advanced search solutions.</p>
<p>I am using the Github API for this augmented layer. I am just playing with different ways to proxy it&nbsp;and deliver the best search results possible. The POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE layer for each Github repository data store in the _data folder is pretty straightforward. My goal is to offload as much of the payload to Github as possible, but then augment what it can't do when it comes to more advanced usage. I'm looking for each API index and data store can act as a forkable engine for a variety of stops along the API life cycle, as well as throughout the delivery of the web, mobile, and device-based applications we are building on top of them.</p>

<p>I was trying to explain to a business analyst this week the difference between SDK and API, which he said was often used interchangeably by people he worked with. In my opinion SDK and API can be the same thing, depending on how you see this layer of our web, mobile, and device connectivity. The Internet has been rapidly expanding this layer for some time now, and unless you are watching it really don't see any difference between API and SDK--it is just where the software connects everything.</p>
<p>For me, an SDK is where the data, content&nbsp;and algorithmic production behind the curtain is packaged up for you -- giving you a pre-defined&nbsp;look at what is possible, prepared for you with a specific language or platform in mind. Most of the hard work of understanding what is going on has been translated and crafted, providing you with a set of instructions of what you can do with this resource in your application--your integration is pretty rigidly defined, not much experimentation or hacking encouraged.</p>
<p>An API has many of the same characteristics as an SDK, but the curtain is pulled back on the production a little bit more. Not entirely, but you do get a little more of a look at how things work, what data and content are available, and algorithmic resources are accessible. You still get the view which a provider intends you to have, but there are&nbsp;fewer assumptions about what you'll do with the resources put on the interface, leaving you to do more of the heavy lifting with how these resources will get put to use.</p>
<p>Most of the early motivations behind choosing an open approach to web APIs over more closed and as proprietary SDK, pulling back the curtain on how we develop software, weren't entirely intentional. Companies like Flickr and Twitter weren't trying to make their mark on the politics of how we integrate software, they were busy and looking to encourage 3rd party developers to do the hard work of crafting the SDKs, and other platform integrations. The reasons for pulling back the curtain on how the sauce is made was purely about furthering their own needs, and not necessarily about moving the needle forward regarding how we talk about software integration--it was just business, enabled by tech (HTTP), and the politics came later, as a sort of side-effect.</p>
<p>Many traditional software developers&nbsp;and software-enabled hardware manufacturers have a hard time seeing this expansion in how we integrate with software&nbsp;and are usually still very SDK oriented, even if there are many APIs right behind their SDK curtain. They do this for a variety of technical, business, as well as political reason. It is my personal mission to help these folks understand a little more about this expansion in the software connectivity layer, and the benefits brought to the table by being more open. We need the client integration (SDK) and API to be loosely coupled from a technical, business, and political stance--to make things work in a web-enabled environment.</p>
<p>It isn't easy to help business folk see the importance of leaving this layer open. This is the damaging effects of the Oracle vs. Google Java Copyright, is it gums up and slows this expansion, something we need to encourage&nbsp;and keep open, even if the&nbsp;bigtechcos&nbsp;don't fully get it. We are going to need this momentum to not just keep the web, mobile, and device integration accessible and loosely coupled, but we will also need to help make sure the growing number of algorithms that are impacting our worlds <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observability">are more observable as well</a>. Providers aren't going to be willing to pull back the curtain on the smoke and mirrors that are&nbsp;AI, machine learning, and other algorithmic varietals infecting our lives.</p>
<p>There are many reasons why we pull back (or don't) the curtain on technology, at the application, SDK, API, or&nbsp;algorithmic levels. I don't count on companies, institutions, and government agencies to ever do this for the right reasons. I'm counting on them doing it for all the wrong reasons. I am looking at incentivizing their competitors to do it, helping influence policy or law to direct the systems to behave in a certain way, and encourage companies to be lazy, and keep the curtain pulled back because it's easier. Getting a peek behind the curtain, or convincing some to pull it back is never a straightforward conversation--you often have to use many of the same tactics and voodoo employed by tech providers to get what you want.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/02/01/amazon-dash-ok-idea-dumb-implementations/">I have been kvetching about the quality of embeddable tooling out there</a>, so I'm working on&nbsp;discovering anything interesting. I started with bookmarklets, which I think is one of the most underutilized, and simplest examples of working with APIs on the web. Here are a couple of interesting bookmarklets for APIs out there:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://dev.twitter.com/web/bookmarklet">Twitter</a></strong> - Probably the most iconic API and bookmarklet out there -- share to Twitter.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://pinboard.in/howto/">Pinboard</a></strong> - An API-driven bookmarklet for saving bookmarks that I use every day.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://jonudell.net/h/">Hypothesis</a></strong> - A whole suite of API-driven bookmarklets for annotating the web.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/bookmarklet.html">Socrata</a></strong> - A pretty cool bookmarklet for quickly viewing documentation on datasets.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://tincanapi.com/bookmarklet/">Tin Can API</a></strong> - A bookmarklet for recording self-directed learning experiences.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you search for API bookmarklets you don't get much. Nothing stands out as being innovative. I will keep looking when I have time, and I'll keep curating and understanding any new approaches, and examples, and tooling when possible.</p>
<p>Ultimately it just confounds me, because a simple JS bookmarklet triggering one or more API interactions is a no brainer. We have examples of this in action, making an impact on login, sharing, annotation, and more, so why don't we have more examples? IDK. It is something I'll explore as I push forward my embeddable API research.</p>
<p>Maybe I'm just missing something...</p>

<p>I spend a lot of time looking for logos of the companies that I write about. A lack of consistency around how companies manage (or don't) their logos, and make them available (or don't) regularly frustrates the hell out of me. While doing my regular work I found myself Googling for the Schema.org logl -- what came up made me smile.</p>
<p>When you Google for Schema.org logo you don't get the logo for Schema.org, <a href="https://schema.org/logo">you get the schema for a logo</a>, which is the image property of a thing&nbsp;and is used by brands, organizations, places, products, and services. I still had to actually do a separate search to find the Schema.org logo, but it did make me smile, and make me think even deeper about how we manage (or don't) our bits online.</p>
<p><a href="http://schema.org/">Schema.org is so important</a>. It keeps popping up on my radar, and I'm seeing more examples of it being used as part of JSON-LD API and web search implementations. As I work on my <a href="http://openreferral.org/">human services data specification&nbsp;(HSDS)</a> project I'm going to carve off time to weave JSON-LD and Schema.org into my storytelling. I can't just show people Schema.org and expect them to understand the importance, I'm going to have to show them with meaningful examples of it working out in the wild.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/01/09/service-level-agreements-for-researchers-who-depend-on-apis/">I wrote about the need for service level agreements dedicated to researchers who are depending on APIs a couple weeks ago</a>, and while I was doing <a href="http://amazon.web.services.stack.network/">my work profiling of AWS</a>, I came across their approach to supporting research. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/government-education/research-and-technical-computing/">Amazon has a dedicated program research and technical computing on AWS</a>, where they:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"helps researchers process complex workloads by providing the cost-effective, scalable and secure compute, storage and database capabilities needed to accelerate time-to-science. With AWS, scientists can quickly analyze massive data pipelines, store petabytes of data and share their results with collaborators around the world, focusing on science not servers."</em></p>
<p>Amazon has three distinct ways in which they are helping researchers, as well as the industries and people they impact:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/government-education/research-and-technical-computing/research-cloud-program/">AWS Research Cloud Program</a></strong> - The AWS Research Cloud Program helps you focus on science, not servers---all with minimal effort and confidence that your data and budget are safe in the AWS Cloud. Government and education-based researchers are eligible to receive program benefits. Apply to join the program, in order to access the AWS Research Cloud Handbook and other cloud resources built for researchers, by researchers.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/government-education/research-and-technical-computing/nsf-aribd/">AWS Research Initiative</a></strong> - The AWS Research Initiative (ARI) brings Amazon Web Services (AWS) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) together, with AWS providing AWS Cloud Services through provision of AWS Promotional Credits, awarded to NSF grant applicants to leverage Critical Techniques, Technologies and Methodologies for Advancing Foundations and Applications of Big Data Sciences and Engineering (BIGDATA).</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/government-education/open-data/">Open Data</a></strong> - Organizations around the globe are increasingly making their data open and available for the public to discover, access, and use. This is fueling entrepreneurship, accelerating scientific discovery, and creating efficiencies across many industries. Amazon Web Services provides a comprehensive tool kit for sharing and analyzing data at any scale.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Amazon helps researchers by providing them with cloud resources for doing their research, assisting them with the budget of it all, while also opening you up to other grant opportunities, as well as can provide you with a place to publish and share your open data, and put data from other researchers to work in your research. It sounds like a pretty fine start to a more formal API researcher &nbsp;blueprint that other API providers can consider as part of their own operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that I have a base definition crafted (thanks, AWS!). I'll spend time looking for other implementations in the wild. Once I have a strong enough blueprint crafted, I want to start lobbying Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and other leading social data platforms to consider. The data on these platforms&nbsp;provides an important look at the world around us, one that researchers should have access to, without costs, rate limits, or other obstacles in their way. Amazon's motivations in offering this type of package are clear--they want researchers to become customers. When it comes to other providers, I'm going to have to experiment with other incentive models--I am guessing they won't always be happy to get on board.</p>
<p>I will keep polishing the building blocks of my API research program as I find other examples of this. Once I have it refined a little more I will publish as one of my industry guides. Providing a basic blueprint that any company can follow when setting up their own API program for research, but also make it something any individual looking to lobby for this kind of change can use as well. Amidst all the capitalist frenzy within the tech bubbles, it isn't always easy to convince folks of the importance of this type of access--especially when it costs them money.</p>

API management always resembled its older cousin the API gateway for me, so <a href="http://apis.how/ake3nxbapm">when companies like 3Scale</a> started offering a freemium model, that I could deploy in the cloud&nbsp;with a couple lines of code---I jumped on the API management bandwagon. It was easy&nbsp;and gave you all the service composition, onboarding, analytics, and metering tools you needed out of the box.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/06/11/where-is-the-open-source-api-platform/">I have been pushing on providers to provide an open source API management solution for quite some time</a>, and providers like <a href="http://wso2.com">WSO2</a> finally stepped up to bring an enterprise-grade solution to the table, then solutions like <a href="https://apiumbrella.io/">API Umbrella</a> also emerged for the government. Now in 2017, we have several open source solutions available to us, which makes me happy, but what I really like is how modular, versatile, and API-driven they are. I'm spending time learning more about my partner's solutions, and today <a href="http://apis.how/zflfesymzk">I'm working my way through what is possible with Tyk</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://tyk.io">Tyk is what API management should be</a>. It has all the user and organization management and assists you with the onboarding, authentication, service composition, rate limiting, and analytics that are core to any API management solution. However, what is really powerful for me is that you can deploy Tyk anywhere in the cloud, on-premise, on-device, and all of its features are API-driven, and interconnected because of it's APIs, webhooks, and other orchestration features. APIs aren't just about deploying a web API on a server, and making it available through a single base URL--they are everywhere, and our management tools need to reflect this.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/tyk_variants_1200px.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>We don't just have a single API stack anymore and we use a handful of 3rd party APIs. We are weaving together many different internal and partner stacks, as well a mess of 3rd party solutions. Tyk is your simple API management on a device, in your data center, or in the cloud. Tyk is also part of your API stack--the API management layer portion. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/28/the-lack-of-an-api-and-healthy-partner-integrations-is-an-early-warning-system-for-service-providers/">I am constantly pushing on API providers to practice what they preach and make everything they do API first</a>--Tyk is that. All the resources for the applications you build should be APIs, and all the infrastructure you use to design, deploy, manage, and orchestrate those APIs should be APIs--if you are a service provider in the space without an API, you will not be competitive.</p>
<p>Anyways, full disclosure and all -- Tyk is my partner. I'm writing about them because they give me money. However, I am not in the business of taking money to write about products that don't offer a real solution. All four of the logos you see on the left hand of my site are companies with products that I believe in, otherwise, I wouldn't take money from them. Tyk's approach to API management&nbsp;represents where I think things should be. Open source. Modular. Composable. And, you pay for complexity and scale. API management being commoditized&nbsp;is a win for everyone in my opinion, but it's been a long road to get here, with a lot of casualties along the way. ;-)</p>

<p>It was an interesting journey getting the API specification formerly known as Swagger into the Linux foundation last year. After SmartBear donated the spec to the newly formed <a href="http://openapis.org">Open API Initiative</a>, I was considering joining the governing body behind the spec, but with all I had going on last year, I didn't feel it was the right time. Participating in governance groups hasn't really ever been my thing, and there are a handful of large organizations involved, and who am I really? I'm just a single person ranting about APIs. However, in 2017 I am changing my tune and will be joining the Open API Initiative (OAI)</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/01/19/focusing-on-common-api-definitions-schema-scopes-and-specifications/">It is an important time for API definitions</a>, and there is <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/01/25/what-is-at-stake-with-api-definitions-at-the-moment/">a lot riding on the success of OpenAPI, as well as API definitions in general</a>. I feel like we need as many voices at the table as we possibly can. We need government agencies, enterprise, small businesses, startups, and individual analysts like myself. I feel pretty strongly that API definitions should be openly licensed, accessible, and following the most commonly used patterns available to us across the API sector. We don't need to all be speaking a different language when it comes to deploying compute resources or working with images, and API definitions are how we get there.</p>
<p>After a ramping up period, I will work with OAI on their marketing strategy, helping tell stories, and learn about interesting implementations and use cases when possible--dovetailing nicely with what I am already doing. I'll be tuned into the conversation about the spec, but will definitely be standing off to the side as an observer for quite some time. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/01/25/the-openapi-specification-version-30-highlights/">I'm pretty stoked with what they've done with version 3.0 of the spec</a>, and at this point, I have a lot to learn before I open up my mouth and chime in on anything. I'm just enjoying watching the personalities play out in the Slack room--this stuff should be a reality TV show, but that is another story.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It makes me happy to be part of the Open API Initiative (OAI). As I work on my regular API Evangelist research, and move forward projects like <a href="https://openreferral.org/">Open Referral,</a> and their Human Services Data Specification (HSDS), the OpenAPI Specification is critical to everything I am doing. The OAI is extremley important right now, and I'm pleased to have a seat at the table of such an important organization, and learning from the other smart folks moving the specification forward. 2017 will be an interesting year for not just the OpenAPI Spec, but for all the services and topen tooling that is being built on the spec, as well as the wide range of industries being touch by APIs, and putting common API specifications, and schema to work.</p>

<p class="p1">I was a regular check-in&nbsp;with one of my favorite API service providers this week, talking about some of the new features they are rolling out in coming weeks, and they demonstrated for me why API definitions are so important in 2017. &nbsp;<a href="http://apimatic.io">APIMATIC</a> got their start deploying SDKs for your API, but have quickly moved into providing API documentation, testing, continuous integration, and some additional stops that they have planned for release in coming months.</p>
<p class="p1">As I was sharing how happy I was with their movement into new areas of the API life cycle, and praising their agility&nbsp;when it came to rolling out new features, they responded with:</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"The credit goes to machine-readable descriptions. Once you have them then there are endless possibilities. Thanks for motivating us to support all the description formats in first place :-)"</em></p>
<p class="p1">This is why being fluent in API definitions is so important to operating your API, or in APIMATIC's case, operating as an API service provider. There are an increasing number of API providers who support the importing and exporting of API definitions, but nobody has gone full API definition as APIMATIC as. They didn't just center their SDK, documentation, testing and continuous integration solutions around API definitions, they <a href="https://apimatic.io/transformer">exposed their API definition translation engine as a service called API Transformer</a>, allowing anyone else to follow their lead.</p>
<p class="p1">When people first learn about API definitions, the 101 lessons usually center around API documentation, and maybe secondarily the generation of the server or client-side&nbsp;SDKs. However API definitions are rapidly being used for every other stop along the life cycle from design to deprecation, as well as the unknown future stops along the way that only&nbsp;become possible because all your API resources are well defined, and machine-readable. It is this agility and flexibility that I want to incentivize, helping companies be as effective as APIMATIC has been when it comes to delivering new API-driven solutions.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Feb 2017</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2017_02_08_at_8.18.41_am.png" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/01/03/exploring-the-economics-of-wholesale-and-retail-algorithmic-apis/">I recently wrote about how Algorithmia offloads the compute costs around machine learning using AWS</a>, structuring their image style transfer modeling so that the consumer pays the cost for deploy an AWS GPU instance. It is an interesting way to shift the burden of paying for the hard costs around API operations.</p>
<p>Another interesting approach I extracted from a story I wrote yesterday is from <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/government-education/open-data/">Amazon Web Services (AWS) with their approach to open data</a>. Amazon Public Datasets are available as <span>Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) snapshots and/or Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets. AWS hosts the master copy of the dataset, and when you want to use, you fire it up in your AWS account, and get to work.</span></p>
<p><span>I find some of these approaches to managing, and offloading the heavy costs of working with algorithms, datasets, and other resources interesting. I especially find this approach interesting because it is in the service of public data, providing an option for how the private sector can help share the load in managing government, research, and other public data, and offloading the heavy costs to those who are going to put the data to use. </span></p>
<p>I will figure out how to add this into my API <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/">monetization</a> and <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">plan</a> research. Providing a list of these types of approaches to providing on-premise, wholesale, and containerized or virtualized approaches to making data, content, and algorithms available. I will definitely keep looking for unique approaches to API deployment like this--after a couple of these grabbing my attention, I'm feeling like I am seeing another shift in both the technology and business of how we deploy and consume APIs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Feb 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://zapier.com/blog/push-by-zapier-google-chrome-extension/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/push_by_zapier_icon_button.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I would say that <a href="http://embeddable.apievangelist.com">embeddable tooling</a> is one of saddest areas of the API space for me in recent years. When it comes to buttons, badges, widgets, and other embeddable goodies that put APIs work, the innovation has been extremely underwhelming. Login, like, share, and a handful of other embeddable tooling have taken hold, but there really isn't any sort of sophisticated approach to putting APIs to work using web, mobile, browser embeddables.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/10/11/ipaas-in-your-browser-with-push-by-zapier/">The only innovation I can think of recently is from Zapier with their Push by Zapier solution</a> -- allowing you to orchestrate with the zaps you've&nbsp;creative, putting APIs to work using the variety of recipes they've cooked up. I'm thinking that I will have to step up my storytelling around what is possible with Push by Zapier, helping folks understand the possibilities. Push by Zapier is a Google Chrome extension, making it more browser than embeddable, but the approach transcends embeddable, browser, and even into the conversation (bot, voice, etc.) for me.</p>
<p>It's all about getting users frictionless access to API driven actions. Whether you are building Zapier pushes, Alexa Skills, or a Slackbot, you need to trigger, and daisy chain together API driven requests and responses ending in the desired location. I'm just looking for dead simple ways of doing all of this&nbsp;in my browser, embedded on web pages, and anywhere I desire. I'm just looking for a way to embed, link, and display the doorway to meaningful actions that anyone can implement, from wherever they want--where the action takes place is up to the API provider.</p>
<p>I want a vocabulary of simple and complex embeddables,&nbsp;either just HTML, some JS, and maybe a little CSS magic to round off. When I explain to someone in a Tweet or email explaining that they can publish a news article to a Google spreadsheet, I want my sentence to accomplish what I'm trying to articulate. I want to be able to speak in API--I want to be able to develop an IT operational outline&nbsp;and make it executable using <a href="http://amazon.web.services.stack.network/">the wealth of API resources available to me over at AWS</a>. I want to be able to craft meaningful tasks, and easily share with others, replicated it for them, in their environment, using their credentials, without confusing the hell out of them.</p>
<p>Anyways, I am just ranting of this collision of these worlds as I am seeing unfold. I suspect the lack of innovation around embeddables&nbsp;is more about proprietary stances on APIs, and a platformification of things--meaning folks are investing in speaking in these ways via their channel, on their platforms, not an open web approach for everyone. I think Zapier has the strong lead in this area, with Slack, and Alexa trailing behind. The problem is that all the players are just to focused on their ow implementations, and not a wider web edition of their conversational interfaces. I'll rant in a future post about how this politics of API operations&nbsp;and closed views on API IP are stunting the growth in meaningful communication using API resources. &nbsp;</p>
