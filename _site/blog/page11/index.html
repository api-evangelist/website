        <span class="post-date">07 Feb 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/beachclouds_clean_view.jpg" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>The "cloud" has done some very interesting things for individuals, companies, organizations, institutions, and government&nbsp;agencies, and is something that shouldn't be ignored. However, I watch organizations of all shapes and sizes make a similar mistake when it comes to outsourcing too much of their operations to vendors, and cloud services. Each organization's needs will be different, but technology leaders should be mindful of how they invest in talent, alongside how much they invest in external services.</p>
<p>I struggle with this in my own business on a daily basis, but I've also seen small businesses make the same mistake, as well as witnessed the damage of this all the way up the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in the federal government. The VA has outsourced it's technological soul to vendors, leaving the ability to make sound architectural choices to those who control the puppet strings outside of the agency. I'm seeing a lot of smaller organizations doing this same thing, but with cloud services (outsource 2.0), instead of the traditional software vendor (outsource 1.0)--outsourcing their technological soul to the cloud.</p>
<p>Outsourcing capacity is something I struggle with constantly. There is only so much I can do as a one-person shop, but there is also a limit on what I can spend on services in the cloud, creating a naturally occurring balancing effect. In addition to this natural effect, I am also constantly evaluating what I should be learning myself, and investing in my own internal capacity, as opposed to outsourcing it. I have to be extra careful regarding who I depend on because if service changes, is shut down, or maybe prices me out of range -- it could be pretty damaging to my operations. I am hyper aware of this vicious&nbsp;cycle when it comes to my dependence on the cloud or any single service.</p>
<p>I was just having a conversation around the hard decisions that a school district was having to make in this area. They have to make the big contract purchase, hire the talent&nbsp;or invest in talent locally. These are tough decisions to make, but in the end I always lean towards investment in on-premise capacity, working to be as critical as possible when it comes to adopting cloud services, and investing in only external expertise -- while there is no perfect answer, and investing in internal capacity might be costly, but this will help get you through hard times, that depending on the cloud services will not.</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Feb 2017</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/carryload_diego_rivera1.jpg" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p>I am finally getting back to <a href="http://adopta.agency">my Knight Foundation funded grant work on Adopta Agency</a>, I'm investing some research cycles into finding some tools that civic, science, journalism and other public data activists can put to use in their critical work. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/12/13/scientists-are-frantically-copying-u-s-climate-data-fearing-it-might-vanish-under-trump/">We've seen folks rise to the occasion when it came to climate data, helping migrate vital resources from federal government servers</a>, something I'd like to see happen across other business sectors, as well as continue as an ongoing thing throughout this administration, and beyond.</p>
<p>I have long been a proponent of the private sector sharing the load when it comes to managing public data and APIs. After leaving DC during the 2013 federal government shutdown I began evangelizing the importance of individuals and companies stepping up to help with the heavy lifting of making sure public data is available when we need it most--resulting in my Adopta.Agency work.  I feel pretty strongly that the federal government has an important role to play in this conversation, but I also feel that the private sector needs to step up and help--additionally, I also feel that is important that individuals step up and be present in the discussion.</p>
<p>Github plays a central role in my Adopta.Agency work. Any government data I turn into an API lives on Github as JSON, CSV, or other machine-readable format--taking advantage fo the Github platform for managing, as well as helping me eliminate or completely reduce the costs of managing public data. I spend money each month on hosting my public data work (it's my addiction), but I couldn't do it without a place to park it and offset storage and bandwidth costs. With this in mind, I'm spending time trying to find other services that public data and API folks can put to work for them, either eliminating or reducing the cost of managing open public data on the web.</p>
<p>My Adopta.Agency toolkit starts with Github and extends to <a href="https://github.com/adopta-agency/adopta-blueprint">the open source blueprint for adopting government data</a> (which lives on Github) - now I want to add some additional resources that folks can consider. First on my list is <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/government-education/open-data/">AWS Open Data</a>, where organizations can publish their open data sets, and consumers can deploy datasets for use in their own AWS infrastructure--smart. Next up is <a href="https://www.google.com/publicdata/admin">Google Public Datasets</a>, where you can browse existing datasets and add your own. That is my list so far. I'm spending some time looking for other services that users can use for free or extremely low costs as part of their public data work, and need your help.</p>
<p>If you know of any other services that users can use let me know. I'm not just looking for storage solutions. Ideally, it would be a full stack services that public data advocates could use to acquire, store, management, and deploy public data as an API--additionally, any services that would help them throughout throught the API life cycle. I'm looking for a more formal and established approach, specifically something with a URL, logo, description and landing page that I can add to my Adopta.Agency Toolbox. If you have any questions let me know, you can leave <a href="https://github.com/adopta-agency/master/issues">any thoughts, issues, or suggestions to the Adopta.Agency Github issues</a>.</p>

<p>Telling the story of what your&nbsp; API accomplishes may seem like a pretty simple, straightforward thing, but you'd be surprised how many API providers DO NOT do this on a regular basis, or do not have dedicated stories, showcase, or similar section to their website. This is why I beat this drum on a regular basis -- if you do not tell the story of the cool things people are doing with your API or your API services, they will never know how your solution works, and will probably never think of your service again--even with they actually have that specific problem that you solve.</p>
<p>To help demonstrate this in a very meta way, I am going to showcase how my clients, showcase their clients. Deep man. Next up is my partner DreamFactory, <a href="https://www.dreamfactory.com/stories">providing six very compelling stories about how their API deployment and management platform is being put to use</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.dreamfactory.com/stories/techego">TECHeGO</a></strong> - DreamFactory is at the core of TECHeGO's powerful ERP platform&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.dreamfactory.com/stories/verizon">Verizon Cloud</a></strong> - Discover how DreamFactory gave Verizon Cloud a turnkey developer portal.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.dreamfactory.com/stories/intel">Intel</a></strong> - Learn how Intel uses DreamFactory to expose legacy SQL data as a powerful REST API for AngularJS.</li>

</ul>
<p>Honestly, this type of blog posts makes for easy content for me, and obviously, it makes my partner DreamFactory happy, but more importantly, it is yet ANOTHER reminder for you to tell the story of the people who are using your APIs and services. Telling stories is essential to you obtaining new customers, but it is also essential for analysts like me to understand the real things being done with your APIs, allowing us to cut through the hype of the tech space.</p>
<p>Take another look at your API storytelling apparatus. Do you have an engineering blog or a blog dedicated to your API? Do you have stories, testimonials, customer showcase, or other dedicated areas for telling stories about your customers? Do you actively share these stories via your company's social channels like Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and more? Just a few of the questions you should be asking.</p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Feb 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2017_02_05_at_1.14.24_pm.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I'm putting some thought into the what a public analytics layer might look like for federal, state, county, and city governments. Something that looks like <a href="https://analytics.usa.gov/">analytics.usa.gov</a>, but for APIs. This is one of the things I really like about government is that you get to push forward ideas that you just can't convince folks to do in the private sector. There is no way companies will share their web or API traffic numbers publicly because there are too much smoke and mirrors involved in the process--for some reasons folks like accountability in government, but not in private sector???</p>
<p><a href="http://analysis.apievangelist.com/">API analytics</a> are a slightly different beast than web analytics, so I wanted to step back and think about what is important to me, an API consumer, or potential API consumer when I am looking at what API does, or a group of APIs actually&nbsp;do:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>APIs</strong> - Depending on how APIs are grouped, if there are many APIs across the different organization, groups, or event external agencies, help me understand which APIs are available, giving me a quick snapshot of which are most used, and how they compare against each other.</li>
<li><strong>Paths</strong> - Within each API, which individual API paths are the most used, showing me the most used aspects of any available API. Not always a sign of popularity, as the API design may be a factor here, but it will help me see how others are using.</li>
<li><strong>Applications</strong> - Which applications&nbsp;are making the most use of an API. This may be a number of calls or the number of APIs they are putting to use as well. Are these applications web, mobile, analysis, visualization, a system to system integration, or something else--details about what the app accomplishes and delivers helps a lot.</li>
<li><strong>Industries</strong> - Which industries are applications that put an API to work servicing? Would be helpful to understand which industries are finding API resources useful, and actually getting traction.</li>
<li><strong>Users</strong> - I am going to add users here, but I think we need to be careful here. I'd like to see trends and spikes in new user signups, but if these aren't translating into active applications, there really isn't much value. I also have privacy concerns, but I'm sure providers will think deeply about this.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a potential API consumer seeing this data would help me understand what is possible, based upon what other people are already doing, and possibly light the fire under my imagination. This is where I would start based upon some of the most common analytics I'm seeing behind the scenes from API providers. I wish ALL API providers had the balls to publish their analytics publicly, but sadly many are too concerned with obfuscating their successes and failures, to be this honest.</p>
<p>I'm hopeful with the precedent that analytics.usa.gov is setting with web analytics, and the fact that <a href="https://github.com/GSA/analytics.usa.gov">the code behind it is open source on Github</a> for any federal, state, county, or city government to put to work. I'm also optimistic about this same practice being put to use when it comes to the API layer of the public sector, and something I'm hoping that open source API management providers will help incentivize their users to publish on GitHub. I'd love for a few honest and brave API providers in the private sector to follow the lead, but after getting to know the space so intimately I am not holding my breath.</p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Feb 2017</span>
        <p>I hate how technology dehumanizes things and went you bundle that with the current model for how things get funded, it tends to do this at scale, and with troubling efficiency. I'm the API Evangelist. I am not selling APIs as a technology solution, I am fighting to keep this sliver of our increasingly technical worlds open, and serving humans--otherwise I feel there is no hope for any of this to work with any kind of equity and compassion for the people it should be serving.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I blog is to help me refine the stories I tell in the API space, both virtually and in person. In an effort to make the API acronym more accessible to the masses, and also a reminder to the technorati that all of this is about doing meaningful things for the tech sector, I'm continuing to push my definition of API on the world. So, what does API stand for? Application Programming Interface. Historically application meant the&nbsp;web, and then in 2010 that started shifting to be more&nbsp;about mobile, and now it's being dominated by discussion about connecting other devices to the web, aka Internet of Things.</p>
<p>When I hear the word&nbsp;application, I think of the more non-technical definition of it: the action of putting something in operation. While this definition isn't perfect, it is better than simply thinking about web, mobile, and devices. It moves us closer to actually doing something useful, meaningful, functional, and actually serving humans. Sure, that operation could be in the service of systems and mechanisms that exploit and hurt people, but I feel like it gets us closer to having a conversation about why something is in operation, and not just simply about tech for tech's sake.</p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Feb 2017</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/swingingbridge_blue_circuit.jpg" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/01/25/what-is-at-stake-with-api-definitions-at-the-moment/#comment-3128000440">I wrote about what is at stake with API definitions currently and someone made a thoughtful comment on the importance of continuing to discuss hypermedia amidst all of this</a>--I agree. I've long been an advocate for OpenAPI Spec and API Bueprint as a bridge from where we are, to where we need to be, getting us closer to the world hypermedia folks think we should have. I'd love it if every API allowed for content negotiation using one of the major hypermedia formats like HAL, Collection+JSON, or JSON-LD, but unfortunately, we have a lot of education and training ahead of us before we'll get there.</p>
<p>A combination of APIs.json for discovery, and OpenAPI Spec for defining the request and response structure of an API can seem clunky compared to the elegant (hopefully) design of a hypermedia API, but not every API architect has the know-how, or the time and resources to always do things properly. This doesn't mean that we shouldn't strive for a better future, but it just isn't always a reality on the ground, and as easy to achieve as many hypermedia believers might envision.</p>
<p>As the momentum picks up with API specification formats like OpenAPI, as well as the services and tooling popping up in the ecosystem we must have to keep an eye out for opportunities to make sure the bridge continues being extended to accommodate linking, relationships, and the other benefits hypermedia design patterns bring to the table. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/01/25/the-openapi-specification-version-30-highlights/">OpenAPI Spec 3.0 gives a slight nod towards what I'm talking about with the ability to add some basic linking</a>--it falls short of true hypermedia flows, but it is one more step on the bridge I'm talking about.</p>
<p>Technology has this amazing effect on us, that we either get too caught up in the future and forget the past, or even ignore the present, but I feel like OpenAPI Spec and other definitions are having the opposite effect where we forget the future, as well as the past in favor of the present, and what is going on now. I'm a fan of making sure we address the world we have, but I'm also going to be working to pull my head up and keep thinking about how we keep weaving in the benefits of hypermedia into the definitions, and tooling we are developing to meet the current demands of the API space.</p>
<p>I know that many folks feel that APIs do not need documentation and some of the other common tooling being developed on top of OpenAPI Specs, but think we underestimate peoples ability to grasp what an API does, and their ability to go from discovery to integration. I am playing with different ways to think about interactive documentation using OpenAPI Spec, and some of these docs apply to APIs that have multiple media types available, including some Siren editions--I am going to take a look at what possibilities there are for bridging this current divide, especially as I'm playing with OpenAPI Spec 2.0 some more.</p>

<p>I've spent a lot of time thinking about the Amazon Web Services ecosystem lately. <a href="http://amazon.web.services.stack.network/">I've gone through and generated OpenAPI Specs for the majority of their APIs, as well as an APIs.json&nbsp;index for the collection of valuable services</a>. I have also written about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/01/05/what-i-learned-crafting-api-definitions-for-66-of-the-amazon-web-services/">the relationship between the Amazon API and CLI</a>, and while doing this research I had jotted&nbsp;down thoughts about their approach to the Amazon Console.</p>
<p>For most API providers the API is a secondary thing, implemented after their website, applications, and even mobile applications in many situations. When AWS launched in 2006 they were only API and CLI, and after a couple of years, they got to work on providing their AWS Console, which plays a pretty significant role in working with the platform. The AWS console is pretty utilitarian, and lacking in a lot of UI / UX polish, but it plays an important role in working with the platform&nbsp;and is generally in sync with what features are available via the API and CLI.</p>
<p>I don't think there are any major lessons here, I just think it is interesting what has unfolded at Amazon, compared to how many other companies invest so much in the SaaS, and user interface portions of their operations, where AWS has definitely focused more heavily on the CLI and API, with the console only recently coming into focus. I do not think there is any 100% right way to do this, but I think making sure there are parity and consistency between what is available via a UI, and the API and CLI are important.</p>
<p>AWS doesn't always accomplish keeping all of this in sync, but you can see they work hard at it. Most times the CLI and API docs are side by side and even interlinked, and with some of the services, they provide you with a link in the developer area to the AWS Console portion for a specific service. I think whichever comes first for your company, the most important part of this is that you are constantly stepping back, and thinking of the relationship between your human interfaces and your programmatic interfaces, and considering where the gaps are, and how you can better weave all of your offerings together into a more coherent solution.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Feb 2017</span>
        <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-conversation-bubbles.png" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/01/19/focusing-on-common-api-definitions-schema-scopes-and-specifications/">I am focusing heavily on schema, definitions, and scopes in 2017</a>, because it is the most important layer in the tech sector, the API space, and is something that touches almost every industry, while also reaching into our personal worlds. I'm working on refining my argument in 2017 that I'm not selling APIs as a solution all by themselves, I'm pushing APIs to help us tame this insane beast that we've let out of the closet, and will never be able to put back in.</p>
<p><strong>Schema</strong><br />Whether it is JSON schema, MSON or Data Packages, current approaches to defining the data used as part of each API request or response are defining what has become to be known as the API economy (for good and bad). The schema describes the digital bits that are being created and moved around online today. They are the videos, images, blog posts, messages, and other digital elements that make up our online business and personal worlds. </p>
<p>Defining schema are critical to platforms working properly, and having them in a machine readable way allows for them to be shared between platforms, providers, and applications. Defining these bits allows us to have a conversation about these bits, which can also open up the conversation about whether or not we should be collecting, storing, and sharing these bits in the first place. I know many tech people don't want to have these conversations outside their inner circles, but we should--it is important for all of this to work for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Definitions</strong><br />API specification formats like OpenAPI Spec and API Blueprint have emerged to give us a way to define the surface area of APIs that are used across web, mobile, and device applications. These specification formats are allowing us to define, describe, and have a conversation around the valuable data, content, and algorithmic resources being made available via APIs using the web. The resulting API definitions are currently being used by companies as part of every stop along the application and API lifecycle, from design to deprecation.</p>
<p>API definitions allow us to describe the access available with the data, content, and algorithmic resources that we are depending on in our daily business and personal worlds. API definitions describe the request and response model for each API resource but also describes whether it is just readable, writeable, as well as updated, and able to be deleted. These definitions are being used to quantify what access is available in almost every aspect of our increasingly digital lives.</p>
<p><strong>Scopes </strong><br />"OAuth is an open standard for authorization, commonly used as a way for Internet users to authorize websites or applications to access their information on other websites but without giving them the passwords." OAuth scopes are the negotiated definition between each platform provider, end-users whose data that is being made available, and the 3rd party developer, application, and systems that will be putting the content, and data to work. In 2017, platforms like Slack are getting better at sharing their OAuth scopes in the same way that schema and definitions are being shared, making them an important part of the conversation.</p>
<p>I have sat with the Department of Energy and power companies, Health & Human Services and healthcare software manufacturers, negotiating the OAuth scopes for energy and healthcare data. The most familiar examples of this in action is when it comes to access your Facebook or Twitter social data, but it is a model that works across any content, data, and algorithms being made available on the web, in a secure way. OAuth scopes determine the 3-way relationship between providers, developers, and end-users, and make the process of sharing more secure, while also making sure all participating parties have a voice in the conversations, potentially at a granular level.</p>
<p><strong>Schema, Definitions, and Scopes</strong><br />I do not evangelize APIs because the technology fixes things. I do not believe in techno-solutionism. Internet technology is here, and we have to deal with it. My objectives around APIs is to make things more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observability">observable</a>, and I feel that schema gives us the opportunity to define what bits are being collected, stored, and moved around the web. API definitions give us the opportunity define what access there is to these bits, and where you GET this access, and when the opportunities for reading and writing are as well. Finally, scopes allow us to define exactly who has access to these bits, and most importantly, we are doing it in a way that gives the owners of the bits (end-users) a voice in the conversation.</p>
<p>This is why I'm focusing on the schema, definitions, and scope so heavily. They alone aren't a solution by themselves, but when you properly define, share, and them up to all stakeholders involved, the potential for equity is greater. The problem is that platforms do not always want to share, as the resources being made available are key to their revenue generation, and developers often see these bits in a similar light, and all of this happens in such a technical way, behind the scenes that end-users are often left out completely. When APIs are done right, and schema, definitions, and scopes are properly defined, and available to everyone in an easy to follow, yet machine readable way, things have the possibility to work out much better for everyone involved.</p>

        <span class="post-date">01 Feb 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2017_01_31_at_2.29.16_pm.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.fitbit.com/fitbit-charge-2-healthcare-integration/">Fitbit recenttly announced a program to pay their wearable users up to $1500 for&nbsp;integrating</a> their Charge 2 into the&nbsp;<span>UnitedHealthcare Motion</span>&nbsp;program powered by Qualcomm Life&rsquo;s 2net Platform. The "UnitedHealthcare Motion is an employer-sponsored wearable device&nbsp;<span>wellness program</span>&nbsp;that offers financial incentives for enrollees who meet daily step goals". Pulling back the curtain just a little bit on the value of your Internet of Things data, and specifically the devices you strap to your body.</p>
<p>I am not a fan of corporations strapping devices to their employees as part of these wellness programs (or for any reason), and using cash incentive to achieve the desired behavior. I feel this is a doorway to some pretty dark human resources strategies, but I do think these events pull back the curtains on what is going on, even just a little bit for users. I am sure it's not Fitbit's intention to include end-users in all of their monetization of their data, but I see this as an opportunity to educate end-users in these situations.</p>
<p>Most Internet users are not aware of the amount of information being gathered, bought and sold when they use the Internet, and their mobile phones. This lack of awareness is translating pretty nicely to the world of connected devices, adding some valuable demographic dimensions, to an already valuable user profile. While insurance companies are interested in improving their margins with this data, they are also interested in the new revenue streams they can create by selling data to other brokers, hedge funds, and more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the only hopes I have in this area is that startups will continue to pull back the curtain on this behavior either intentionally or unintentionally with products, services, and programs like the wellness program that Fitbit is offering. Showing users that there is value in their data, and this can be a positive first step in educating them about what is happening in the tech world. Once they get a taste of making some actual cash from their data, I'm hoping that more users establish an appetite for understanding the value of their information.</p>
<p>I'm counting on future waves of startups blindly disrupting industries by continuing to pull back the curtain, as well existing companies looking to gain a competitive advantage by operating this way. Leveraging market forces against industry leaders is one of the most important tools we have in our toolbox to combat exploitation of our data. You will find me encouraging companies to do this as a disruptive tactic, and as a competitive edge, not because I want to help them, but because I want to help end-users with each wave. It is my way of using their quest for startup success against the practices of the wider&nbsp;industry&nbsp;and leveraging it to help end-users in any way that I can.</p>

        <span class="post-date">01 Feb 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/1027205_health_and_personal_care_project_snake_always_accessible_v2_1920x1080.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iotbutton/">The AWS IoT Button</a>, based on the Amazon Dash Button hardware, was kind of sorta an interesting model, allowing you to trigger virtual things with a physical click of a button, but now they've virtualized their approach, which I guess is a decent enough of an idea (not new), but their implementation is just not that smart. I think they just went from virtual to physical, and back again that they kind of got whiplash, and didn't really think it through before launching.</p>
<p>I'm not big on bashing people's technology implementations, as I would rather focus on shining a light on what is progressive in the space, but the area of <a href="http://embeddable.apievangelist.com">embeddable tooling built using APIs</a> has suffered so much in the last couple years, I'm not keen on big providers further sucking the oxygen out of the room--AWS can do better. Having a big branded virtualized button with a&nbsp;click for more info on one side, and purchase if you click on the other side seems like something your brands suggested, and not your actual consumers or developers.</p>
<p>I can see the physical AWS IoT button getting some traction, even though the majority of the implementations will be cheezy. Making virtualized buttons should behave like the physical thing seems kind of useless. It seems like AWS could have designed a suite of well-designed HTML + JS button and bookmarklets that engineers can make very useful on the web as well as in a mobile environment. The branding, analytics, and overall experience could make things much more interesting&nbsp;than what you have now, and brand partners could get to work wiring these experiences up to make some pretty valuable API calls, and even daisy chain together multiple API calls across providers.</p>
<p><a href="http://embeddable.apievangelist.com">API powered embeddable buttons is one of the areas of the API space that has left me underwhelmed</a>. After we saw significant movement from Twitter and Facebook with some of their embeddable social buttons, there wasn't much else. This seems to common in the wake of big tech companies doing stuff like this, sucking the innovation out of the room--which is why AWS implementation concerns me. I think there is a big opportunity in this conversational interface, bot driven frenzy for someone to step up and do API driven buttons properly, but alas, we end up with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iotbutton/">cheezy big brand buttons like Amazon Dash</a>.</p>

<p>One of the deciding factors of whether or not I put a new online service to use in my business depends on whether or not they have an API. Sometimes I have no&nbsp;choice in the matter, but if I have any say, a service must allow me to move data in and out of their system programmatically, keeping in sync with my own systems, otherwise I will not adopt the service as part of my regular operations.</p>
<p>One platform I have integrated into my operations is the blogging platform Medium. I handpick some of my content for publishing to Medium, pushing to my account from my own management system using their publishing API. This works well for me, as I require that all of my content, images, and videos are created and originate in my own systems, and then syndicate to other platforms secondarily via APIs--the only downside is that I can't actually pull data from Medium via their API into my management system.</p>
<p>The lack of a read API for Medium content doesn't really hurt me, as I <a href="https://indieweb.org/POSSE">employ a POSSE philosophy</a>, but it does hurt other publishers to the platform because I do not curate their content on Medium on a regular basis. I have to manually go to the Medium.com domain to read API related posts (unless it's a known blog RSS feed), which is something I do not always have the time for. I'm will always prioritize content from platforms that allow me to pull into my news curation systems via RSS, Atom, and APIs, and when I have time I will visit siloed platforms like Medium.</p>
<p>I understand that Medium is concerned about control and monetization of their platform, but a more complete and thoughtful API strategy that involves read and write APIs, embeddable solutions, and considering other leading content API strategies would actually benefit them, as well as their publishers. Not doing this will actually hurt publishers like me. The badly behaved folks will still just scrape what they need, and not having a read API will do nothing to stop this.</p>

<p>APIs are playing an increasing role in all aspects of our public life. Our current president has set the precedent that he will be using Twitter as a primary communication channel, cutting off traditional media and other channels--amplifying the importance of the Twitter API when it comes to doing your job as a journalist.</p>
<p>Journalists don't just need to be plugged into to major platform channels like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and others, they also need to be able to conduct research using these platform APIs. Journalists should be fluent in synchronous, and asynchronous pulling of social media and other data via leading APIs. Whether it's pulled through custom programming or using existing tools and services, successful journalists will have a robust toolbox for meeting their needs in this area.</p>
<p>Inversely it will be increasingly important that API platforms consider journalist access to APIs, and consider crafting specific service composition, rate limits, and plans for this level of access. Platforms should also be investing in and incentivizing their 3rd party developers to help develop tooling that aid journalists in their work. Ideally, these solutions would be open source&nbsp;or at least think deeply about monetization strategies in the context of access in support of these activities.</p>
<p>The current political climate should remind us in the API sector that APIs are not just about developing the next generation of startup applications, and are also about enabling end-users, as well as power users like journalists. If you need help thinking through journalist access to a platform, feel free to reach out, and I'm happy to help you think through this level of access from onboarding, to rate limits and the design of your APIs. This stuff is important, and I'm happy to help.</p>

<p>I wish I could write about everything interesting that is going on in the API space, but as a one man show, I struggle to keep up with discovering, reading and understanding what is going on, let alone carving out the time to write something thoughtful about it. Many interesting things get added to my notebook, but I simply do not find the time to finish and publish a story--sadly.</p>
<p>I'm always appreciative of folks who email me ideas for stories based upon interesting things with APIs, but it still doesn't always mean I will find the bandwidth to craft a post. What I really enjoy is when folks ping me about something interesting, but they also write their own story on their own domain, and share via multiple channels like Twitter, LinkedIn, etc. When you do this, it allows me to more easily amplify what you are doing--the chances i will see it are greater.</p>
<p>Even when a company writes about something, I can still choose to augment and add to what has already been written about a subject, via my own blog. Then if I don't have time to craft something I can still amplify what has already been written by a company on Twitter, LinkedIn, and other channels I publish on regularly. I know many companies rely on PR channel to distribute their message, but I don't think this should be instead of publishing on their own blog. Telling stories on your companies blog, reaching out via PR channels, and relying on analysts like me to amplify what you publish makes for&nbsp;a more complete storytelling strategy for your API.</p>

<p>I am pushing forward my security research, and profiling what threat information APIs and platforms are up to. I rarely ever dive into any API without actually signing up for an API, getting some keys, and actually get to work making API calls. I have come across a number of APIs that are just fronts&nbsp;so that they can get in ProgrammableWeb directory, or just issue a press release that they have an API, so I usually prefer to fire things up and validate an API does what is being advertised.</p>
<p>There is no better way to truly get to know an API than to actually make API calls against it and get to work doing some integration. While <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/01/16/profiling-facebook-threatexchange-api/">profiling the Facebook ThreatExchange API</a> I did what I normally do--requested some keys. The platform doesn't allow for self-service access, so I had to wait for a response, which came as an email a couple days later:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello Kin,<br /><br /> Thank you for applying to ThreatExchange! Currently, we are in beta and focused on solving the challenges of companies with dedicated abuse detection or incident response teams seeking to share threat intelligence.<br /> At this moment, we don't feel the product is ready for your use-case, but we hope it will be in the near future and will reach back out once it is. We appreciate your patience and understanding.<br /><br /> Please reach out to us if you feel this message is in error or if you have ideas on how we can best support your interest(s).<br /><br /> Best,<br /><br /> Facebook ThreatExchange Team</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do not fault companies for not giving away instant self-service access to their API resources. There are plenty of badly behaved 3rd party developers out there. I do encourage them to try and consider other uses cases beyond just their partner implementations, and 3rd party developer integrations. Journalists, researchers, regulators, and analysts&nbsp;like me all need access&nbsp;and can bring a variety of benefits to the platform beyond integrations.</p>
<p>When it comes to the Facebook ThreatExchange API I am looking to drum up more attention and interest in what they are up to. I really think that if we are going to do this correctly, it will need a lot of attention, a lot of companies at the table, especially leaders like Facebook who have a significant portion of the threat data. I guess I will take what I've learned and educate myself about other threat information exchange platforms, and focus on those efforts (which seems silly), but without access, it is about all I can do.</p>

This is a topic I have folks reach out to me about regularly, wanting to create such a rating system, for a variety of business and political reasons. It is something I'd like to continue to get ahead of before someone who is&nbsp;eviler than I am (I am pretty evil), decides to set something in motion that doesn't include me (ego).</p>
<p>I may sound elitist saying this (I am), but there are very few people who get the API landscape at this level, understand the scope of this challenge, and can have a productive conversation about how to do this. Within 60 seconds of each Skype (yeah Skype)&nbsp;call I have with individuals about an API rating system I can tell which industry they come from&nbsp;and their understanding of what actually affect the quality of APIs--across the technical, business, and politics layers of operations. You have to have been in the space a while, and seen the positive and negative outcomes of API operations to really get the nuance of how you rank and rate API operations in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>Developing an API rating and ranking system will take a lot of work, the involvement of the right folks, money, and time. This is an area that is floating higher up on my priority list and will be actively working to solidify&nbsp;a vision, before some of the folks I have talked with, ever get their way. The only existing model for this out in the open currently is from my friends at <a href="http://api500.tumblr.com/">the API Rating Agency</a>. They are some fo the handful&nbsp;of folks who I actually trust to execute on a vision of this importance and scale, but alas they ran into some of the common challenges around the scope of making something like this a reality.</p>
<p>I will be continuing to formalizing my definition of API ratings, but will also be soliciting funds to bring together the smart folks in the space who I feel should be contributing to such an important project. If your company, organization, institution, or agency would like to invest in the existence of an API rating and ranking system please contact me directly. I'm looking to fund the crafting of a formal plan in 2017, and need the money to bring folks together to a single location and discuss. Thanks for your support.</p>

        <span class="post-date">25 Jan 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-cards-playing.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/01/19/oracle-acquiring-apiary/">I wrote angrily about Oracle's acquisition of Apiary last week</a>, and this week I find myself deeply considering the API definition landscape, so I wanted to take another look at this event from the 100K view. In 2017, API definitions are touching every aspect of the API lifecycle, from design to deprecation,&nbsp;and are becoming key to defining, automating, and evolving many different industries from <a href="http://amazon.web.services.stack.network/">cloud computing</a> to <a href="http://developer.switchboard.miami.adopta.agency/">human services</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I define API definitions as the specifications, schema, and scopes that are being used to map out the world of APIs. Specifications for describing APIs are nothing new, and approaches to defining data schema are well established as well. However by 2012 things were changing and Swagger emerged as an important tool for describing APIs in JSON, then YAML, using JSON Schema to define the underlying data definition. Around the same time, Apiary got to work on their own API Blueprint for describing APIs, and MSON for helping define the data and the relationships in play. Then, not to be left behind, Mulesoft "jumped" into the game with RAML as well--there are others, but this represents the top three.</p>
<p>In 2016 Swagger was put into the Linux&nbsp;Foundation, under the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.openapis.org">Open API Initiative (OAI)</a> and was reborn as the OpenAPI Spec, something that in 2017 is beginning to bear fruit with version 3.0 of the specification. Adding another dimension to this shift over the last year, we just saw Oracle purchase Apiary, and since Apiary is currently in the OAI, this means that Oracle is now in the OAI. I'm sure it is just a matter of time before Mulesoft also makes the move to join the OAI, but I'm not sure what this would mean for RAML--or what it means for API Blueprint. I do know OpenAPI Spec is the dominate format right now, and OAI is the leading group.</p>
<p>I want to pause for a moment and also point out that Oracle is the company that recently set the precedent that the naming and ordering of our APIs are copyrightable. You know, the naming, ordering,&nbsp;and mapping out of APIs that we are trying to get on the same page within the OAI, with the OpenAPI Spec? Granted, the precedent was set with the Java API, but it won't be long before another company test this theory out on web APIs. With the current views on patenting APIs, I'm guessing that many API providers already see their APIs as something that copyright applies to.</p>
<p>Just as we are all coming together to hammer out a language to describe how we create, manage, and move around the bits that define us as individuals, the companies we operate, our institutions, and even public spaces, the biggest tech companies are positioning for their role at the table. I'm not saying this is good or bad, black or white, I am just pointing out that companies are taking their positions, and that there are some very different opinions on what intellectual property is, and what needs to be openly defined, and licensed so that the web remains interoperable, reusable, and working for everyone equally.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/01/09/the-api-driven-marketplace-that-is-my-digital-self/">I am mapping out all the APIs that are increasingly defining us as individuals</a>. I am also <a href="http://amazon.web.services.stack.network/">mapping out the API resources that are increasingly defining our small businesses, enterprises, institutions, and government agencies</a>. I am doing all of this with OpenAPI Spec. &nbsp; These API definitions will the be used to design, deploy, virtualize, manage, test, monitor, generate SDKs, integrate, and automate almost every aspect of our personal and professional worlds in 2017. The value of these definitions is only going to increase. The importance that these definitions are openly licensed, accessible, shareable, and reusable is only going to increase. We need this API thing to work, and we don't need unhealthy and greedy views on intellectual property jamming up the gears.</p>
<p>I wish I could help folks who view API definitions as yet another intellectual property see that there is more money to be made when these things are left open. In addition to helping folks understand what API definitions are, and the important role they play, I'm going to invest significant resources helping demonstrate how business, institutions, and government can work more smoothly when API definitions are accessible, and openly licensed. I'm optimistic about the OAI and OpenAPI Spec at the moment, but this optimism can't help but feel overshadowed by other movements on the horizon--we'll see how it all goes.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/01/25/the-openapi-specification-version-30-highlights/">The OpenAPI Specification Version 3.0 Highlights</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">25 Jan 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.openapis.org/specification/v3insights"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/openapi_spec_structural_improvements.png" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I am impressed with the work that the Open API Initiative (OAI) working group has accomplished with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.openapis.org/specification/v3insights">version 3.0 release of the OpenAPI Specification</a>. I have had zero involvement in moving the specification forward (something I'm changing), and after coming back to the effort I am impressed with what they've prioritized, and accomplished for this release.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The highlights in version 3.0 of the OpenAPI Spec for me are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Components</strong> - The new components architecture&nbsp;really reflects "APIs" in my opinion, making things modular and reusable.</li>
<li><strong>Body</strong> - Catching up when it comes to allowing the body to be defined separately from the headers&nbsp;and parameters.</li>
<li><strong>Content Negotiation </strong>- You can now define content objects to define the&nbsp;<span>relationship between response objects, media types, and schema.</span></li>
<li><strong>Linking</strong> - It isn't hypermedia, but it is definitely a nod towards hypermedia, allowing the linking of objects.</li>
<li><strong>Webhooks</strong> - You can now define callbacks that can be attached to a subscription operation describing an outbound operation.</li>
<li><strong>Schema</strong> - Increased investment in JSON Schema, including support of `oneOf`, `anyOf` and `not` support, as well allowing for alternative&nbsp;schema now.</li>
<li><strong>Hosts</strong> - You can now have multiple hosts, allowing you to more narrowly define the host for each path.</li>
<li><strong>Examples</strong> - Allows you to better describe, and provide examples of APIs responses and requests.</li>
<li><strong>Version Identifier</strong> - Not a big one, but removing the swagger: "2.0" identifier--it will now just be&nbsp;openapi.</li>
<li><strong>Cookies</strong> - I'm not a big fan of this being introduced, but it makes sense, and I'm sure is usable for many API operators.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.openapis.org/specification/v3insights">The OAI blog provides a five-part series covering the version 3.0 release</a>. These ten areas are the highlights for me. I think they nailed it as far as what was needed, while also pushing into areas like linking and webhooks that I hadn't anticipated. I am looking forward to playing with converting some of my 2.0 specs to be 3.0 compliant--once I am a little more intimate with it, I can do better to estimate how long it will take for me to evolve my platform from 2.0 to 3.0.</p>
<p>I am impressed with what the OpenAPI Spec working group has gotten accomplished. I am optimistic about what is possible with OpenAPI Spec in 2017--something I'm going to be investing in heavily.</p>

<p>Over the holidays <a href="https://github.com/gsa-data/data-gov-dump">I pulled the data.gov index of federal government data</a>, and the next item on my list was to cache the results of the<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://usdigitalregistry.digitalgov.gov/">US Digital Registry API</a><span>&nbsp;, providing me with a list of agencies, and their social media accounts. I pulled the JSON from the API, and then published to the Github repository for this site, so that I could use for several different applications.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Drive Listings Of Federal Agency Social Media</strong><br />I wanted a quick way to get at the Twitter and Github accounts for the federal government, and have in a single location (Github). I've published YAML data to Github, and using Jekyll I've created listings for the Twitter, Github, Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram, and LinkedIn accounts, making them easier to browse when I need them.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Accessible In Machine Readable Format For Others</strong><br />I have several uses for the listing of government agencies and their social media accounts. I needed the data in a machine-readable format on Github so that I could pull remotely, and even check out the Github repository if I need to. This approach also makes the data available for anyone else to fork and put to use in their own way using Github.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Profile The Agencies Using Each Of The Social APIs&nbsp;</strong><br />Now that I have the social media account for these federal gencies&nbsp;pulled using the US Digital Registry API, I'm going to take each of the accounts, and pull their profile details, and any other relevant information using the APIs for each of the social media services. APIs for the win--providing me with a way to quickly profile the US federal government at scale, and stay in tune either real-time or when I think a checkup is required.</span></p>
<p><span>I'm not sure what I'll do next on this project. I'd like to take a look at how active each account is, and maybe check in each week to see if any accounts have gone dormant, picked up in activity, or possibly publishing anything interesting. At this point I just wanted to have the social media landscape for these federal agencies mapped out. I have other social media data beyond what I have displayed on the project site. I just wanted to get going pulling the landscape, then I'll evaluate using the index as an engine for monitoring and tunining in to what government is up to (or not). Once that is done, I'll consider expanding to other social media channels.</span></p>

<p>I have <a href="http://developer.switchboard.miami.adopta.agency/">the first draft of a developer portal</a>&nbsp;ready for an API project I am working on, and before I move forward polishing it too much I wanted to step back and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/01/16/what-are-the-goals-behind-launching-an-api-portal/">think about the goals behind the launch of this API portal</a>, and the intended audience I'm targeting with its operation. I do not want this landing page to just speak to developers, I would like it to speak to as wide of an audience as possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This particular API portal is meant to support the development of human service websites, mobile, and other applications in the Miami area. I do not want to scare off the "normals" with the home page. I want to make sure the language I use speaks to API newbies, while also giving experienced developers what they need to get up and running&nbsp;and solve any problems.</p>
<p>While not all APIs will be targeting this wide of an audience, but when it comes to human services at the municipal level, we need to be reaching as many people as we can. I am looking for the developer area to speak to journalists, policy makers, analysts, interns, and even just data curious citizen activists. I think I have all the essential building blocks of an API portal present, things like getting started, documentation, and support, now I just need to polish the titles, text, and other elements so that they are as plain English&nbsp;as they possibly can.</p>
<p>As I do this I shouldn't be assuming that a user will ever be actually integrating with an API, they might just need to understand the concept, what is possible with the API, and then engage with someone else who will actually be doing the technical heavy lifting. I'm going to have to put down the technical work on this project for a day or so&nbsp;before I can write content that speaks to non-developers--I am just too close to the code right now. I want to be able to craft a coherent explanation of the importance of this particular API&nbsp;and incite someone to walk way thinking about what is possible with a human services API.</p>

        <span class="post-date">24 Jan 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/bw_database_relationships.png" alt="" width="30%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I am keeping a version of an <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification">OpenAPI Spec</a> in sync <a href="http://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-packages/">with a Data Package</a>. It's not a perfect sync because the Data Package doesn't describe the surface area of the API, just the underlying data schema used on the backend. During project discussions, one of the concerns that was brought up focused on the loss of primary and foreign key references. During our next discussion, I wanted to have a more coherent explanation of why this was ok, and this post will help me do that.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/adopta-agency/open-referral-miami/blob/master/_data/api-commons/openapi-spec.yaml">OpenAPI Spec I've created</a> has each resource in the <a href="https://github.com/openreferral/specification/blob/master/datapackage.json">Data Package</a>&nbsp;represented but leaves out the database relationships represented by those keys in the backend. The API defines the basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) for each resource represented, but allows the relationships&nbsp;to be expressed using the URI. Each item in the Data Package has a corresponding path, and each relationship is available as its own path as well--in this case an example might be /locations, and /locations/services/.</p>
<p>All the relationships are defined and enforced in the URI given for each API requests, and HTTP takes care of the indexing, performance, and other considerations using caching, and other basic building blocks of the web. My friend James Higginbotham (<a href="https://twitter.com/launchany">@launchany</a>) compared this to the concept of views in database backend speak, and OpenAPI Spec describes the HTTP version of&nbsp;OCI (oracle), or TSQL (MS SQL)--depending on what you speak. As an old database guy I like that, "web views", but relying on the request and responses employed as part of the API design.</p>
<p>My explanation isn't as coherent as I'd like, but this gives me a start. I'm trying to help database folks who are keepers of the backend, and the schema better understands that what I'm doing with OpenAPI Spec augments and evolves their work. I do not want them to think I am looking to replace or compete with what they are bringing to the table. I'll keep working on this argument because I want to be able to be able to better articulate why API design is an important part of the process, and that&nbsp;defining the API surface area using OpenAPI Spec, as well as the data model in play using specifications like JSON Schema and Data Package is an important thing.</p>

<p>I track on the different approaches used by API providers so that I know where to find examples of leading approaches to API design and deployment. Then I write about them so that I have something to reference across my research. I keep an eye out for <a href="http://hypermedia.apievangelist.com/apis/">API providers who employ hypermedia as part of their API design</a>, as well as companies who are putting HTTP/2 to work as part of their design and deployment.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/docs/managing-an-http-2-connection">The Amazon Alexa Voice Service API employs HTTP/2 as part of their voice-enablement platform</a>. I'm still learning about HTTP/2 so I was pleased to see the amount of education they provide in their documentation, outlining some of the key terms and concepts at play;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Frame:</strong>&nbsp;The basic protocol unit in HTTP/2; each frame serves a different purpose, for example, HEADERS and DATA frames form the basis of HTTP requests and responses.</li>
<li><strong>Stream:</strong>&nbsp;An independent, bi-directional sequence of frames exchanged between a client and server within an HTTP/2 connection. For detailed information, see&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-5">Streams and Multiplexing in RFC 7540</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Interfaces:</strong>&nbsp;AVS exposes interfaces (SpeechRecognizer, AudioPlayer, SynchronizeState, etc.) that provide your product access to Alexa&rsquo;s built-in skills.</li>
<li><strong>Downchannel:</strong>&nbsp;A stream you create in your HTTP/2 connection, which is used to deliver directives from the cloud to your client. The downchannel remains open in a half-closed state from the device and open from AVS for the life of the connection. The downchannel is primarily used to send cloud-initiated directives and audio attachments to your client</li>
<li><strong>Cloud-initiated Directives:</strong>&nbsp;Directives sent from the cloud to your client. For example, when a user adjusts device volume from the Amazon Alexa App, a directive is sent to your product without a corresponding voice request.</li>
</ul>
<p>They also provide details on crafting the&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/docs/avs-http2-requests#headers">HTTP/2 Message Headers</a>, how to construct the&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/docs/avs-http2-requests#messages">HTTP/2 Multipart Messages</a>, and what to expect with&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/docs/avs-http2-requests#responses">HTTP/2 Responses</a>. They have language SDKs in C / C++(<a href="https://nghttp2.org/">nghttp2</a>), C / C++(<a href="http://curl.haxx.se/">curl and libcurl</a>), Java (<a href="https://github.com/square/okhttp">OkHttp</a>), Java <a href="http://netty.io/">Netty</a>), Java(<a href="http://git.eclipse.org/c/jetty/org.eclipse.jetty.project.git/tree/?h=master">Jetty</a>). I am particularly interested in learning more about how the "Cloud-initiated Directives" works, allowing actions to be sent as part of each connection.</p>
<p>I'm tracking on the moving parts so that I can evolve my own understanding of HTTP/2 in action, and start building a list of APIs who are taking a step forward when it comes to their HTTP infrastructure. It helps to have several different providers to point at when I'm talking about new approaches. I also like to aggregate the common elements that are&nbsp;present, and hopefully, begin to establish a common set of building blocks present when HTTP/2 is put to use.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is common for an API to just be a facade for a database. Meaning the data, and content served up via the API is read from and written to a database backend. This is probably the most common way to deploy an API, but increasingly I'm working to eliminate the database behind, and storing the content or data being served up via Github repositories.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/19/providing-yaml-driven-xml-json-and-atom-using-jekyll-and-github/">I find it easier to store individual YAML, JSON, and other machine readable files on Github</a>, and just check out the repository as part of each API deployment. Each API has a different refresh rate determining how often I commit or pull a fresh copy of the content or data, but the API does all of its work with a locally checked out copy of the repository. Eliminating the need for a database backend from the required components to make the API operate.</p>
<p>Why am I doing this? It helps me solve the database challenges when it comes to deploying in containers, and other more modular approaches to deploying APIs as microservices. The API provides a (hopefully) well-designed&nbsp;facade for the data and content stories, and allows me to use my verbs when reading, writing, and managing resources behind. It also injects the benefits of version control, and user and organizational engagement that Github brings to the table.</p>
<p>I'm also using it in on-demand approaches to working with data. I have&nbsp;a lot of government, and other open data stored in Github repositories (free if public), and when I want to work with it, I can spin up a new instance or container, which checks out the latest Github repository, and provides access for reading and writing using a Github OAuth token. When done, the API can be terminated, committing&nbsp;any changes back to the repository, reducing the need for dormant compute resources.</p>
<p>This approach also centralizes the data publicly on Github, allowing anyone else to check out and integrate with the JSON or YAML data and content sources--leveraging Git as the broker. Going down this road I have lost some of the indexing, search&nbsp;and other common database features I enjoy, but I'm slowly evolving the backend API code to work with the YAML or JSON file stores more efficiently. I actually find going back to working with simple static machine-readable files to be refreshing, and using Github makes it even more usable. I will keep writing as I evolve this approach, and provide more open examples of it in action.</p>

<p>I am going through <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/alexa">the Amazon Alexa platform</a>, profiling it as part of <a href="http://voice.apievangelist.com/">my voice API research</a>, and also thinking deeply about the impact voice-enablement, and conversational interfaces will or will not make in our lives.

<p>I do not own any of the voice enabled&nbsp;Amazon devices, but I am playing with <a href="https://echosim.io/">their simulator Echosim.io</a>. I'm not interested in building any skills&nbsp;or applications for Alexa, but I am curious to learn how the platform functions, so I will be developing prototypes&nbsp;so that I can understand things better. One of the things I'm looking to understand as I'm getting up to speed is how the logging for the platform works, so I can evaluate the observability of the voice platform&nbsp;from developers, as well as an end-user perspective.</p>
<p>From a developer perspective, I see that you have access to device&nbsp;synchronize state, user inactivity, and exceptions encountered via the <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/reference/system">Alexa Voice Service System Interface</a>, and from an <a href="http://alexa.amazon.com/spa/index.html#settings">end-user perspective, there is a history section under device settings</a>. It is a decent start from a logging perspective, but I'm thinking that transparency and observability at this level are going to be important to establish trust between end-users and the platform. With a lot of the speculation around the ambient capabilities of these devices, I'm thinking a robust logging, reporting, and auditing layer to Alexa will be critical to making folks feel like it is something they want in their homes.</p>
<p>I'm thinking through the logging layer of my drone platform usage, and what is available to me as end-user, and developer. Alexa provides me another dimension of this logging layer, but this time in the service of voice-enablement. Further rounding off my view of what should be available when it comes to logging, reporting, and observability of the different types of devices we are connecting to the Internet. As I push forward in both these areas of my Internet of Things (IoT) research I will publish my work here on API Evangelist, as well as the individual <a href="http://voice.apievangelist.com/">voice</a>, <a href="http://drones.apievangelist.com/">drone</a>, and <a href="http://logging.apievangelist.com">logging</a> research areas.</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Jan 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2017_01_22_at_8.53.04_pm.png" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I have been looking for a decent search engine API to help me uncover new sources of information across the API space. I've always been frustrated with the APIs in this category since all of the good Google search APIs went away. I need to search the web, and specifically for blog and news posts with API related insights. In an effort to find a suitable solution I recently came across and spent time digging into one called&nbsp;<a href="https://webhose.io/apis.json">Webhose.io, primarily because they had an APIs.JSON file</a>.</p>
<p>Webhose.io integrates data from hundreds of&nbsp;thousands of global online sources in the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://webhose.io/social-media-data">Social Media Data</a>&nbsp;-</strong> Structured data from top social media sites.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://webhose.io/forum-monitoring-api">Forum Monitoring</a>&nbsp;-</strong> Post data from across many forums.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://webhose.io/blog-search-api">Blog Search</a>&nbsp;-</strong> Pulls the latest from blogs even if no RSS feed.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://webhose.io/news-search-api">News Search</a>&nbsp;- </strong>Access to news from PR sites that don't usually have a feed.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://webhose.io/web-search-api">Web Search</a>&nbsp;-</strong> Gives me access to the latest content from many domains on the&nbsp;web.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm not a big fan of forum monitoring (too much noise), but access to social media, blog, news, and web&nbsp;data and content is extremely valuable to me. Webhose.io indexes quite a few domains, and I was able to find <a href="http://apievangelist.com">#mce_temp_url#</a>apievangelist.com, and my girlfriends <a href="http://hackeducation.com">hackeducation.com</a> in there. Webhose.io allows you to query across categories, using a keyword, and by domain, and they also allow you to set how many days back you'd like to search (up to 30 days)--making it great for staying in tune with the latest content.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I like the API mostly because it gets straight to the point, allowing you to quickly sign up for an account, easily craft API calls, then provides valuable, relevant data and content, enriched with tags, sentiment, and other goodies. They also provide a straightforward business model, allowing you to get 1000 free API calls per month, and incremental&nbsp;monthly packages with different quantities from there. I will be wiring up the API to my monitoring system, adding Webhose.io to t<a href="http://stack.apievangelist.com/companies.html">he stack of APIs I use to run API Evangelist</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">20 Jan 2017</span>
        <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-fist.png" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p>I'm thinking about cloud pricing after <a href="http://amazon.web.services.stack.network/">my profiling of over 60 of the AWS API resources</a>, as I play with <a href="http://algorithmic.rotoscope.work/2016/12/05/algorithmic-rotoscope/">building tools on Algorithmia</a>, and evaluate a variety of serverless options. As someone who is regular blindsided by the devious undercurrents of business, while I'm busy focusing on shiny technological objects, I can't help but feel like us developers are contributing to the commoditization of our (currently) valuable skillset when it comes to APIs, microservices, devops, and serverless.</p>
<p>This isn't exclusive to these areas of technology, and I think it is something we've all set into motion with APIs and microservices over the last decade. We are decoupling some very complex, and often large codebases and dependencies that take a certain amount of experience and skills to tackle, and reducing down to individual reusable resources that are automatically scaled, and may not require as many advanced skills to daisy chain and connect together. I'm all for doing this in the spirit of enabling the average business person to accomplish what they need on a daily, but from my experience in the savviness, and deviance of business leaders, I can't help but feel that eventually developer's labor will be devalued in this environment. </p>
<p>If we succeed, all company resources are available via APIs and microservices and all events and actions are present as "serverless" technology, and each individual resource will have a price tag, opening everything up for commoditization and extreme competition--this is good right? There will still be room for a handful of high paid architects in this environment, but new pieces of code will be able to be developed in isolation, at a very reduced price, with a huge amount of competition driving what developers will be paid way down. We are ultimately working against ourselves in this environment, and our best interest by achieving the current vision of "scale". </p>
<p>I do not think that the technology being employed (API, microservices, devops, and serverless) will be entirely responsible for this. Business elements will be a driving force, the constant push for efficiency, scalability, lower costs, and a quest for profits will significantly fuel things. Also, political force like a lack of awareness of the history of labor, and the toxic views of unions in Silicon Valley, set in motion by libertarian white male dominance in venture capital is establishing an extremely rich environment for this to rapidly move into realms that are out of control of the average technology worker--it will happen so quickly we won't even notice it. </p>
<p>This is an area I am just getting started thinking on. It is a feeling that kept bubbling up as I was reviewing Amazon Web Services, and thinking about APIs, microservices, devops, and serverless at a high level. I'm not as knowledgeable on the history of labor as some folks around me, but I know enough that automation sounds good to us in theory, but is something that often benefits those in power, and rarely benefit those in the middle, and at the bottom. I think many of us predominately white male technologists are willfully blind to the role we are playing in our own commoditization and reducing our hard work to something that will barely sustain a living wage in the near future. </p>

<p>One of the side projects I work on regularly is focused on moving forward the conversation around water data. My next wave of work is targeting the <a href="https://drinc.ca.gov/dnn/Applications/DWPRepository.aspx">State of California&nbsp;Drinking Water Program Repository</a>, and help&nbsp;make some of the valuable spreadsheets and CSV files more usable. Here are the six datasets I'm targeting for processing in coming weeks:</p>
<ul>

        <span class="post-date">19 Jan 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/gorilla_red_circuit.jpg" alt="" width="50%" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/19/oracle-boosts-cloud-offering-with-apiary-api-management-tool-acquisition/">Oracle has purchased API design provider Apiary</a>. I'm a big fan of what Apiary does, and what the team has accomplished. I don't trade in Silicon Valley currency, so I'm not going to congratulate the team on their exit. For me, it is just a reminder of how we can't have anything nice in the space. No matter how good your team is, or how good your product or services are, the thousand&nbsp;pound gorillas will always come in the room and fuck things up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am bummed about the acquisition of Apiary because they are essential to my API design origin story. Jakub, Z, and the Apiary team made API definitions to be more about API design&nbsp;than just API documentation. Pushing the conversation earlier on in the API lifecycle, opening up the concept that API definitions could be used for not just documenting your APIs after they are live, and all about design early on in the process, something that opened up for use across every stop along the API life cycle. This resulted in API definitions being core to mocking, deployment, management, SDKs, testing, monitoring, and much, much more. #thankyou</p>
<p>Apiary was something I was proud to support in the API sector--Oracle is not. The negative mark this company has left in the space far outweighs anything good they could possibly do through acquisitions or any new solutions. With this post, I will get the usual waves of people telling me this is "just business", which is code for how people fuck each other over under their capitalist religion. So, go ahead and tell me how I live in a fantasy world, when in reality it is you who live in a fantasy world where it isn't about producing a good product, or service, it is just about your love of money, quest to be rich, and your willingness&nbsp;to allow for good things (and people) to be screwed over along the way.</p>
<p>Over the last&nbsp;decade, I've often been pretty naive about how money works, allowing myself to get overly excited about good people, products, interesting&nbsp;technology, and tooling. You won't find me making these mistakes in the future, even if I have to be a grumpy&nbsp;fucker to new startups that come along. I hate being in the business of telling energetic young startup founders of the realities of the world, throwing a wet blanket on their enthusiasm, but when I do jump on a call with new entrants I will be reminding them of the realities of how all of this works, and that at some point they will be fucking over their end-users and developers--it's just business.</p>
<p>I will be rewriting my history of APIs&nbsp;and will be&nbsp;removing emphasis on Apiary's role in the API design world. Isn't this what white dudes do? It is why it's called "his"-story. The impact they made will remain, and I will always be thankful for, but I'll be damned if I give Oracle any traffic and exposure in my research. Another sad day for the API space, leaving me believing more and more in my <a href="http://techgypsi.es/">Tech Gypsy philosophy</a>&nbsp;that there is no way to have anything nice in the world of technology, and that we will all just have to learn how to survive in the cracks, because power will always creep in and ruin the platforms that we love. :-( ;-( ;-(</p>

<p>The API universe is rapidly expanding as more companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies are sharing data, content, and algorithms using web APIs. It has expanded so much in the last year that I can't keep up with everything that is going on. I can't test new APIs, and the emerging services and tooling from providers who are targeting the space fast enough--that is ok, I'm not sweating it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I do have to prioritize and focus on the areas where I can make the biggest impact when it comes to my understanding, and when it comes to helping the API community. While I will still be maintaining a general awareness of all technologies in 2017 I'm going to be heavily focused on three areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API Definition - </strong>The machine-readable definition of an API interface, security and data models.</li>
<li><strong>Data Schema -</strong> A JSON schema, MSON, or other machine-readable description of data schema.</li>
<li><strong>OAuth Scope </strong>- Shared definitions of OAuth scopes in play for an API and it's resources.</li>
<li><strong>Web Specifications</strong> - Web concepts and specifications that make the web go around.</li>
</ul>
<p>Code plays a significant role, and specific implementations are important, but for me, these four areas represent the core of the API space. Defining, employing, discussing, and sharing in these areas is how the API space will scale, and meet the needs of specific industries. Investing in these areas will make the API sector healthier, stronger, and make an impact when it comes to combatting much of the focus on investment, and proprietary of technology that works against things being truly interoperable reusable.</p>
<p>In 2017 I'm focusing the majority of my work in these areas. These are not the areas where the money will be in the future, but it will be what enables all the areas that do make startups money and make a difference on the ground at small businesses and the enterprise. Investment in common definitions, schema, scopes, and specifications will be the #2 challenge for API sector in coming years, right after security. I'm not sure what I can do on the security front, but I know I can make an impact when it comes to helping define common patterns of the API universe.</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Jan 2017</span>
        <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-trust.png" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p>What happens when we can't trust the numbers our service providers report to us? I personally do not stress over my analytics and traffic, views, and other numbers we are engineering our worlds to run by, but when you are paying for a service--I definitely have an opinion. <a href="http://www.socialmediatoday.com/social-networks/complete-list-facebooks-misreported-metrics-and-what-they-mean">Facebook recently had a series of misreporting events around their metrics</a>, leaving us questioning the numbers we are fed by our service providers on a regular basis.</p>
<p>There is no way that we can be 100% sure our service providers are telling us the truth--we have to trust them. However, there are ways that API providers can be more transparent when it comes to the data behind the numbers. It is easy enough to open up the log files, and other data that went into calculating the numbers when operating a platform. Many of the advertising and other service providers in questions have APIs to control the parts of the systems a platform desires you to perform--they just don't like pulling back the curtain, and showing what is truly going on.</p>
<p>If you do not fully trust your provider's numbers make sure and let them know publicly and privately that you would like access to the raw data behind. APIs can be designed to provide access to any data, as well as provide observability into the algorithms that driving any process. This is not a question of whether it's possible technically, it is a question of whether it is possible politically, and whether or not your service provider is willing to be transparent enough with you to develop the required trust needed for all of this to work properly.</p>

<p>I like to pick worrisome patents from <a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com/">my API patent research</a> and share them on my blog regularly. Last week I talk about&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/01/10/patent-us9300759-b1-api-calls-with-dependencies/">Patent #US9300759 B1: API Calls With Dependencies</a> and today I want to talk about <a href="http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PG01&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=20150363171.PGNR.">patent #US</a><a href="http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PG01&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=20150363171.PGNR.">09471283:&nbsp;Generating virtualized application programming interface (API) implementation from narrative API documentation</a>, which according to its abstract is:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>A virtualized Application Program Interface (API) implementation is generated based upon narrative API documentation that includes sentences that describe the API, by generating programming statements for the virtualized API implementation based on parsing the narrative API documentation and generating the virtualized API implementation based on upon the programming statements for the virtualized API implementation. The parsing of the narrative documentation may use a natural language parser and a domain-specific ontology for the API that may be obtained or created for the API. The virtualized API implementation may be generated using an API virtualizer.</em></p>
<p><span>I generally won't talk smack about folks filing patents, except I'm a pretty strong believer that the API interface and the supporting elements that make an API do the API thing should be left out. All the elements present in this patent like virtualization, documentation, and narrative need to be open--this is how things work. Just when we are all beginning to get good when it comes to crafting useful APIs, learning to speak in complete sentences with multiple APIs, we are going to patent the process of telling stories with APIs? Sorry, it just doesn't compute for me. I know this is what ya'll&nbsp;do at bigcos, but it's counterproductive.</span></p>
<p>Instead of filing this patent I wish they would have taken their idea and launched as open source tool, then also launch an accompanying service running in the cloud, and get to work letting us crafting narratives around our APIs. As I've said before, these patents really mean nothing, and it will all come down to <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/feed/search/?q=%22application+programming+interface%22&amp;order_by=score+desc&amp;stat_Precedential=on&amp;type=o&amp;">keeping an eye on the court filings using the CourtListener API</a>&nbsp;for any cases that are being litigated using API related patents.</p>
<p><span>It won't stop me from complaining, though. I just wish folks would spend their time on more productive things, instead of slowing down the world of APIs.</span></p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/portal_screenshot.jpg" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was getting ready to do some work on a developer portal for a project I'm working on and I wanted to stop, step back and try to define what the goals in launching this portal are. As the technologist on this project, it is easy for me to impose my belief in why I am launching&nbsp;this portal (to publish documentation), but I feel it is important that we get the perspective of all stakeholders--so, I asked everyone involved what the goals were.</p>
<p>In the short term, the goals are to engage these groups around the API resources:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Engage Third-Parties -</strong> Bring in new, and stimulate existing usage of data made available via APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Internal Departments</strong> - Ensure the internal groups are also engaged, and part of the outreach.</li>
</ul>
<p>While incentivizing the following things between engaged stakeholders:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Aware</strong> - Help make people aware of available resources, and what is being done with them.</li>
<li><strong>Conversations</strong> - Stimulate focused conversations&nbsp;among&nbsp;stakeholders around data and APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Issues</strong> - Focus on solving tangible issues that actually make an impact in the community.</li>
</ul>
<p>Long term the goals to stimulate projects that matter, and can possibly bring in sustainable relationships and revenue that will help ensure the platform is up and running, and serving the target audiences. It takes money to do APIs properly, keeping the servers running, code evolving, active outreach and support in the community, and a passionate, engaged community to develop valuable projects.</p>
<p>I know all of this sounds overly simplified, but it is actually the thought process I'm applying to this project. I would say it is oversimplified to say that we are just launching a portal so that people will use our APIs. We need some basic goals about who we are reaching out to, and what we are trying to accomplish--we can evolve, and continue to define from there. When I lay out the outline for this project's portal I will make sure each element that I include speaks to these goals, or I will not put it in the version 1.0 of the portal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, I want to make sure <a href="http://portal.minimum.apievangelist.com/">my minimum viable API portal definition</a> speaks to the widest possible audience, and not just to developers. Then I will get to work on setting up the first version of the portal for use in this API project, and we'll consider what's next.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2017_01_15_at_6.40.58_pm.png" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I'm spending some cycles on discovering what "<a href="http://cybersecurity.apievangelist.com">cybersecurity</a>" or "<a href="http://security.apievangelist.com/">security</a>" API solutions are out there, but specifically looking at threat information related to operating on the web. First up on the list is F<a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/v2.8">acebook's ThreatExchange API</a>, and I wanted to go through and break down what they offer via their API as I work to define an <a href="http://openapis.org">OpenAPI Spec</a>, and their overall API operations as I populate&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>&nbsp;file.This process helps me better understand what Facebook is offering in this area, as well as producing a machine readable definition that I can use across the rest of my research.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, what is Facebook ThreatExchange?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Learn about threats. Share threat information back. Everyone becomes more secure. Most threat intelligence solutions suffer because the data is too hard to standardize and verify. Facebook created the ThreatExchange platform so that participating organizations can share threat data using a convenient, structured, and easy-to-use API that provides privacy controls to enable sharing with only desired groups.</em></p>
<ul style="padding-left: 30px;">
<li>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Scale your intelligence -</strong>&nbsp;Threats like malware and phishing will often attack many targets. Safeguard yourself using shared intelligence from other&nbsp;</em>participants<em>.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>A better way to share -&nbsp;</strong>Utilize a structured platform to send and receive information about threats.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Join ThreatExchange -&nbsp;</strong>Learn about threats. Share threat information back. Everybody becomes more secure. *in beta</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm wanting to understand Facebook's motivations behind doing the ThreatExchange API, and better understand the technical, business, and political aspects of providing a platform like this. When profiling a platform I always start with the endpoints, as I feel like they give the most honest accounting of what is going on.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/malware-analyses">/malware_analyses</a> </strong>- Search for malware samples by hash and other metadata.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/malware-families">/malware_families</a></strong> - Search for malware families by name and other metadata.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/threat-descriptors">/threat_descriptors</a> </strong>- Enables searching for indicators of compromise descriptors.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/threat-indicators">/threat_indicators</a> -</strong> Enables searching for indicators of compromise.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/threat-tags">/threat_tags</a> -</strong> Enables searching for threat tags.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/threat-exchange-members">/threat_exchange_members</a> -</strong> Returns a list of current members of the ThreatExchange.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, I look at the underlying data and object model, and since Facebook uses their Graph model for their ThreatConnect API, it is pretty easy to pick up and get running with things--here are the graph objects used as part of the ThreatExchange:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/malware">Malware</a> </strong>- A sample of the malware.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/malware-family">MalwareFamily</a></strong> - A group, cluster or similar type grouping of&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/malware">Malware</a>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/threat-descriptor">ThreatDescriptor</a> </strong>- The subjective context provided by a&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/threat-exchange-member">ThreatExchangeMember</a>&nbsp;for a&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/threat-indicator">ThreatIndicator</a></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/threat-exchange-member">ThreatExchangeMember</a> </strong>- A participant within ThreatExchange.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/threat-indicator">ThreatIndicator</a> </strong>- An indicator of compromise.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/threattags">ThreatTags</a>&nbsp;-</strong>&nbsp;A label to group threat objects together.</li>
</ul>
<p>Facebook also allows for "types" to be applied across the ThreatConnect objects, adding additional dimensions to the objects available via the API:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/attack-type">AttackType</a> -</strong> The kind of attack a&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/threat-indicator">ThreatIndicator</a>&nbsp;object was associated with.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/indicator-type">IndicatorType</a></strong> - The kind of indicator being described by a&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/threat-indicator">ThreatIndicator</a>&nbsp;object.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/malware-analysis-type">MalwareAnalysisType</a></strong> - A description of the type of malware, see&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/malware-analysis-type">MalwareAnalysisType</a>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/malware-family-type">MalwareFamilyType</a></strong> - A description of the type of logic or automation used to create a&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/malware-family">MalwareFamily</a>&nbsp;object.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/precision-type">PrecisionType</a></strong> - Defines how accurately the threat intelligence detects its intended target, victim or actor.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/privacy-type">PrivacyType</a></strong> - Defines who can access the threat intelligence.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/review-status-type">ReviewStatusType</a></strong> - &gt;A description of how the threat intelligence was vetted.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/severity-type">SeverityType</a></strong> - A description of the dangerousness of the threat associated with a&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/threat-indicator">ThreatIndicator</a>&nbsp;object. The order of the values below is ordered from least severe to most severe.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/signature-type">SignatureType</a></strong> - The kind or format of signature described by a&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/threat-indicator">ThreatIndicator</a>&nbsp;object with&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/threat-type">ThreatType</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<code>SIGNATURE.</code></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/share-level-type">ShareLevelType</a></strong>&nbsp;(aka Traffic Light Protocol or TLP) - A designation of how any object in ThreatExchange may be re-shared both within and outside of ThreatExchange, based on the&nbsp;<a href="https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.us-cert.gov%2Ftlp%2F&amp;h=wAQFD5gM2&amp;s=1">US-CERT's Traffic Light Protocol</a>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/status-type">StatusType</a></strong> - A description of the maliciousness of any object within ThreatExchange.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/threat-type">ThreatType</a></strong> - The kind of threat a&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/threat-indicator">ThreatIndicator</a>&nbsp;object is expressing.</li>
</ul>
<p>I was pleased to see webhook infrastructure available, making things a two-way street, and a little more responsive and real-time. I would also consider a streaming technology at this layer eventually, making it easier to manage at scale.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/webhooks">Webhooks</a></strong>&nbsp; - ThreatExchange Webhooks allow you to receive information in real-time for MalwareAnalyses, ThreatDescriptors, and MalwareFamilies.</li>
</ul>
<p>It was also good to see privacy considerations right out of the box. If you are going to get other companies to participate at this level and share real-world threat information, there have to be granular controls to help mediate the politics of all of this. The Facebook approach also doesn't just deal with identity, groups, and access, it also dictates the sharing of information--I am guessing a logging layer at this level will be needed in the future, with an API for it as well, to enable 3rd party auditing.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/privacy">Privacy Controls</a> </strong>- All submissions to the ThreatExchange API allow for limiting the visibility of any Malware and ThreatDescriptor objects. Currently, ThreatExchange supports three levels of visibility: allow all members; allow a ThreatPrivacyGroup; &nbsp;and allow a whitelist of specific members. The desired privacy setting on an object is specified by the values at the time of a create or edit submission to the API. Privacy settings can also be changed retroactively for data you've already submitted.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/resharing">Reshare</a></strong> - All submissions to the ThreatExchange API allow for defining how the data can be re-shared by its recipients. The level of re-sharing is applied via the share_level attribute.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is where this API becomes an exchange. With the required privacy and sharing controls in place, the submitting of new data, connecting the dots between data, and evolving the history of everything in real time can occur, allowing trusted 3rd parties to not just access data, but confidently share it with the ThreatExchange.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/submitting/v2.8">Submitting New Data</a></strong> - You may submit data to the graph via an HTTP POST request the following URL: <em>https://graph.facebook.com/v2.8/threat_descriptors</em></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/submitting-connections">Submitting Connections</a></strong> - ThreatExchange supports creating connections (aka edges) between ThreatIndicator objects to express relationships. Examples of when this can be useful are for describing URL re-direct chains or domain to IP address relationships.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/editing">Editing Existing Data</a></strong> - The ThreatExchange API allows for editing existing ThreatIndicator objects. As with all Facebook Graph APIs, editing is performed via an HTTP POST request to the object's unique ID URL.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/deleting">Deleting Data</a></strong> - ThreatExchange currently supports true deletes only for connections between ThreatIndicator objects to express relationships. Examples of when this can be useful are for describing URL re-direct chains or domain to IP address relationships.</li>
</ul>
<p>After that, there are some more support level elements present. I track on these elements as part of my indexing with an APIs.json, so that anyone can easily find the code, examples, and other supporting resources without clicking around, and digging through the documentation.</p>

</ul>
<p>There are more general elements of the Facebook Developer community present as well, but this provides a nice roundup of all the elements that make up the Facebook ThreatExchange API, providing one possible blueprint for how we share threat information associated with operating any platform on the web. I'm going to be looking at other solutions in this same space, but I wanted to profile Facebook's effort in this area first, as they probably have the most insight and investment in this area.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What Are Facebook's Motives With ThreatExchange?</strong><br />One thing I want to learn more about is why Facebook would want to do the ThreatExchange. I'm sure they truly want to share the wealth of data they have on threats they have there, but I'm sure they equally want incentivize other tech giants to share their data as well, sweetening the entire pot. I would add that they might also be doing this to alleviate any future regulatory pressures that may unfold around cybersecurity legislation. All we can do is monitor what is going on and see how much Facebook, and others invest into ThreatExcahgne before we will know the full extent of the motivations behind the platform.</p>
<p><strong>A Possible Blueprint For Wider Threat Exchange Model&nbsp;</strong><br />This post is part of my research into <a href="http://apievangelist.com">security</a> and <a href="http://cybersecurity.apievangelist.com">cybersecurity</a>. As with the other areas of my research I am looking for the common building blocks of how APIs are being used to understand, map out, defend, and share threat information. I'm happy to see Facebook being proactive in this area, but this feels like it needs to become an open standard and wider blueprint that can be operated by an independent party, with trusted arrangements from each provider regarding what is being submitted and shared--for it to work properly. I have a lot more research to conduct before I make this determination, but it is where I'm headed with my thinking in this area.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Researcher and Journalist Access To Data On Exchange</strong><br />I applied for access to the Facebook ThreatExchange API, but I'm unsure if I will be given access, being that I am just a blogger. This opens up a wider question, though, regarding opening up this valuable information to researchers, journalists, and 3rd party auditors. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/01/09/service-level-agreements-for-researchers-who-depend-on-apis/">I talked about the need for API access tiers and potentially service level agreements for research and journalists</a>&nbsp;previously, and threat information is definitely an area we need to deeply consider who has access to this important data, in a similar way. We need to be ensuring the privacy of companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies are protected, but we also need to allow for a wider understanding of this problem to be established, with more eyes on the data.</p>
<p><strong>Further Assessment of APIs and Threat Information Solutions</strong><br />I am just getting going with this research, and it will take some time for me to paint a complete picture of the landscape when it comes to online threat data, and how APIs are being used. I'll publish each profile as I complete them, and eventually, I'd like to have a common definition of all the API paths, and underlying schema being employed as part of the leading threat data sharing platforms. If we are going to scale the effort to address this growing problem, we are going to need a wealth of APIs in operation, and ensure they are all speaking a common dialect. I need to develop a better understanding of the politics around the operation of a threat data API, but I'm guessing it is something we don't want in the hands of any single, leading tech provider.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Silicon Valley startups and entrepreneurs love to point out that they are trying to make the world a better place. Over a 25+ year career, I have fallen for the belief that I was improving a situation through technology. Hell, I still do this regularly as the API Evangelist, stating that a certain approach to opening up access to data, content, and algorithms can make things better, when in numerous situations it will not. I walk a fine line with this and I hope that I'm a little more critical about where technology should be applied, and focus primarily on making existing technology more accessible using APIs--not starting new ones.</p>
<p>When you are critical of technology in the current climate, there are plenty of folks you like to push back on you, leaning on the fact that they are trying to make the world a better place. Not sure where this line of bullshit first began but is something I should look into. I mean, when you hang out with enough entrepreneurs you really begin see through the bullshit and hype, and you know that this is all about them selling you something, and then selling you and your data as part of an exit via acquisition or going public. It rarely ever has anything to do with making the world a better place, what was promised as part of the marketing, and helping the average end-user.</p>
<p>This is where my entrepreneur friends have stopped reading&nbsp;and lean on the fact that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">they actually believe they are trying to make the world a better place</span>, and their firm belief that Kin is an annoying hippie. You know I love you. You are a&nbsp;special snowflake. But, you are a minority, I am talking about the other 95% of the system you choose to be willfully ignorant of. If you want some evidence of this in the wild, take a look at all the world saving, innovative, revolution startups out there and how many are dedicated to terms of service?</p>
<p>You know, those little legal documents we agree to for our usage of every device in our life, and every single application we use in our professional and personal worlds. The terms of service touch ALL of our lives, and act as a central force throughout our days--kind of like gravity, except it's a corporate force, not anything natural--pushing down on everything we do. As important as terms of services are, and how big of a role they play in our lives, where is the innovation around these legal documents? You know, the kind that assists the average citizen make sense of all of this bullshit and makes their life better?</p>
<p>There are&nbsp;<a href="https://tosdr.org/">Terms of Service Didn't Read</a>, <a href="https://www.docracy.com">Docracy</a>,&nbsp;and <a href="https://tosback.org/">TOSBack</a>, but they just don't have the resources to tackle this properly. There are some service providers who do a good job of helping users make sense of their own terms of service, but there is NO INNOVATION when it comes to terms of service. There is nothing that serves the end-users over the platforms. With all of the innovation going on out there why isn't there more investment, and solutions in the area of terms of service? I mean, if we are trying to make our user's lives easier with technology, and not more complicated, why isn't there more technology to make sense of this legalese that is governing our lives?</p>
<p>Hint, it is because we aren't out for the greater good. With all the money flowing around out there, I just can't believe there isn't the money to do this right. Provide a suite modern tooling and a wealth of legal resources to tackle this problem properly. If nothing else, let's throw TOS Didn't Read, Docracy, and EFF's TOSBAck more money. Maybe there should be a "guilt tax" imposed on every terms of service owner to pay for an English, human translation of the legal documents that guide their platforms. Maybe there should be a machine-readable schema enforced at the regulatory level, making sure a suite of tools can process, and make sense of TOS changes in real-time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe some day we will stop just saying we are trying to help the world with our technology, and actually invest in what truly does.</p>

<p>This is one of those regular public service announcements that if at all possible, you should be requiring SSL for all your API calls. I recently got an email from the IBM Watson team telling me that they would be enforcing encryption on all calls to the Alchemy API in February.</p>
<p>SSL is something I've started enforcing on my own internal APIs. I do not have wide usage of my APIs by third-party providers, but I do have a variety of systems making calls to my APIs, transmitting some potentially sensitive&nbsp;information--luckily nothing too serious, as I'm just a simple API Evangelist.</p>
<p><a href="http://encryption.apievangelist.com/">Encryption is an area I research regularly</a>, hoping to stay in tune (as much as I can) with where discussions are going when it comes to encryption and API operations. Much of it doesn't apply to the average API provider&nbsp;but requiring encryption for API calls, and emailing your developers when and if you do begin enforcing, is what I'd consider an essential building block for all API providers.</p>
<p>I'll keep crafting a unique blog post each time I receive on of these emails from the APIs I depend on. Hopefully some day soon, all APIs will be SSL by default.</p>

I'm a big fan of what IFTTT enables, but I'm not a big fan of companies who build services that depend on APIs&nbsp;but do not offer APIs in turn, so you don't find me highlighting them as an iPaaS solution.</p>
<p>Instead, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/archive/">you'll find me cheering for Zapier</a>, who has an API, and even though I wish they had more APIs, I am grateful they paying it forward a little bit.

<p>"DataFire natively supports over&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/DataFire/Integrations/tree/master/integrations">250 public APIs</a>&nbsp;including: &bull; Slack &bull; GitHub &bull; Twilio &bull; Trello &bull; Spotify &bull; Instagram &bull; Gmail &bull; Google Analytics &bull; YouTube, as well as MongoDB, RSS feeds, and&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/DataFire/DataFire/blob/master/docs/Integrations.md">custom integrations</a>." They have a <a href="https://github.com/DataFire-flows">sample&nbsp;flows available as an individual Github repositories</a>.&nbsp;Integrations can be added by the URL of an Open API (Swagger) specification or an RSS feed, you can also specify --raml, --io_docs, --wadl, or --api_blueprint.</p>
<p>DataFire is new, so it has a lot of maturing to do as an API framework, but it has EVERYTHING that iPaaS solutions should have at its core in my opinion. It's API definition-driven, its open source,&nbsp;and <a href="http://datafire.io">there is a cloud version that any non-developer user can put to use</a>. DataFire is encouraging everyone to share each of the&nbsp;flows as machine readable templates, each as their own Github repository&nbsp;so that anyone can fork, modify, and put to work. #IMPORTANT</p>
<p>This is the future of iPaaS. There is lots of money to be made in the sector, empowering average business, professional, and individual users when it comes to&nbsp;managing their own bits on the web--if current providers get out of the way. The problem with current solutions is that they work too hard to capture the exhaust of these workflows&nbsp;and limit their execution to specific walled garden platforms. DataFire acknowledges that these flows will need to be executed across all the leading cloud providers, orchestrated in serverless environments, as well as more managed level of service in a single, premium cloud edition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>DataFire is the iPaaS solution I've been waiting to see emerge and will be investing time into learning more about how it works, developing integrations and flows, and telling stories about what others are doing with it. DataFire and DataFire.io needs a lot of polishing before it is ready for use by the average, non-technical IFTTT or Zapier user, but I don't think it won't take much to get it there pretty quickly. I'm stoked to finally have an iPaaS solution that I can get behind 100%.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/medium_storytelling_network2.jpg" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></p>
<p>In addition to <a href="http://kinlane.com/2017/01/05/medium-and-the-importance-of-maintaining-your-own-domain/">using the news of Medium's downsizing as a moment to stop and think about who owns our bits</a>, I wanted to point out what a missed opportunity <a href="https://github.com/Medium/medium-api-docs">the Medium API</a> is. Having an API is no guarantee of success, and after&nbsp;<span class="funding_amount"><span>$</span>132M</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="connecting">in</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="funding_rounds"><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/medium/funding-rounds">3 Rounds</a></span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="connecting">from</span><span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/medium/investors">21 Investors</a>, I'm not sure an API can even help out, but it is fun to speculate about what might be possible if Medium had robust API in operation.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Medium/medium-api-docs">Medium has an API</a>, but it is just a Github repository, with reference to a handful of paths allowing you to get details on yourself, the publications you are part of, and post entries to the site. There are no APIs for allowing me to get the posts of other users, or publications, let alone any of the analytics, or traffic for this. I'm guessing there is no API vision or champion at Medium, which results in the simple, restrictive API we see today.</p>
<p>Many media and content companies see APIs as giving away all the value they are trying to monetize, and are unaware of the control that <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/">modern approaches to API management</a> bring&nbsp;to the table. Many people see the pain that other API pioneers have suffered like Twitter, and want to avoid the same problems, completely unaware that many of Twitter's ecosystem problems were Twitter-induced&nbsp;and not inflicted by 3rd party developer.</p>
<p>If Medium had a proper developer portal, complete set of API paths, proper OAuth controls, and other API management tooling, they could open up innovation in content delivery, publishing, analytics, visualizations, voice, bot, and the numerous of other areas where APIs are changing how we consume, create, and engage with information. I get that control over the user experience is key to the Medium model, but there are examples of how this can be done well, and still have an API. The best part is it only costs you the operation of the API operations.</p>
<p>I do not think more money will save Medium. I think they have to innovate. I think part of this innovation needs to come from the passionate base of users they have already developed. I've seen Medium carefully plot out a path forward when it comes their trusted partners, and there is no reason this type of quality control can't be replicated when it comes to API consumers, as well as the applications and integrations that they develop. The Medium API just seems like a really huge missed opportunity to me, but of course, I'm a little biased.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/01/12/why-i-still-believe-in-apisthe-2017-edition/">Why I Still Believe In APIs--The 2017 Edition</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">12 Jan 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/kl_inapiwetrust_500_filtered.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>As I approach my seventh year as the API Evangelist&nbsp;and find myself squarely in 2017, I wanted to take a moment to better understand, and articulate why I still believe in APIs. To be the API Evangelist I have to believe in this, or I just can't do it. It is how my personality works--if I am not interested, or believe in something, you will never find me doing it for a living, let alone as obsessively as I have delivered API Evangelist.</p>
<p><strong>First, What Does API Mean To Me?</strong><br />There are many, many interpretations, and incarnations of "API" out there. I have a pretty wide definition of what is API, one that spans the technical, business, and politics of APIs. API does not equal REST, although it does employ the same Internet technologies used to drive the web. API is not the latest vendor solution&nbsp;or even standard. The web delivers HTML for humans to consume in the browser, and web APIs deliver machine-readable media types (XML, JSON, Atom, CSV, etc.) for use in other applications. When I say applications, I do not just mean the web, mobile, and devices applications--I mean other applications, as in "<span>the action of putting something into operation".</span>&nbsp;An API has to find harmony between the technical, business, and political aspects of API operations and strike a balance between platform, 3rd party developer, and end-user needs--with every stakeholder being well informed along the way.</p>
<p><strong>I Still Believe Early My API Vision</strong><br />When I close my eyes I still believe in the API vision that captured my attention in 2005 using the Delicious API, again in 2006 with the Amazon S3 and EC2 APIs, and with the Twitter API in 2007. Although today, I better understand that a significant portion of this early vision was very naive, and too trusting in the fact that people (API providers and consumers) would do the right thing with APIs. APIs use Internet technology to make data, content, and algorithms&nbsp;more accessible and observable, securely using the web. APIs can keep private information safe, and ensure only those who should have access do. I believe that an API-first approach can make companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies more agile, flexible, and ultimately more successful. APIs can bring change, and make valuable resources more accessible and usable. When done right.</p>
<p><strong>APIs Are Not Going Away Or Being Replaced</strong><br />Yes, many other technologies are coming along to evolve how we exchange data, content, and algorithms on the web, but doing this as a platform, in a more open, transparent, self-service, and machine-readable way is not going anywhere. I try not to argue in favor of any technological dogma like REST, Hypermedia, GraphQL, and beyond, but I do try to be aware&nbsp;and make recommendations of the benefits, and consequences along the way. Having a website or mobile applications for your business, organization, institution, government agency, and often times individuals isn't going to go away anytime soon. Neither will sharing the same data, content, and algorithms available for use in applications in a machine readable way, for use by 3rd party groups using Internet technology. The term API has gained significant mindshare in the tech space, enjoys use as an acronym in the titles of leading news publications, and has taken root in the vocabulary of average folks, as well as the entrepreneurs, developers, and technology companies who helped popularized the term.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>APIs Are Not Good, Nor Bad, Nor Neutral--People And Companies Are</strong><br />APIs get blamed for a lot of things. They can go away at any time. They are unstable. They are not secure. The list goes on and on, and many also like to think that I blindly evangelize that APIs will make the world better all by themselves--I do not. APIs are a reflection of the individuals, companies, organizations, institutions, and agencies that operate them. In the last seven years, I have seen some very badly behaved API providers, consumers, and companies who are selling services to the sector. Going forward, I will never again be surprised again by how badly behaved folks can be when using APIs, and the appetite for an API-driven surveillance economy that is fueled by greed and fear.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>API Specifications, Schema, and Scopes Are The Most Critical Part</strong><br />I track on over <a href="http://apievangelist.com">75 stops along my definition of the API life cycle</a>, and many of them are very important, but my <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">API definition research</a>, which encompasses the world of API specifications, schema, and scopes will play the most significant role in the future of the web, mobile, and connected device technology. This is why I will be dedicating the majority of my bandwidth to this area in 2017, and beyond. Other areas will get attention from me, but API specifications, schema, and scopes touch on every other aspect of the API sector, as well as almost EVERY business vertical driving our economy today. <a href="https://bbvaopen4u.com/en/actualidad/psd2-and-open-apis-banking-start-exponential-era-fintech-and-online-payments">Industry level standards like PSD2 for the banking </a><a href="https://bbvaopen4u.com/en/actualidad/psd2-and-open-apis-banking-start-exponential-era-fintech-and-online-payments">industry</a> will become clearer in coming years, as a result of the hard work that is going on right now with API definitions.</p>
<p><strong>Help Ensure The Algorithms That Are Increasingly Impacting Our Lives Are Observable</strong><br />APIs provide access to data and content, but they also provide some observability into the black box algorithms that are increasingly governing our world. While APIs can't provide 100% visibility into what algorithms do, or do not do, they can provide access to the inputs, and the outputs of the algorithms, making them more observable. When you combine with modern approaches to API management, it can do this securely, and in a way that considers any end-user, as well as developer and platform interests. I'm going to keep investing in fine tuning my argument for APIs to be used as part of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and the other classifications of algorithms that are being put to use across most business sectors. It's a relatively new area of my API research, but something I will invest more time, and resources into to help push the conversation forward.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>More API Storytelling Is Needed, And The Most Rewarding Part Of What I Do</strong><br />I've done an OK job at instigating other API service providers, API operators, integrators, and individuals to tell their story. I feel that my biggest impact on the space has been producing the <a href="http://apistrat.com">@APIStrat conference</a> with my&nbsp;partner in crime Steve Willmott at 3Scale / Red Hat, which is focused on giving people across the API sector a diverse, and inclusive place to tell their story, on stage and in the hallways. Next, I'd say my regular storytelling on my blog, like <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/">my evergreen post on the secret to Amazon's success</a>, has had the biggest impact, while also being the most rewarding and nourishing part for me personally. I've heard stories about my Amazon blog post being framed on the wall in a bank in Europe, baked into the home page of the IT Portal for government agencies, and many other scenarios. Stories matter. We need more of it. I am optimistic regarding much of the new writing I'm seeing on Medium, but this storytelling being mostly isolated to Medium worries me.</p>
<p><strong>Keep On, </strong>Keep'n<strong> On With API Evangelist The Best I Can</strong><br />I still believe in APIs. Over the last seven years, my belief in what APIs can do has not diminished. My belief in what people are capable of doing with them has tremendously. I enjoy staying in tune with what is going on, and trying to distil it down into something people can use in their own API operations. I think the biggest areas of concern for the API life cycle in coming years will be in the areas of <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">API definitions</a>, <a href="http://security.apievangelist.com/">security</a>, <a href="http://terms-of-service.apievangelist.com/">terms of services</a>, <a href="http://privacy.apievangelist.com">privacy</a>, <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com/">discovery</a>, <a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com/">intellectual property</a>, and <a href="http://investment.apievangelist.com/">venture capital</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just needed to refresh my argument of why I still believe in APIs. Honestly, 2015 and 2016 really stretched my faith when it came to APIs. Once I realized it was primarily a crisis of faith in humans and not in APIs, I was able to find a path forward again with API Evangelist. Really, I couldn't ask for a better career focus. It keeps me reading, learning, and thinking deeply about something that touches all of us, and possesses some really meaningful areas that could make an actual impact on people's lives. Things like <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2016/03/31/gathering-my-thoughts-about-open-referral-and-the-human-services-api/">Open Referral</a>, my work on <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/12/11/my-free-application-for-federal-student-aid-fafsa-api-project/">FAFSA</a>, <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/07/25/taking-a-look-at-whats-next-for-the-environmental-protection-agency-epa-envirofacts-data-service-api/">EPA</a>, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/08/24/setting-a-precedent-when-charging-for-high-volume-access-to-government-apis/">National Park</a>, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/08/22/delivering-value-for-developers-is-first-when-it-comes-to-the-census-bureau-apis/">Census</a>, <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/05/14/the-future-of-public-private-sector-partnerships-being-negotiated-at-the-api-oauth-scope-level/">Energy</a>, <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>, and <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, keep me feeling that APIs can make a positive impact on how our world works.</p>
<p>In 2017 I don't think I need to spend much time convincing people to do APIs. They are already doing this. There is more going on than I can keep track of. I think I need to focus on convincing people to do APIs as open and observable as they possibly can. Push for a balanced approach to not just the technology, but the business and legal side of platform operations, in a way that protects the platform's operations, but also in a way that is looking out for 3rd party developer, and end-user interests. I still believe in APIs, but only if they possess the right balance which I talk about regularly, otherwise they are just another approach to technology that we are letting run amok in our lives.</p>

        <span class="post-date">12 Jan 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/openreferral_logo_green.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I am working with <a href="https://openreferral.org/">Open Referral</a> to evolve the schema for the delivery of human services, as well as helping craft a first draft of the OpenAPI Spec for the API definition. The governing organization is looking to take this to the next level, but there are also a handful of the leading commercial providers at the table, as well other groups closer to the municipalities who are implementing and managing Open211 human service implementations.</p>
<p><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2016/03/31/gathering-my-thoughts-about-open-referral-and-the-human-services-api/">I was working with Open Referral on this before checking out this last summer</a>, and would like to help steward the process, and definition(s) forward further in 2017. This means that we need&nbsp;to speak using a common language when hammering out this specification&nbsp;and be using a common platform where we can record changes, and produce a resulting living document. I will be borrowing from existing work I've done on API definitions, schema, and scope across the API space, and putting together a formal process design specifically for the very public process of defining, and delivering human services at the municipal level.</p>
<p>I use<a href="http://openapis.org"> OpenAPI Spec (openapis.org)</a> as an open, machine readable format to drive this process. It is the leading standard for defining APIs in 2017, and now is officially part of the Linux Foundation. OpenAPI Spec provides all stakeholders in the process with a common language when describing the Open Referral in JSON Schema, as well as the surface area of the API that handles responses &amp; requests made of the underlying schema.</p>
<p><a href="http://adopta-agency.github.io/open-referral-api/">I have an OpenAPI Spec from earlier work</a>&nbsp;on this project, with the <a href="http://adopta-agency.github.io/open-referral-api/api-commons/openapi-spec.json">JSON version</a> of the machine-readable definition, as well as a <a href="https://github.com/adopta-agency/open-referral-api/blob/gh-pages/api-commons/openapi-spec.yaml">YAML edition</a>--OpenAPI Spec allows for JSON or YAML editions, which helps the format speak to a wider, even less technical audience. These current definitions are not complete agreed upon definitions for the human services specification, and are just meant to jumpstart the conversation at this point.</p>
<p>OpenAPI Spec provides us with a common language to use when communicating around the API definition and design process with all stakeholders, in a precise, and machine readable way. OpenAPI Spec can be used to define the master Open Referral definition, as well as the definition of each individual deployment or integration. This opens up the opportunity to conduct a "diff" between the definitions, showing what is compatible, and what is not, at any point in time.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/sponsor_logo_oai_print.jpg" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>The platform I will be using to facilitate this discussion is Github, which provides the version control, "diff", communication, and user interactions that will be required throughout the lifecycle of the Open Referral specification. Allowing each path, parameter, response, request, and other elements to be discussed independently, with all history present. Github also provides an interesting opportunity for developing other tools, <a href="http://apis.json.annotation.apievangelist.com/)">like I have for annotating the API definition as part of the process</a>.</p>
<p>This approach to defining a common data schema and API definition requires that all stakeholders involved become fluent in OpenAPI Spec, and JSON Schema, but is something that I've done successfully with other technical, as well as non-technical teams. This process allows us all to all be on the same page with all discussion around the Open Referral API definition and schema, with the ability to invite and include new participants in the conversation at any time using Github's existing services.</p>
<p>Once a formal draft API specification + underlying JSON schema for Open Referral is established, it will become the machine readable contract&nbsp;and act as a central source of truth regarding the API definition as well as the data model schema. It is a contract that humans can follow, as well as be used to drive almost every other stop along the API life cycle like deployment, mocking, management, testing, monitoring, SDKs, documentation, and more.</p>
<p>This process is not unique to Open Referral. I want to be as public with the process to help other people, who are working to define data schema, understand what is possible when you use APIs, OpenAPI Spec, JSON Schema, and Github. I am also looking to reach the people who do the hard work of delivering human services on the ground in cities&nbsp;and help them understand what is possible with Open Referral. Some day I hope to have a whole suite of server-side, and client-side tooling developed around the standard, empowering cities, organizations, and even commercial groups deliver human services more effectively.</p>

<p>I have <a href="http://portal.minimum.apievangelist.com/">a minimum definition for what I consider to be a good portal for an API</a>, and was spending some time thinking about a baseline definition for the API developer account portion of that portal, as well as potentially any other authenticated, and validated platform user.

<p>These are all building blocks I will add to my <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/">API management research</a>, with an overlap with my <a href="http://portal.minimum.apievangelist.com/">API portal research</a>. I'm not sure how many of them I will end up recommending as part of my formal guide, but it provides a nice set of things that seem like they SHOULD be present in all online services we use. Google also had two other tools present here, that overlap with my <a href="http://security.apievangelist.com/">security</a> and <a href="http://privacy.apievangelist.com">privacy</a> research:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://security.google.com/settings/security/secureaccount?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fmyaccount.google.com%2F">Security Checkup</a></strong> - Protect your account in just a few minutes by reviewing your security settings and activity.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://myaccount.google.com/privacycheckup?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fmyaccount.google.com%2F">Privacy Checkup</a></strong> - Take this quick checkup to review important privacy settings and adjust them to your preference.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am going to be going through Google's privacy and security sections, grabbing any relevant building blocks that providers should be considering as part their API operations as well. For now, I'm just going to add this to the list of things I think should be present in the accounts of third party platform users, whether they are a developer, partner, or otherwise.</p>
<p>I would also like to consider what other providers offer accounts features I'd like to emulate. Like Amazon, Dropbox, and other leading providers. I would also like to take another look at what the <a href="http://3scale.net">API management providers like 3Scale</a> offer in this area. Eventually, I want to have an industry guide that API providers can follow when thinking about what they should be offering as part of their user accounts.</p>

<p><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/01/09/evaluating-a-new-channel-for-publishing-my-bits/">I am evaluating Shutterstock as a new destination for some of my photos and videos</a>. I've been a Shutterstock user for their stock images, but I'm just getting going being a publisher. I thought it was worth noting that as part of their sign up process they require me to upload a copy of my state issued identification&nbsp;before I can sell photos or images as a Shutterstock publisher.</p>
<p>This is something I've encountered with other affiliate&nbsp;, partner, and verified solutions. I've also had domains expire, go into limbo, and I have to fax in or upload my identification. It isn't something I haven't seen with many API providers yet, but I'm guessing it will be something we'll see more of with API providers further locking down their valuable resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not sure how I feel about it being a regular part of the partner and developer validation&nbsp;process--I will have to think about it more. I'm just adding to the list of items I consider as part of the API management process. It makes sense to certify and establish trust with developers, but I'm not 100% sure this is the way to do it in the digital age. IDK, I will consider more, and keep an eye out for other examples of this with other API providers.</p>
<p>Shutterstock publisher isn't necessarily connected directly to the API, but once I'm approved I will be uploading, and managing my account via their API, so it is a developer validation process for me. The topic of developer validation and trust keeps coming up in other discussions for me, and with the increasing number of APIs we are all developing with, it seems like we are going to need a more streamlined, multi-platform, and an API-driven solution to tackle this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For me, it would be nice if this solution was associated with my Github account, which plays a central&nbsp;role in all of my integrations. When possible, I create my developer accounts using my Github authentication. It would be nice if I had some sort of validation, and trust ranking based upon my Github profile, something that would increase the more APIs I use, and establish trust with.</p>
<p>I will file this away under my API <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/">management</a>, <a href="http://authentication.apievangelist.com">authentication</a>, and <a href="http://partners.apievangelist.com/">partner</a> research, and will look for other examples of it in the wild--especially at the partner layer. Certifying that developers are truly&nbsp;human, or possibly truly a valid corporate entity seems like it is something that will only grow in the bot-infested&nbsp;Internet landscape we are building.</p>

<p>I regularly talk about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/30/api-sdks-getting-more-specialized/">the evolving world of API SDKs</a>, showcasing <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/10/05/evolving-the-api-sdk-with-apimatic-dx-kits/">what API service providers like APIMATIC are up to when it comes to orchestration, integration</a>, other dimensions of providing client code for API integrations. A new example of this that I have found in the wild is from <a href="https://www.intercom.com/">communication and support API platform Intercom</a>, with their<a href="https://medium.com/intercom-developers/new-docker-images-for-intercom-sdks-835810cc4ba1#.2b201mdlq"> publishing of Docker images of their API SDKs</a>. This overlaps my <a href="http://sdk.apievangelist.com/">SDK research</a> with the influence that&nbsp;<a href="http://containers.apievangelist.com">containerization</a> is having on the the world of providing and integrating with APIs.</p>
<p><a href="https://developers.intercom.com/docs/docker-sdk-environments">Intercom provides Docker images for their Ruby, Node, Go, and PHP API SDKs</a>. It's a new approach to making API code available to API consumers that I haven't seen before, (potentially) making their integrations easier, and quicker. I like their approach to providing the containers and specifically the fact they are looking for feedback on whether or not having SDK Docker containers offer any benefit to developers. I'm guessing this won't benefit all API integrators, but for those who have successfully adopted a containerized way of life, it might streamline the process and overall time to integration.</p>
<p>I just wanted to have a reference on my blog to their approach. I'll keep an eye on their operations, and see if their SDK Docker images become something that gets some traction when it comes to SDK deliver. Since they are sharing the story on their blog, maybe they'll also provide us with an update in a couple months regarding whether developers found it useful or not. If nothing else, their story has reminded me to keep profiling Intercom, and other similar API providers, as part of my wider API <a href="http://communications.apievangelist.com/">communication</a> and <a href="http://support.apievangelist.com/">support</a> research.</p>

<p>A couple of weeks back, the online note-taking platform Evernote made a significant&nbsp;blunder&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href="https://help.evernote.com/hc/en-us/articles/235660588">releasing a privacy policy update that revealed they would be reading our notes to improve their machine learning algorithms</a>. &nbsp;It is something they have since rolled back with the following statement <em><strong>"Reaffirming Our Commitment to Your Privacy"</strong></em>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Evernote recently announced a change to its privacy policy and received a lot of customer feedback expressing concerns. We&rsquo;ve heard that feedback and we apologize for the poor communication.We have decided not to move forward with those changes that would have taken effect on January 23, 2017. Instead, in the coming </em>months<em> we will be revising our existing Privacy Policy. The main thing to know is this: your notes remain private, just as they&rsquo;ve always been.</em><br /><br /><em>Evernote employees have not read, and do not read, your note content. We only access notes under strictly limited circumstances: where we have your permission, or to comply with our legal obligations.Your </em>privacy,<em> and your trust in Evernote are the most important things to us. They are at the heart of our company, and we will continue to focus on that now and in the future.</em></p>
<p>While I am thankful for their change of heart, I wanted to take a moment to point out the wider online environment that incentivizes this type of behavior. This isn't a single situation with Evernote reading our notes, this is the standard mindset for startups operating online, and via our mobile devices in 2017. This is just one situation that was called out, resulting in a change of heart by the platform. Our digital bits are being harvested in the name of machine learning and artificial intelligence across the platforms we depend on daily for our business and personal lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/01/09/the-api-driven-marketplace-that-is-my-digital-self/">In these startup's quest for profit, and ultimately their grand exit, they are targeting our individual and business bits</a>. Use this free web application. Use this free mobile application. Plug this device in at home on your network. Let our machine learning evaluate your database for insights. Let me read your most personal and intimate thoughts in your diary, journal, and notebook. I will provide you with entertainment, convenience, and insight that you would never be able to achieve on your own, without the magic of artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>In my experience, the position a company takes on their API provides an early warning system for these situations. Evernote sent all the wrong signals to their developer community years ago, letting me know it was not a platform I could depend on, and trust for my business operations, let alone my personal, private thoughts. I was able to get off the platform successfully, but the trick in all of this is identifying other platforms who are primed for making similar decisions&nbsp;and helping the average users understand the motives behind all of these "solutions" we let into our lives, so they can make an educated decision on their own.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Jan 2017</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2017_01_09_at_9.03.01_pm.png" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p>I'm working on the next evolution in my API research, and I'm investing more time and energy into the design of the guides I produce as a result of each area of my research. I've long produced a 20+ page PDF dumps of the leading areas of my research like API design, definitions, deployment, and management, but with the next wave of industry guides, I want to polish my approach a little more. </p>
<p>The biggest critique I get from folks about the API industry guides I produce is that they provide too much information, aren't always polished enough, and sometimes contain some obvious errors. I'm getting better at editing, but this only goes so far, and I'm bringing in a second pair of eyes to review things before they go out. Another thing I'm introducing into the process is the use am of professional design software (Adobe InDesign) rather than just relying on PDF's generated from my internal system with a little HTML spit shine.</p>
<p>While it is taking me longer to dust off my Adobe skills than I anticipated, I am finding the design process to be extremely valuable. I've often dismissed the fact that my API research needed to look good, and that it is more important that it is just available publicly on my websites. This is fine and is something that will continue, but I'm finding a more formal design process is helping me think through all of the material, better understand what is valuable, what is important, and hopefully better tell a story about why it is relevant to the API space. It is helping me take my messy backend data and content, and present it in a more coherent and useful way.</p>
<p>As I'm formalizing my approach using my API definition guide, I'm moving on to my API design guide, and I can't help but see the irony in learning the value of design while publishing a guide on API design, where I highlight the benefits of API design to make sense of our growing digital assets. Once I've applied this new approach to my definition, design, deployment, DNS, and management guides I am going to go back to my API design for these resources, and take what I've learned and applied to the way I share the raw data and content. The lesson that stands out most at the moment, is that less is more, and simple speaks volumes.</p>

<p>I understand that companies file for patents to build their portfolios, and assert their stance in their industry, and when necessary use patents as leverage in negotiations, and in a court of law. There are a number of things that I feel patents logically apply to, but I have trouble understanding why folks insist on patenting things that make the web work, and this whole API thing work.</p>
<p>One such filing is <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect2=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PALL&amp;RefSrch=yes&amp;Query=PN/9300759">patent number&nbsp;US9300759 B1</a>: API Calls With Dependencies, which is defined as:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Techniques are disclosed for a client-and-server architecture where the client makes asynchronous API calls to the client. Where the client makes multiple asynchronous API calls, and where these API calls have dependencies (i.e., a result of one call is used as a parameter in a second call), the client may send the server these multiple asynchronous API calls before execution of a call has completed. The server may then execute these multiple asynchronous API calls, using a result generated from one call as a parameter to another call.</em></p>
<p>Maybe I live in a different dimension than everyone else, but this doesn't sound unique, novel, and really just feels like folks&nbsp;are mapping out all the things that are working on the web and filing for patents. I found this patent while going through the almost <a href="http://amazon.patents.apievangelist.com/">1300 API related patents in Amazon Web Services portfolio</a>. Many of their patents make sense to me, but this one felt like it didn't belong.</p>
<p>When I read these patents I worry about the future of the web. Ultimately I can only <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/?q=%22application+programming+interface%22&amp;type=o&amp;order_by=dateFiled+desc&amp;stat_Precedential=on">monitor the courts for API related patent litigation</a>, and keep an eye out for new cases, as this is where the whole API patent game is going to play out. I'll keep squawking every time I read a patent that doesn't just belong, and when I see any new&nbsp;legal cases I will help shine a light on what is going on.</p>

<p>The importance of a <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">machine readable API definition</a> has grown significantly over the last couple of years, with a lot of attention being spent (rightfully so) on helping educate API providers of the value of having an <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification">OpenAPI Spec</a>, <a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>, or another format. This is something I want to continue contributing to in 2017, but I also want to also shine a light on the importance of having your data schema well defined.</p>
<p>When you look through the documentation of many API providers, some of them provide an example request which might give hints at the underlying data model, but you rarely ever see API providers openly share their schema in any usable format. You do come across some of a complete OpenAPI Spec or API Blueprints from time to time, but usually, when you find API definitions, the schema definition portion is incomplete.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not having your schema well defined, shareable, and machine-readable is one of the contributing factors to a lack of common, shared schema in the API space. We have <a href="http://schema.org/">healthy examples of this in action with Schema.org</a>, but for some reason, many of us don't bring schema front and center in our API operations. We are accepting them as input for our API requests, and returning them with API responses, but don't always share examples of this in our documentation, complete sections in our API definitions, or share JSON Schema as part of our developer resources. All contributing to a lack of consistency within a single API operation, as well as the wider industry.</p>
<p>I am going to spend more time in 2017 talking to people about the schema they use in their API operations and shining a light on existing schema that has been published by API providers. I will be also continuing to support important schema like <a href="https://openreferral.org/">Open Referral</a> that helps streamline how our world works. It is no secret that when we speak using common schema things work smoother and that we will make sense to a wider audience. I hope in 2017 we can invest more in defining and sharing the schema we put to use, and reusing some the most common examples out there.</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Jan 2017</span>
        <p>I spend a lot of time studying and thinking about the "digital bits" that we move around the Internet. Personally, and professionally I am dedicated to quantifying, and understanding those bits that are the most important to us as individuals, professionals, and business owners. Like many other folks who work in the tech sector I have always been good at paying attention to the digital bits, I am just not as good at others when monetizing these bits, adding to my own wealth.</p>
<p>When you talk about this world in the world as much as I have, you see just a handful of responses. Most "normals" aren't very interested in things at this level--they just want to benefit from the Internet&nbsp;and aren't really interested in how it works. People who are associated with the tech sector and understand the value of these bits, often do not see them as "your" bits, they seem them as their bits--something they can extract value from, and generate revenue. Then there are always a handful of "normals" who are interested in understanding more, because of security and privacy concerns, as well as a handful of tech sector folks who actually care about the humans enough to balance the desire to just make profits.</p>
<p><strong>The Imbalance In All OF This Is What Fascinates Me&nbsp;</strong><br />The majority of the "normals" don't care about the complexity of the bits they generate, as well as who has access to them. Folks in the tech sector love to tell me regularly that people don't care about this stuff, they just want the convenience, and for it all to work. However, they are also overwhelmingly interested in the bits you generate each day&nbsp;because there is plenty of money to be made extracting insights from your bits, and selling those insights, as well as the raw bits to other companies so they can do the same. This is why EVERYTHING is being connected to the Internet--the convenience factor is just to incentivize you enough so that you plug it in.</p>
<p>There is a reason this latest wave of tech barons like Facebook, Twitter, and Google are getting wealthy--it is generated from the exhaust from our personal and professional lives. Facebook doesn't make money from me just having a Facebook account, they make money off me regularly using Facebook, sharing details of my life via my home and work computers, and mobile devices. This "exhaust" from our daily lives is why Silicon Valley is looking to invest money in each wave of startups, and why corporations, law enforcement, and government agencies are looking to get their hands on it. If these bits are so important, valuable and sought after, why shouldn't the average citizen be more engaged as part of this? I mean&nbsp;they are our bits, right?</p>
<p>Where the imbalance really comes in for me in all of this, is that technologists agree that these bits are valuable. Many even hold them up to be the source of intelligence for the next generation of algorithms that are increasingly governing our lives. Some even hold up these bits to almost a religious status, and that someday humans will be able to be simply uploaded to the Internet&nbsp;because these bits reflect our human soul. However, the average person shouldn't worry themselves with these bits, do not have any rights to access these bits, let alone be able to assert any sort of control and ownership over these bits and bytes? It is troubling that this is the norm for everything right now.</p>
<p>I operate somewhere in the pragmatic and realistic middle I guess. I do not believe these bits and bytes represent our soul, being, or any other religious stance. I do believe they are a digital reflection of ourselves, though. I do think that my thoughts in my Evernote notebook should not be purely seen as a commodity to enrich their algorithms&nbsp;or the photos of my daughter on Instagram being open for use in advertising--they are my bits. I am fine with the platform that I use generating revenue from my activity, however, I do expect them these bits as mine, and this is a shared partnership when it comes to being a steward of my bits--something I feel has severely gotten out of balance in the current investment climate.</p>
<p><strong>Who Do These Bits Belong To?</strong><br />Only in recent years have I seen more tangible discussion around who these bits belong to. Startup founders I've discussed this with feel pretty strongly that these bits wouldn't exist if it wasn't for their platform--so they belong to them. Increasingly the ISP, cable, and mobile network providers feel they have some right to this information as well. Local and the federal government has also pushed pretty hard to clarify that they should have unfettered access to these bits. Sadly, there aren't more discussions that actually include end-users, the average citizen, and "normals" in these discussions, but I guess this is how power works right? Let's keep them in the dark, while we work this shit out for them.</p>
<p>I guess that I am looking to help shift this balance by being a very vocal "average citizen", and active participant in the tech sector, one who cares about privacy and security. This is why I do API Evangelist--to shine a light on this layer of our increasingly digital world, and be transparent about my own world, so that I can help educate other "normals", and people who care, about this version of our digital self that is being generated, cultivated, and often exploited online without any respect for us as individual human beings. To help quantify the digital version of myself, I wanted to walk through my footprint, and share it with others.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/kinlane_physical_digital_self_publish.jpg" alt="" width="100%" align="center" /></p>
<p><strong>What Makes Up The Digital Version Of Kin Lane?</strong><br />Alongside studying the world of APIs, and how the bits and bytes are being moved around the Interwebz, I regularly try to assess my own online presence, define, a regularly redefine who is Kin Lane on the Internet--this is how I make money, and pay my rent, so it is very important to me. I am always eager to dive in and quantify this presence, because the more I am aware of this digital presence, the more I am able to make it work in the service of what I want, over what other people, companies, and the government want for me. Let's take a stroll through the core services that define my digital self in 2017.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Twitter (@kinlane &amp; @apievangelist)</strong><br />Starting with the most public version of myself, I'd say Twitter is one of the most important digital performances I participate in each day. I have 10 accounts I perform on, Tweeting about what I see, what I write, and many other elements of my personal and professional life. Here are some of the key bits and bytes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Profile </strong>- My Twitter profile, and account details.</li>
<li><strong>Tweets</strong> - My words, thoughts, and observations of the world around me.</li>
<li><strong>Messages</strong> - My private messages with people I know.</li>
<li><strong>Media</strong> - Photos and videos that I have often taken myself.</li>
<li><strong>Lists / Collection</strong> - Curation of the world of Twitter as I see it.</li>
<li><strong>Location</strong> - Where I am when I'm engaging with my network.</li>
<li><strong>Friends</strong> - The people that I know and connect with on Twitter.</li>
<li><strong>Links</strong> - Links to important other important sites in my world.</li>
</ul>
<p>I get that Twitter needs to generate revenue by providing insights about the relationships I have, the role I play in trending topics, and other interesting insights they can extract in aggregate. However, these are my words, thoughts, messages, photos, and friends. Even though these activities connect in the cloud at twitter.com, they are occurring in my home and my physical world via my laptop, tablet, and mobile phone.</p>
<p><strong>Github, Github Pages, and Github Gists (@kinlane, @apievangelist)</strong><br />Twitter is an important channel for me, but I would say that Github plays the most critical role in my professional world of all the services I depend on. I host the majority of my public presence using Github Pages, and I manage all the API driven code that runs my world on Github. Aside from Twitter, I'd say that Github is one of the most important social, and communication channel in my world, used to keep track on what individuals and companies are up to.--here are the bits I track on via Github:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Profile</strong> - My Github profiles for Kin Lane and API Evangelist.</li>
<li><strong>Organizations</strong>&nbsp;- For each of my major project areas I have separate organizations.</li>
<li><strong>Users</strong>&nbsp;- The people that I work with, have relationships with, or just stalk&nbsp;them on Github.</li>
<li><strong>Projects</strong>&nbsp;- I'm beginning to organize my work into projects instead of organizations.</li>
<li><strong>Repositories</strong>&nbsp;- All my public websites, backend APIs, and code that I write lives as repos.</li>
<li><strong>Issues</strong>&nbsp;- I leverage Issues as intended by Github, but also as a tasking system for myself.</li>
<li>Gists&nbsp;- I use Github Gists as part of my storytelling, sharing code, data, and other bits of code.</li>
<li><strong>Search</strong>&nbsp;- I manually, and as part of automated work conduct regular searches across Github.</li>
</ul>
<p>When it comes to what matters in my world as the API Evangelist, Github is the most critical. Many providers have dialed in how to game Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, and other popular channels, but it is much harder to fake a presence on Github. This is where I track on companies and individuals who are doing some the most valuable work on the web--the most important part is it's out in the open.</p>
<p><strong>Facebook (@kinlane &amp; @apievangelist, &amp; @dronerecovery)</strong><br />I would put Facebook more in the personal category, than a professional one, as I have never really found a voice for API Evangelist on Facebook. I tend to use the platform for coordinating with my friends and family, but I am increasingly opening up to the wider public and including folks from my professional world. This doesn't change the conversation around the value of these bits and bytes in my daily life:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Profile</strong> - My Facebook profile, details, and pages.</li>
<li><strong>Posts</strong>&nbsp;- My words, thoughts, and observations of the world around me.</li>
<li><strong>Friends</strong>&nbsp;- My friends, and family, and their networks.</li>
<li><strong>Images</strong>&nbsp;- The photos and images I post to Facebook.</li>
<li><strong>Videos</strong> - The videos and animations I publish to Facebook.</li>
<li><strong>Links</strong>&nbsp;- Links to important other important sites in my world.</li>
<li><strong>Pages</strong> - The versions of this detail that get posted to my Facebook pages.</li>
</ul>
<p>I do not publish much else to Facebook. &nbsp;I don't check-in, or really use it as part of my business operations, so what I do is pretty basic. I am spending more time crafting how-to API videos, and other content and media that is focused on a Facebook audience, so this will change over time, making my perspective on ownership and control over my bits and bytes even more important in coming years.</p>
<p><strong>YouTube (@kinlane, @dronerecovery, @algorotoscope)</strong><br />Historically most of my videos on Youtube have been speaking at conferences, universities, and other gatherings. I've been slowly shifting this, as I hope to produce more how-to API content, as well as significantly shifted with the introduction of my <a href="http://dronerecovery.org">Drone Recovery</a> and <a href="http://algorithmic.rotoscope.work">Algorotoscope</a> work. Youtube's role in my personal and professional world is only going to continue to expand:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Profile</strong> - My Youtube profiles, detail, and history.</li>
<li><strong>Videos</strong> - The videos I publish on Youtube.</li>
<li><strong>Channels</strong> - How I organize things on Youtube.</li>
<li><strong>Playlists</strong> - The curation of content I publish, and discovery.</li>
<li><strong>Comments</strong> - The comments on the videos I've published.</li>
<li><strong>Search</strong> - My search history on Youtube.</li>
</ul>
<p>I do not have a lot of experience working with Youtube in a professional capacity and do not spend a huge amount of time on Youtube watching videos, but its network effect is undeniable. While Twitter and Facebook are growing in significance when it comes to my video bits, Youtube is still number one.</p>
<p><strong>Dropbox</strong><br />While not a very public part of my online self, I use Dropbox a lot for managing a more human side of my online storage of files, videos, and other digital objects. I leverage Dropbox as sharing for planning my conference(s), working on video projects, and a variety of other projects, across many different teams. Here are some of the bits I manage with Dropbox:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Profile</strong> - My profile, details, and Dropbox account.</li>
<li><strong>Files</strong> - Everything I'm storing on Dropbox.</li>
<li><strong>Users</strong> - The users I've added to teams and collaborated with.</li>
<li><strong>Sharing</strong> - The management of sharing&nbsp;files.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm increasingly using the Dropbox API as a way to automate my document, image, video, and other media processing workflows in a way that allows me to plug humans into different stops along the way. It helps me maximize control over the media and other objects I need throughout the work on a daily basis.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Google</strong><br />Google has been a significant player in helping me define my digital self since 2005. However, in recent years I've made an effort to reduce my dependence on Google, but it is something I'm not able to ever do completely. I see Google as the poster child for why we should be mindful of our digital self, the bits we manage online, and why we should be skeptical of free software and tools for our businesses. Here are the bits I'm leveraging Google to manage:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Profile</strong> - My overall Google profile for personal and my business domains.</li>
<li><strong>Email</strong> - Email for my personal and business profiles going back to 2005.</li>
<li><strong>Documents</strong> -&nbsp;All my files for my personal and business profiles going back years.</li>
<li><strong>Calendar</strong> - My secondary calendar, that is tied to my local calendar.</li>
<li><strong>Search</strong> - My search history, and since Google is my primary search engine--significant.</li>
<li><strong>Location</strong> - Where I am at, where I'm going, and where I've been.</li>
<li><strong>Translation</strong> - Translating of near real-time conversations I have with people around the&nbsp;world.</li>
<li><strong>Analytics</strong> - The analytics for all of my public domains.</li>
<li><strong>Forums</strong> - Conversations from a handful of groups I'm part of and run for other projects.</li>
<li><strong>News</strong> - I use Google News as primary news aggregate, with personalized sections and searches.</li>
<li><strong>Hangouts</strong> - I still use Google Hangouts with folks around the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>I would point the finger at shifting the landscape from business software to free, surveillance-style business models. I also point the finger at Google for shifting the overall focus of a free, open, and democratic Internet, towards something that is about making money, generating leads and clicks, and fueling disinformation networks--<em>"Index The Worst Parts of the World and Human Race"</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Slack</strong><br />I like Slack. I get it. However I find it to be a little too noisy and busy, and I find that I can only handle about three active channels at any point in time. Even with all the noise, it is a pretty interesting approach to messaging, and one of my favorite API platforms, so I can't help but put the platform to use in my business and a personal world in helping me manage the following bits:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Profile</strong> - My Slack profile that spans multiple channels.</li>
<li><strong>Channels</strong> - The various Slack channels I'm part of or manage.</li>
<li><strong>Files</strong> - Any file I share as part of my conversations on Slack.</li>
<li><strong>Groups</strong> - The different groups I tune into and participate in.</li>
<li><strong>Search</strong> - My search history across the channels I participate in.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Bots</strong> - Any automate assistant or other tools I've added.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm not a big believer in bots and automated approaches to messaging, but I get why others might be into it. I'm a little more critical about where and how I automate things in my world, and a little biased because I tend to write the code that assists me in operating my world. When it comes to bots, I'm hoping that users are more critical about which bots they give access to, and bot developers provide more transparency into the data they collect, and their security practices.</p>
<p><strong>Eventbrite</strong><br />I have my own conference that I help produce, as well as have played a role in other conferences, so EventBrite can play a pretty significant role in managing the bits for this part of my professional world. Eventbrite helps me manage my bits for use across numerous events&nbsp;but also helps me manage my relationship with the bits of my conference attendees, which are very important to me.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Profile</strong> - My profile and account on Eventbrite.</li>
<li><strong>Events</strong>&nbsp;- The events I've attended and produced on the platform.</li>
<li><strong>Venues</strong>&nbsp;- Venues of the events I'm watching, attending, or operating in.</li>
<li><strong>Users</strong>&nbsp;- The users who are attending events I'm involved with.</li>
<li><strong>Orders</strong>&nbsp;- The orders made for those attending my events.</li>
<li><strong>Reports</strong>&nbsp;- Reports on the details of each event I've managed.</li>
<li><strong>Media</strong>&nbsp;- The media I've uploaded&nbsp;and managed to support events.</li>
</ul>
<p>Eventbrite is an interesting convergence of the physical and digital worlds for me. Tracking on the details of the types of events I attend, which are primarily tech events, but occasionally also other more entertainment, political, and other types of events. If you've ever run a lot of conferences as I have, you understand the importance, value, and scope of information you are tracking about everyone involved. A significant portion of the conference's business model is based on sponsors having access to these bits.</p>
<p><strong>MeetUp</strong><br />when it comes to smaller gatherings, I depend on Meetup to help me manage my involvement. I actively use Meetup to stay in tune with many of the API Meetup groups I frequent, as well as keep tabs on what other interesting types of gatherings are available out there. Here are the bits I track as part of Meetup usage:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Profile</strong>&nbsp;- My Meetup profile, account, and messages.</li>
<li><strong>Groups</strong> - The Meetup groups that operate in various places.</li>
<li><strong>Events</strong>&nbsp;- The Meetup gatherings I've attended or thrown.</li>
<li><strong>Locations</strong>&nbsp;- The different cities where Meetups occur.</li>
<li><strong>Venues</strong>&nbsp;- The venues I've attended and thrown Meetups.</li>
<li><strong>Members</strong>&nbsp;- The members of Meetup groups I'm involved in.</li>
<li><strong>Comments</strong>&nbsp;- The conversations that occur within a group and part of events.</li>
<li><strong>Pictures</strong>&nbsp;- Any pictures that get uploaded in support of an event.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am hyper aware oft he information Meetup tracks from my own usage when attending Meetups, but also my experience running Meetups. I also use the Meetup API to do research on locations, and the different areas that are related to the API industry--so I know what data is available, or not when it comes to profiling users.</p>
<p><strong>CloudFlare</strong><br />I use CloudFlare to manage the DNS for all my domains. They provide me with a professional, API driven set of tools for managing the addressing of my online presence. Most importantly, CloudFlare helps me manage the portion of my digital presence that I own the most, and allows me to extract the most value from the bits I generate each day.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Profile</strong> - My CloudFlare profile, and details of my domain registration.</li>
<li><strong>Firewall</strong>&nbsp;- My firewall settings for my domains.</li>
<li><strong>DNS</strong> - The addressing for all my public and private domains.</li>
<li><strong>Certificates</strong>&nbsp;- The certificates I use to encrypt data and content in transit.</li>
<li><strong>Analytics</strong> - The analytics of traffic, threats, and other details of this layer.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a very important service&nbsp;for me, my business and brand. Choosing the right service to manage the frontline for your online presence is increasingly important these days. CloudFlare plays an important role when it comes to securing my bits, and making sure I can operate safely on the Internet, and stay functioning as a viable independent business.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>GumRoad</strong><br />I use Gumroad to help me sell my white papers, essays, guides, images, video, and other digital goods. &nbsp;They provide a simple way for me to create new products from the digital goods I produce, and give me an interface, as well as an API for adding, managing, and selling things that are as part of my operations.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Profile</strong> - My GumRoad account, profile, and history.</li>
<li><strong>Papers</strong> - All my white papers I sell via Gumroad.</li>
<li><strong>Guides</strong>&nbsp;- All the guides I sell via Gumroad.</li>
<li><strong>Videos</strong>&nbsp;- All the videos I sell via Gumroad.</li>
<li><strong>Images</strong>&nbsp;- All the images and collections I sell via Gumroad.</li>
<li><strong>Offer Codes </strong>- Offer codes I generate for different campaigns.</li>
<li><strong>Sales</strong> - All the sales I've made across my sites, and Gumroad store.</li>
<li><strong>Subscribers</strong> - Any subscribers I have to subscription based products.</li>
</ul>
<p>I like Gumroad because it allows me to sell digital goods one my site, and they just get out of the way. They aren't looking to build a network effect, just empower you to sell your digital goods by providing embeddable tools, and easy to use ordering, checkout, and payment solutions--they make money when you sell things&nbsp;and are successful.</p>
<p><strong>LinkedIn</strong><br />A lot of what I do targets a business audience, making LinkedIn a pretty important social and content platform for me to operate on. I do not agree with LinkedIn's business strategy, and much of what they have done to restrict their developer community makes them of lower value to me, but I still use them to manage a lot of bits online.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Profile</strong> - My LinkedIn profile and resume.</li>
<li><strong>People</strong>&nbsp;- People I know and have relationships with.</li>
<li><strong>Companies</strong>&nbsp;- The companies and organizations I follow.</li>
<li><strong>Jobs</strong>&nbsp;- Employment postings that I keep an eye on, and include in work.</li>
<li><strong>Groups</strong>&nbsp;- The LInkedIn Groups I am part of and manage.</li>
<li><strong>News</strong>&nbsp;- Any news I curate and share via the platform.</li>
<li><strong>Essays</strong> - The essays I write and share via LinkedIn publishing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Like Facebook, I'm looking to expand my business usage of LinkedIn, and minimize its role in my personal world. Their lack of APIs for some of the important bits I manage on the platform makes it hard for me to expand and automate this very much. As a result, it tends to be just a destination for publishing news&nbsp;and engage with people via messaging and groups.</p>
<p><strong>Amazon &amp; Amazon Web Services</strong><br />Amazon is another cornerstone of my operations. They provide me with the core elements of my business operations, and are what I'd consider to be a wholesale provider of some the bits I put to work across my operations. I guess I have to consider the consumer relationship I have with Amazon as well, and the role they play in making sure physical goods arrive on my doorstep, as well as the digital bits I manage on their platform.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Profile</strong> - My Amazon and Amazon Web Services Account.</li>
<li><strong>Compute</strong>&nbsp;- All my compute resources operate in AWS.</li>
<li><strong>Storage</strong>&nbsp;- Amazon is my primary storage account.</li>
<li><strong>Database</strong>&nbsp;- I run several MySQL database on Amazon.</li>
<li><strong>Shopping</strong>&nbsp;- I do a lot of shopping for my personal and professional worlds here.</li>
<li><strong>Books</strong>&nbsp;- I buy and publish books using Amazon publishing.</li>
<li><strong>Guides</strong> - I am looking to expand my publishing of industry guides on Amazon.</li>
</ul>
<p>Amazon is a very tough service for me to replace. I keep everything I run there as generic as possible, staying away from some of their newer, more proprietary services, but when it comes to what I can do at scale, and the costs associated with it--you can't beat Amazon. Aside from Amazon Web Services, I depend on Amazon for my camera equipment, printer, and other things that help me generate and evolve my bits both on, and offline.</p>
<p><strong>Pinboard</strong><br />This is is a very specialized service I use, but has provided a core part of my world for over three years now. I use Pinboard to bookmark news and blog posts I read, images, videos, and any other digital bit of others that I keep track on. Pinboard is my memory, and notebook for everything I read and curate across the Web.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Profile</strong> - My public Pinboard profile, and the private account.</li>
<li><strong>Links</strong> - All the links I've curated on Pinboard.</li>
<li><strong>Tags</strong> - How I've tagged everythign I've curated -- linked to my internal tagging.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have a different relationship with almost every service provider listed on this page, and in some of the cases I have a love/hate relationship with the platform--I need their service, but I don't agree with all of their policies and practices. This IS NOT the case with Pinboard. I absolutely love Pinboard. It is a service that does one thing&nbsp;and does it well, and I'm happy to pay for the service they offer. They do not have any surprises when it comes to helping me manage my bits. They are extremely clear about our partner relationship.</p>
<p><strong>SoundCloud</strong><br />This is where I publish the audio from my world. I've published recorded webinars, audio versions of talks I've given, and Audrey and I publish our Tech Gypsies podcast here. Like Youtube, SoundCloud is a place I'm looking to expand on how I use the platform, to manage the audio side of my digital self with these bits:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Profile</strong> - My SoundCloud profile and account.</li>
<li><strong>Tracks</strong> - Any audio tracks I've published to SoundCloud.</li>
<li><strong>Playlists</strong> - The playlists I've created for my work and others.</li>
<li><strong>Comments</strong> - The ocmments I've made, or have been made on my work.</li>
<li><strong>User</strong> - Any users I've engaged with, liked, followed, or otherwise.</li>
</ul>
<p>At Tech Gypsies (my parent company) been publishing our podcast to SoundCloud each week since April of 2016, and is something we are going to keep doing in 2017. I'm looking to capture more sounds that I can publish here, to accompany some of my videos. I'm also looking at some of the music and sounds of other artists for inclusion in some of my work.</p>
<p><strong>Medium</strong><br />It took me a while to come around to the network effects of publishing on Medium, but I'm there. While I'm not nearly as active here as I am on my other domains, I do syndicate certain pieces here to Medium to tap into these benefits.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Profile</strong> - My Medium profile which is linked to my Twitter profile.</li>
<li><strong>Users</strong> - Anyone that I've followed or has follwed me.</li>
<li><strong>Publications</strong> - The publications I've created or participated in.</li>
<li><strong>Posts</strong> - &nbsp;Any posts I've published to Medium.</li>
<li><strong>Images</strong> - The images I include with any of my posts.</li>
</ul>
<p>After a recent announcement that they would be downsizing at Medium, the benefits of my approach to managing my bits were clear. Many folks have told me I should move my blogs to Medium, and while I'll keep investing time into the platform, it will never receive the same attention as my own properties, because of the revenue they bring to the table.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Flickr</strong><br />I have been a long time Flickr user, and was a paid customer for many years. I still use the platform to manage certain collections of images, including my APIStrat conference, but its dominance as an image and photo manage channel has been reduced due to concerns about the stability of it's parent company Yahoo.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Profile</strong> - My profile and account for Flickr.</li>
<li><strong>Photos</strong> - The photos I've uploaded to Flickr.</li>
<li><strong>Collections</strong> - The collections I've created of my photos.</li>
<li><strong>People</strong> - The people I follow, and engage with around my photos.</li>
<li><strong>Places</strong> - The places where photos have been taken.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Tags</strong> - The tags I apply to photos I've published.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to managing my own digital presence using Flickr, I also use it to discover photos and people, by navigating tags and conducting searches via the site and API. This service contributes pretty significantly to my digital presence because I use them in my blog posts, and other publishing I do online (licensing allowing).&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Instagram</strong><br />I swore off Instagram when they changed their terms of service temporarily so that they could use your photos in advertising without your permission--it is something they have backed off, but I still kind of lost faith in them. I still try to maintain the platform by publishing photos there, and I've recently setup an account for my photography, drone, and algorotoscope work, so I expect my usage will grow again.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Profile</strong> - My Instagram profile and account.</li>
<li><strong>Users</strong> - The users I follow, and who follow me.</li>
<li><strong>Images</strong> - The photos I have taken and published.</li>
<li><strong>Video</strong>&nbsp;- The videos I have taken and published.</li>
<li><strong>Comments</strong> - The comments I've made, and are made on my work.</li>
<li><strong>Likes</strong> - Anything I've liked, and flagged as being intersting.</li>
<li><strong>Tags</strong> - How I tag the images and video I publish.</li>
<li><strong>Locations</strong> - The locations where I've taken photos and videos.</li>
</ul>
<p>I really like Instagram as a solution. My only problem with it really is that they are part of the Facebook ecosystem. As an image management solution, and social network around photos I think its a great idea, I'm just not a big fan of their priorities when it comes to licensing and surveillance.</p>
<p><strong>Paypal</strong><br />My primary payment platform for my business is still Paypal. If I am building an application, or scaling a business I'd be leveraging Stripe, Dwolla, and other leading providers, but because there is still a human element in my payment scenarios I heavily use Paypal.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Profile</strong> - My personal, and business profile on Paypal.</li>
<li><strong>Payments</strong> - Any payments I've made and received.</li>
<li><strong>Payors</strong> - People and companies who have paid me money.</li>
<li><strong>Payees</strong>- People and companies who I've paid money.</li>
<li><strong>Invoices</strong> - The invoices associated with payments.</li>
</ul>
<p>My Paypal is a look at the financial side of my operations. It helps me centralize my money in a way that helps me work with a variety of services, as well as the underlying bank account(s). I can integrate into my site, and use the embeddable tooling that they provide to integrating payments into my sites, and the applications or tooling I develop.</p>
<p><strong>Zapier</strong><br />The majority of automation that occurs on my platform is hand coded&nbsp;because I have these skills. However, there are many services that the integration platform as a service provider Zapier offers which I just can't ignore. Zapier makes integration between common API driven services dead simple--something any non-developer can put to use, and even programmers like me can put to work to save time</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Services</strong> - All of the services I've integrated with Zapier to help automate things.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication</strong> - The authentication tokens I've approved for integration to occur.</li>
<li><strong>Connections</strong> - The formulas employed from connection to connection.</li>
</ul>
<p>Zapier has an API, but it doesn't provide control over my account, services, and the connections, or as they call them--zaps, as I'd like to see. It is a much better solution than IFTTT, who takes a proprietary stance about your services and connections, but in my opinion, we will need to evolve more solutions like <a href="http://datafire.io">DataFire.io</a> to help more normals make sense of all of this.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Core Services I Depend On</strong><br />There are numerous other services I use, but these 20+ are the core services I depend on to make my personal and professional world work. These are the services I depend on to make a living. Some of these services I pay for, and there is a sensible and fair terms of service in place. Other services I do not pay for and put to use because of the network, and other positive effects...even if there is often a term of service in place that extracts value from my data and content--hopefully the positives&nbsp;outweigh&nbsp;the negative for me in the end.</p>
<p><strong>My Domain(s)<br /></strong>Now we come to the most important part of my digital self. The portion of it where I get to have 100% control over how things work, and benefit from all of the value that is generated--this is my domain, where I am a domain expert, across a handful of web domains that I own and operate.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a></strong> - Where I write about the technology, business, and politics of APIs.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://kinlane.com">Kin Lane</a> </strong>- My personal blog, where I talk about tech, politics, and anything else I want.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://api.report">API.Report</a> </strong>- Where I publish the press releases I process each week from the API space.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://theapistack.com/">Stack.Network</a></strong> - My research into the API operations of leading API providers.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://dronerecovery.org">Drone Recovery</a></strong> - Photos and video from my drone work, in an urban and natural environment.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://algorithmic.rotoscope.work">Algorithmic Rotoscope</a></strong> - Applying machine learning textures and filters to images and video.</li>
</ul>
<p>In my world, all roads should begin here&nbsp;and end here. The majority of my work starts here&nbsp;and then gets syndicated to other channels. When this isn't possible, I make sure that I can get my content back out via API, scraping, or good old manual work. My objective in all of this work is to define my entire digital footprint&nbsp;and paint a picture of not just the services I depend on for my online self, but also the valuable little bits that get created, moved around, and ultimately monetized by someone (hopefully that is me).&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Identifying The Bits</strong><br />When you look at my digital self I would say that the two most defined bits of my existence are the blog post&nbsp;and the Tweet. These are the most public bits I produce most frequently, and probably what I'm best known for which also results in me making money. I began focusing on the digital bits I generate and manage as part of my presence on a regular basis because I am the API Evangelist, and I saw companies using APIs to make money off of all of our bits. Amongst it all, I managed to make a living talking about all of this and generate bits (blogs, guides, white papers, talks) that people are interested in, and sometimes they are interested enough to pay me money.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not looking to identify all of my bits just so that I can make money off them, and I'm not looking to deprive companies who work hard to develop platforms and useful tools from sharing the value generated by my traffic, data, content, photos, videos, and other bits I generate. I'm just looking to assert as much control over these digital bits as I possibly can because, well....they are mine. Here are some of the most common bits I'm producing, managing, and in some cases making a living from across these services I use to define my digital self:</p>

<p>All of these digital bits exist for a variety of reasons. Some are more meta, some are casual, while others help me be more informed, organized, and ultimately becomes my research which drives the bits that make me money. I want to respect the digital bits of others that I put to use in my work (images, videos, quotes), and I would like folks to be respectful of my digital bits. I could use some help driving traffic to my sites, and I'm happy to help create unique content, media, and other activities to drive traffic to the services I use, but I want it to be fair, equitable, and acknowledge that these are my digital bits, regardless of the platform, tool, and device where it was generated--it is quite likely that occurred on my laptop, tablet, or mobile phone in my home.</p>
<p><strong>The API Driven Marketplace That Is My Digital Self</strong><br />I understand that I probably think about this stuff a little too much. More than the average person. It is my job, but I can't shake that the average person might want to be a little more aware of this layer of their increasingly digital life. Especially so if you are looking to make a living off your work as an independent progressional (some day), and successfully develop your career in the digital jungle, where everyone is looking to extract as much value from your digital bits, before you ever even can benefit yourself. As a professional, I want to maximize my control over the traffic and other value generated by my labor, asserting control over my digital bits whenever, and wherever I can.</p>
<p>I notice my digital bits flowing around online at this level because this is what I do as API Evangelist, and I'm working to automate as much of it as I can, maximize my digital footprint and presence, while retaining as much control over all of my bits as I possibly can. All of the platforms listed above have APIs. If possible, I only depend on services that have APIs. I don't do this just because of what I do for a living, I do this because it allows me to automate, and syndicate my presence and work more efficiently and effectively. I have active integrations with Facebook, Twitter, Github, and all of the services listed above. I always have a queue of new integrations I need&nbsp;to tackle, and when I do not have time to code, I try to use Zapier&nbsp;or other integration as a service solution.</p>
<p>All of my work is conducted within my domain, within my workshop. Each blog post I write, each image or video I create, and guide, essay, and white paper I produce is crafted on my desktop or the workshops that are kinlane.com, apievangelist.com, and my other web domains, where I operate my open, publicly available digital workbench. Then I use the API for each of the service listed above to then push my bits to each channel, syndicating to Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook Medium, and to my network of sites using Github. I know the APIs of these services intimately, including the bits that are exchanged with each transaction. I have written code to integrate with, and crafted OpenAPI Specs for each of the services listed above--I can close my eyes and see these bits being exchanged daily, and think constantly about how they are exchanged, bought, sold, and leveraged across the platforms above. I know, I have a problem.</p>
<p>I'm sure that all of this sounds a little OCD to some. Most folks I talk to about this stuff do not care&nbsp;and dismiss as out of their realm. Most of the entrepreneurs who get things at this level are too busy making money from any value being generated, they do not have much interest in everyone else understanding all of this. In my opinion, you will either want to understand things at this level, and assert control over your bits, or you will work on these other platforms, allowing others to benefit from what you do online, in your car, and in your home. I don't mind other people generating value from my digital bits, especially if they provide me with valuable services, and the details of the relationship are disclosed, I am informed, and we are in agreement before entering.</p>
<p>I am just getting to know my digital self. Sadly I do not fully understand the terms of service that guide all of these relationships as well as I know the technical details of our relationship. Now that I have more of a handle on which core services I depend on, as well as the digital bits that are exchanged in these digital relationships I have entered into. I'm currently working on profiling the business models, pricing and plans available for each of these services I depend on. After that, I'd like to take a better look at the terms of service, privacy policies, and other legal aspects of these relationships. Maybe then I'll understand more about how my digital bits are being bought and sold on the open market, and what dimensions of my digital self really exist.</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Jan 2017</span>

<p>I came across <a href="https://thesocialplatforms.wordpress.com/2016/11/30/potential-scenarios-for-api-research/">a pretty interesting post on using APIs for research</a>, and the benefits, and challenges that researchers face when depending on APIs. It was another side of API stability and availability that I hadn't considered too much lately. Social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook are rich with findings to be studied across almost any discipline. I regularly find social media API studies at universities from areas like healthcare and Zika virus,&nbsp;algorithmic intellectual property protection, all the way up to US Navy surveillance programs that are studying Twitter.</p>
<p>APIs are being used for research, but there are rarely API platform plans crafted with research in mind. Flexible rate limits, custom terms of service, that give them access to the data they need. I'm assuming that some companies have behind the scenes deals with some universities, or larger enterprise research groups (IBM, etc), as well as government agencies, and police agencies. The problem with this, is that 1) there is no virtual public front door to walk through and understand research levels of access, and 2) the details of partnerships are not publicly, equitable, and auditable by journalists, and other groups.</p>
<p><a href="https://thesocialplatforms.wordpress.com/2016/11/30/potential-scenarios-for-api-research/">The author of this essay provides a lot of details regarding what it is like to depend on APIs for your research</a>. Some of them could put your career in jeopardy if the terms of service, and access levels change before you could finish your research, or dissertation. I'm not sure what the responsibility of API providers should be when it comes to making their resources available for research, but it is something I will be exploring further. I will be reaching out to researchers about their API usage, but will also be helping encourage API providers to share their side of things, and maybe eventually formalize how API providers make their valuable resources available for important research.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/01/09/evaluating-a-new-channel-for-publishing-my-bits/">Evaluating A New Channel For Publishing My Bits</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">09 Jan 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://developers.shutterstock.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/shutterstock_developers_home.png" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I have used <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/home">Shutterstock</a> for some time now when it comes stock images but I've only recently started playing around with their publishing program, hoping to make some money from some of my photos and videos. As with any other channel&nbsp;that I am considering for inclusion in my&nbsp;line-up of tools and services, I am spending time going through their platform and evaluate the tech, business, and political considerations of adding any new service to work into my world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, a service should always have an API. This isn't just because of what I do for a living&nbsp;and my obsession with APIs. This is so that I can integrate seamlessly with my existing operations. Another side of this&nbsp;argument&nbsp;is that I will always be able to get my data and content out of a system, but I am working to be a little more proactive than that. I want my system, that operates within my domain to be the lead, and any new channel I adopt only play second fiddle. In this scenario, each photo or video that I publish to Shutterstock will live within my image and video systems&nbsp;and then&nbsp;with the Shutterstock API, I will publish to the Shutterstock domain as I deem worthy.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://developers.shutterstock.com/">The Shutterstock API</a> (potentially) gives me more access and control over my digital bits&nbsp;and allows me to do more with fewer resources. I do not have to depend on APIs, or a platform's data portability to get my data and content out, I've always possessed this control and ownership from the beginning. Then this control and ownership is&nbsp;now exercised and strengthened in three areas: technology, business, and politics. I technical have control over my bits. I have business control over where they are sold, by whom, and how much of the action they get. I have political control, and when I want to change, evolve, or end the relationship I can do what I think is best for me, and my API Evangelist business.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I still have a lot of reading and learning to do when it comes to understanding the legal terms of services, and the details of my Shutterstock partnership, but a company having an API is increasingly the first step of any new business relationship for me. If I can help it, I will not add any new business relationship into my world unless there is an API. Of course, there are deviations from this, but as a single operator small business, this is critical for me if I expect to be able to scale the technical side of my operations, while also meeting the business and legal requirements I have in place to&nbsp;help me achieve success in my business.</p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Jan 2017</span>
        <p>I've been working with <a href="http://algorithmia.io">Algorithmia</a> to manage a large number of images as part of&nbsp;<a href="http://image.rotoscope.work/">my algorithmic rotoscope side project</a>, and they have a really nice omni-platform approach to allowing me to manage my images and other files I am using in my machine learning workflows. Images, files, and the input and output of heavy object is an essential part of almost any machine learning task, and Algorithmia makes easy to do across the storage platforms we use the most (hopefully).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Algorithmia provides you with local data storage--pretty standard stuff, but they also allow you to connect your Amazon S3 account, or your Dropbox account, and connect to specific folders, buckets, while helping you handle all of your permissions. Maybe I have my blinders on with this because I heavily use Amazon S3 as me default online storage, and Dropbox is my secondary store, but I think the concept still is worth sharing..</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2017_01_06_at_11.14.26_am.png" alt="" width="90%" align="center" /></p>
<p>This allows me to seamlessly manage the objects, documents, files, and other images I store across my operation as part of my machine learning workflow. &nbsp;Algorithmia even provides you with an intuitive way of referencing files, by allowing each Data URI to uniquely identifies files and directories, with each composed of a protocol and a path, with each service having its own unique protocol:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>data:// </strong>Algorithmia hosted data</li>
<li><strong>dropbox:// </strong>Dropbox default connected accounts</li>
<li><strong>S3://</strong> Amazon S3 default connected account</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach dramatically simplifies my operations when working with files, and allows me to leverage the API driven storage services I am already putting to work, while also taking advantage of <a href="https://algorithmia.com/algorithms">the growing number of algorithms available to me in Algorithmia's catalog</a>. In my algorithmic rotoscope project I am breaking videos into individual images, producing 60 images per second of video, and uploading to Amazon S3. Once images are uploaded, I can then run Algorithmia's Deep Filter algorithm against all images, sometimes thousands of images, using their text models, or any of the 25+ I've trained myself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This approach is not limited to just video and images, this is generic to any sort of API driven machine learning orchestration. Just swap out video and images, with mapping, content, or other resource, and then find the relevant machine learning workflow you need to apply, and get to work. While I am having fun playing with my drone videos and texture filters, the approach can be just as easily applied to streamline any sort of marchine learning workflow.</p>
<p>One additional benefit of storing data this way is I've found Dropbox to be a really amazing layer for including humans in the workflow. I leverage Amazon S3 for my wholesale, compute grade storage, but Dropbox is where I publish images, videos, and documents that I need to put in front of humans, or include them in the machine learning workflow. I find this gives them a role in the process, in a way that gives them control over the data, images, videos, and other objects, on a platform they are already comfortable with. I'd encourage Algorithmia, and other providers to also consider including Google Drive as part of this--it would go a long way logically connected with the human portion of the wokflows.</p>
<p>Anyways, I thought Algorithmia's approach to storage was interesting, worth highlight, and something that other providers might consider implementing themselves.</p>

        <span class="post-date">05 Jan 2017</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/company/logos/amazon-aws-logo.jpg" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p><a href="http://amazon.web.services.stack.network/">I just finished crafting API definitions for 66 of the Amazon Web Services</a>. You can find <a href="https://github.com/api-stack/amazon-web-services">it all on Github</a>, indexed with <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/api-stack/amazon-web-services/master/_data/apis.json">an APIs.json</a>. While I wish all API providers would do this hard work on their, I do enjoy the process because it forces me to learn a lot of each API, and the details of what providers are up to. I learned quite a bit about Amazon Web Services going through <a href="http://amazon.web.services.stack.network/">the over 2000 paths that are available across the 66 services</a>. </p>
<p><strong>The Importance Of Consistency Across Teams</strong><br />When you bounce from service to service within the AWS ecosystem you can tell that consistency is a challenge for Amazon. Consistency is lacking in API design, documentation, and other critical areas. This is something that is actually getting worse with some of their newer projects. While the older AWS APIs aren't the best possible design because they are: "?Action= based", at least they are consistent, and the documentation is using the same template. Some of the newer APIs are better designed, but their documentation is all over the place, and they are deviating from the consistency that seemed to exist with some of the older API efforts.  </p>
<p><strong>Clear Picture Of Essential Building Blocks</strong><br />There are a variety of building blocks employed in support of AWS APIs, but there is a pretty clear definition of what are considered to be the essential building blocks that exist across <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ALL AWs APIs</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Documentation</strong> - Overall, developer, and API documentation to support the services.</li>
<li><strong>Getting Started </strong>- What you need to get up and going with any of the AWS solutions.</li>
<li><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong> - A list of the frequently asked questions asked of each service.</li>
<li><strong>Pricing</strong> - The pricing for using each service, with some providing a calculator to assist.</li>
</ul>
<p>Amazon also provides a centralized blog, code, support, and what I'd consider to be essential building blocks, and some of the individual services do a good job linking to these resources, but these four are present across ALL of the AWS services, making them clearly considered to be essential.</p>
<p><strong>Relationship Between CLI and API</strong><br />I think the relationship between CLI and API isn't discussed enough in the API sector but is something that is clearly strong across the AWS ecosystem. I'm seeing more API providers also offer a CLI alongside their API to support different developer tastes, but I think AWS does a good job investing equally in both approaches to putting AWS resources to work. In some cases, I'd say the CLI is better documented than the API, but this wasn't always the case--for the most part they were equally invested in.</p>
<p><strong>API First And Console Second</strong><br />Another area I think Amazon provides an interesting case study is when it comes to the relationship between their human interface vs their API and CLI solutions. Many companies launch their human interface and secondarily provide the one for programmatic access, where Amazon delivered the API and CLI first, and their console came second. With current releases, this seems like it is in sync, but in early days they were API first. I appreciated the AWS teams that provided me a link directly to the AWS console, dropping right into the human interface for the API I'm working with. I have a ranking score of 1-3 for how coupled a company's API is with their human interface, and I'd put Amazon as a 2, with a moderate amount of coupling--with a ranking of 1 meaning that they are well linked (tightly coupled).</p>
<p><strong>Meet Other Folks Doing Interesting Things</strong><br />One of the reasons I'm so transparent with all of my work is that it tends to alert folks to what I'm working on, and is something that attracts like-minded individuals who are headed in a similar direction. Shortly after tweeting out my work, Mike Ralphson (<a href="https://twitter.com/PermittedSoc">@PermittedSoc</a>) shared his <a href="https://github.com/Mermade/openapi_specifications">Github repository of OpenAPI Specs</a>. This will save me a ton of work in verifying paths, making sure header, parameters, errors, and the underlying data model actually gets completed. I will be setting up scripts to keep my definitions in sync with his collection, as well as other folks collections that I'm keeping an eye on.</p>
<p><strong>Change Will Come With New Products & Services</strong><br />I knew that AWS had released a number of new products at their annual conference this year, but I haven't had time to dive in. It was interesting to learn about their efforts in the area of machine learning, and Internet of Things. I also got a good look at their authentication, encryption, identity, access management, and other security-related efforts. I feel like this will continue to be an important offering for all the 1000lb gorilla tech giants--security. Us mere mortals will not be able to muster the resources to do at scale, and AWS scale companies will need a buffet of security solutions for API providers.</p>
<p>I'm going to continue refining <a href="http://amazon.web.services.stack.network/">my Amazon Web Services Stack</a>, but I'm going to also get to work on a similar one for Google and Microsoft. Once I have these three tech giants profiled from this API standpoint, I will step back and see what I can do to compare, and better understand where things are headed. This is tedious work, but I find it worthwhile because it is something that continues to push my understanding of the space forward. As I've said before, crafting an API definition of an API is one of the best ways to get to know an API in an intimate way, second to actually writing some code and integrating with an API for realz. </p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Jan 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-broken-gears.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I enjoy having conversations with "normals" about APIs, especially when they approach me after doing a great deal of research, and are pretty knowledgeable about the landscape, even if they may lack deeper awareness around the technical details. These conversations are important to me&nbsp;because it is these folks that will make the biggest impact with APIs--it won't be the entrepreneurs, developers, architects, and us true believers.</p>
<p>While having one of these conversations yesterday, the topic of API design came up, and we were talking about the differences between seemingly similar APIs like Flickr and Instagram, or maybe Twitter and Facebook. I was asked, "why are these APIs are so different? I thought the whole thing with APIs is that they are interoperable, and make integration easier?" &lt;&lt; I love getting asked this&nbsp;because it helps me see the API space for what it is, not the delusion that many of us API believers are peddling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So why are the designs of APIs so different, even between seemingly similar APIs?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Integration</strong> - APIs make integration into web, mobile, and devices apps easier. It will also make integration with other systems easier. However, very few API providers truly want their APIs to work seamlessly with the competition!</li>
<li><strong>Silos</strong> - Many API providers operate in silos, and I have encountered teams who do almost no due diligence on existing API design patterns, standards, or even looking at the potential competition, and what already exists before crafting their API design strategy.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Intellectual Property -</strong> Not many folks see the separate between their API design, the naming, ordering, and structure of the interface, and their backend API code, resulting in some distorted views of what is proprietary and what is not.</li>
<li><strong>Venture Capital -</strong> The investors in many of the companies behind APIs are not interested in being open and interoperable with others in their industry, resulting in a pretty narrow, and selfish focus when it comes to API design patterns.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a handful of the reasons why APIs are so different. It can be hard for people not immersed in the world of technology to cut through the hype, walled garden belief systems, and delusions we peddle in the world of APIs. What makes it even worse, is when you see APIs become a facade for a variety of industries, and begin masking the unique hype, belief systems, and delusions that exist in these verticals. #FUN</p>
<p>When you are only focused on the technology of APIs this all seems simple, and pretty straightforward. Once you begin layering in the business of APIs things get more complicated, but are doable. It is when you start considering the politics of APIs you begin to see the darker motivations behind doing APIs, seeing more of the illnesses that plague the API sector, and infecting each vertical it touches. All of this contributes to many APIs never living up to the hype, or even pragmatic expectations, and will continue to hurt the bottom line of companies who are doing APIs.&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Jan 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-traffic-light.png" alt="" width="25%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was doing <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/01/03/thinking-about-the-monetization-layer-for-public-data/">some planning around a potential business model for commercial implementations of OpenReferral</a>, which provides Open211 open data and API services for cities, allowing citizens to find local services, and I had separated out two types of metrics: 1) API calls &nbsp;2) API traffic. My partner in crime on the project asked me what the difference was, looking for some clarification on how it might possibly contribute to the bottom line of municipalities looking to fund this important open data work.</p>
<p>So, what is the difference between API call and API traffic in this context?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API Call -</strong> This is the measurement of each call made to the API by web, mobile, and device applications.</li>
<li><strong>API Traffic </strong>- This is the measurement of each click made via URLs / URIs served up as part of any API response.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this context, we are looking to provide municipalities, non-profit organizations, and even commercial efforts that are delivering 211 services in cities around the world. I am not suggesting that every bit of revenue and profit be squeezed out of the operation of these important services, I am simply suggesting that there are ways to generate revenue that can become important in keeping services up and running, and impact the quality of that services--it takes money to do this stuff right.</p>
<p>Think of API traffic like an affiliate program or in service of lead generation. This approach requires the usage of some sort of URL shortener services&nbsp;so that you can broker, and measure each click made on a link served up by an API. This opens up other security and privacy concerns we should think about, but it does provides a potential layer for generating valuable traffic to internal, and partner web and mobile applications. This is just one of several approaches I am considering when <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/01/03/thinking-about-the-monetization-layer-for-public-data/">we are thinking about monetization of open data using APIs</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Jan 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2017_01_04_at_12.13.05_pm.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I look at a lot of <a href="http://minimum.viable.api.operations.definition.apievangelist.com/">API portals</a> and developer areas , and experience a number of innovative approaches from startups, as well as a handful of leading API providers, but the Lufthansa Airlines API portal (which recently came across on my radar) I feel represents the next wave of API providers, as the mainstream business world wakes up to the importance of doing business online in a machine readable way. Their developer program isn't anything amazing, &nbsp;it's pretty run of the mill, but I think it represents the minimum bar for SMB and SMEs out there in 2017.</p>
<p>The Lufthansa developer portal has all the basics including documentation, getting started, an application showcase, blog, and they are using Github, Stack Overflow, Twitter, and have a service status page. They provide APIs for their core business resources including cities, airports, aircraft, and the schedule of their flights. Honestly, it is a pretty boring, mundane representation of an API, something you are unlikely to find written up in Techcrunch, but this is why I like it. In 2017, we are getting down to the boring business of doing business on the web (maybe security will come soon?).</p>
<p>I'm hoping this is what 2017 is all about when it comes to APIs--where average small businesses and enterprises getting their API operations up and running. Its is like 2002 for websites, and 2012 for mobile--APIs are what you do if you are doing business online in 2017. They aren't the latest tech trend or fad, it is about acknowledging there are many applications and systems that will need to integrate with your resources, and having simple, low cost, machine-readable APIs is how you do this. Let's all get down to business in 2017, and leave behind the hype when it comes to the API life cycle.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/01/03/thinking-about-the-monetization-layer-for-public-data/">Thinking About The Monetization Layer For Public Data</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">03 Jan 2017</span>
        <p>This is my walk-through of the concepts involved with the monetization of public data using APIs. In this work I am not advocating that companies should be mindlessly profiting from publicly available data, my intent is to provide a framework for organizations to think through the process of generating revenue from commercial access to public data, acknowledging that it costs money to aggregate, serve up, and keep data up to date and usable for the greater public good--if public data is not accessible, accurate, and up to date it is of no use to anyone.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/07/a-better-understanding-of-government-apis-and-their-consumers-before-considering-charging-for-use/">I have long argued that companies and even government agencies should be able to charge for commercial access to public&nbsp;data</a> and be able to generate revenue to cover operational costs, and even produce much-needed funds that can be applied to the road map. My work in this has been referenced in existing projects,&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/08/24/setting-a-precedent-when-charging-for-high-volume-access-to-government-apis/">such as the Department of Interior and Forest Service looking to generate revenue from commercial access and usage of public data generated&nbsp;by&nbsp;the national parks systems</a>. In my opinion, this conversation around generating revenue from publicly available digital assets should be occurring right alongside the existing conversations that already are going on around publicly available physical assets.</p>
<p><strong>Building Upon The Monetization Strategies Of Leading Cloud Providers</strong><br />My thoughts around generating revenue from public open data is built upon monitoring the strategies of leading online platforms like Amazon Web Services, Google, and others. In 2001 a new approach to providing access to digital resources began to emerge from Internet companies like Amazon and Salesforce, and by 2016, it has become a common way for companies to do business online, providing metered, secure access to valuable corporate and end-users data, content, and other algorithmic resources. This research looks to combine these practices into a single guide that public data stewards can consider as they look to fund their important work.</p>
<p>Do not get me wrong, there are many practices of leading tech providers that I am not looking to replicate when it comes to providing access to public data, let alone generating revenue. Much of the illness in the tech space right now is due to the usage of APIs, it is due to a lack of creative approaches to monetizing digital assets like data and content, and terms of service that do not protect the interest of users. My vantage point is the result of six years studying the technology, business, and politics of the API sector, while also working actively on open data projects within city, state, and federal government--I'm looking to strike a balance between these two worlds.</p>
<p><strong>Using Common Government Services As A Target For Generating Much-Needed Revenue</strong><br />For this research, I am going to use a common example of public data, public services. I am focusing in this area specifically to help develop a strategy for&nbsp;<a href="https://openreferral.org/">Open Referral</a>&nbsp;but it is also a potential model that I can see working beyond just public services. I am looking to leverage&nbsp;<a href="https://apievangelist.com/2016/03/31/gathering-my-thoughts-about-open-referral-and-the-human-services-api/">my existing Open Referral work</a>&nbsp;to help push this concept forward, but at the same time, I am hoping it will also&nbsp;provide&nbsp;me with some public data examples that are familiar to all of my readers, giving me with some relevant ways to explain some potentially abstract concepts like APIs to the average folk we need to convince.</p>
<p>For the sake of this discussion things down and focus on three areas of public data, which could be put to work in any city across the country:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Organizations</strong>&nbsp;- The business listings and details for public and private sector agencies, businesses, organizations, and institutions.</li>
<li><strong>Locations</strong>&nbsp;- The details of specific locations which organizations are providing access to public services.</li>
<li><strong>Services</strong>&nbsp;- The listings and details of public services offered at the municipal, county, state, or federal levels of government.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://openreferral.org/">Open Referral is a common definition for describing public services organizations, locations, and services, allowing the government, organizations, institutions, and companies to share data in a common way,</a> which focuses on helping&nbsp;them better serve their&nbsp;constituents--this is what public data is all about, right? The trick is getting all players at the table to speak a common language, one that serves their constituents, and allows them to also make money.</p>
<p>While some open data people may snicker at me suggesting that revenue should be generated on top of open data describing public services, the reality is that this is already occurring--there are numerous companies in this space. The big difference is it is currently being done within silos, locked up in databases, and only accessible to those with the privileges and the technical expertise required. I am looking to bring the data, and the monetization out of the shadows, and expand on it in a transparent way that benefits everybody involved.</p>
<p><strong>Using APIs To Make Public Data More Accessible and Usable In A Collaborative Way</strong><br />Publicly available data plays a central role in driving websites, mobile applications, and system to system integrations, but&nbsp;simply&nbsp;making this data available for download only serves a small portion of these needs, and often does so in a very disconnected way, establishing data silos where data is duplicated, and the accuracy of data is often in question. Web APIs are increasingly being used to make data not just available for downloading, but also allow it to be updated, and deleted in a secure way, by trusted parties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For this example I am looking provide three separate API paths, which will give access to our public services data:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>http://example.com/organizations/ -&nbsp;</strong>Returns JSON or XML listing and details of organizations for use in other applications.</li>
<li><strong>http://example.com/locations/ -</strong>&nbsp;Returns JSON or XML listing and details of organizational locations&nbsp;for use in other applications.</li>
<li><strong>http://example.com/services/ -</strong>&nbsp;Returns JSON or XML listing and details of public services&nbsp;for use in other applications.</li>
</ul>
<p>A website provides HTML information for humans, and web APIs provides machine readable representations of the same data, making it open for use&nbsp;in a single website, but also potentially multiple websites, mobile applications, visualizations, and other important use cases. The mandate for public data should ensure it isn't available on a single website&nbsp;but is as many scenarios that empower end-users as is possible. This is what APIs excel at, but is also something that takes resources to do properly, making the case for generating revenue to properly fund the operations of APIs in the service of the public good.</p>
<p><strong>The Business of Public Data Using Modern Approaches to API Management</strong><br />One of the common misconceptions of public web APIs is that they are open to anyone with access to the Internet, with no restrictions. This might be the case for some APIs, but increasingly government agency, organizations, and institutions are making public data available securely using common API management practices defined by the Internet pioneers like Salesforce, Amazon, and Google over the last decade.</p>
<p>API management practices provide some important layers on top of public data resources, allowing for a greater understanding and control over how data is accessed and put to use. I want to provide an overview of how this works&nbsp;before I dive into the details of this approach by outlining some&nbsp;of the tenets of an API management layer:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Users</strong>&nbsp;- Requiring users to register, establishing a unique account for associated all API and public data activity.</li>
<li><strong>Applications</strong>&nbsp;- Requiring users to define the application (the web, mobile, visualization, etc.) and other viable information regarding their access to the public data.</li>
<li><strong>Keys</strong>&nbsp;- Issuing of unique API keys for each application, requiring their inclusion in all consumption of public data via the API.</li>
<li><strong>Service Composition&nbsp;</strong>- Placement of public data resource (organizations, locations, services) into tiers, defining which APIs different users have access to&nbsp;and the scope of that access.
<ul>
<li><strong>Resource Specific -&nbsp;</strong>Allowing access to specific data resources to a select audience.</li>
<li><strong>Read / Write&nbsp;</strong>- Restricting write access to select users and applications.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Data Specific -</strong>&nbsp;Limiting which data is returned, filtering based&nbsp;on&nbsp;who is requesting it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Rate Limits&nbsp;</strong>- All APIs are rate limited, allowing for different levels of access to public data resources, which can be defined in alignment with the costs associated with operations.</li>
<li><strong>Logging</strong>&nbsp;- Each API call is logged, with required user application keys, as well as details of the request and response associated with each API call.</li>
<li><strong>Analytics</strong>&nbsp;- The presence of a variety of visual layers that establish an awareness of who is accessing public data APIs, what they are accessing, and details on how and where it is being applied.</li>
</ul>
<p>These seven areas provide some very flexible variables which can be applied to the technical, business, and politics of providing access to public data using the Internet. Before you can access the organizations, locations, and service information via this example public services API you will need to be a registered user, with an approved application, possessing valid API keys. Each call to the API will contain these keys, identifying which tier of access an application is operating within, which API paths are available, the rate limits in existence, and logging of everything you consume and add so it can be included as part of any operational analytics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This layer enables more control over public data assets, while also ensuring data is available and accessible. When done thoughtfully, this can open up entirely new approaches to monetization of commercial usage by allowing for increased rate limits, performance, and service level agreements, which can be used to help fund the public data's mandate to be accessible by the public, researchers, and auditors.</p>
<p><strong>Providing The Required Level Of Control Over Public Data Access</strong><br />Understandably, there concerns when it comes to publishing data on the Internet. Unless you have experience working with modern approaches to delivering APIs it can be easy to focus on losing control over your data when publishing on the web--when in reality data stewards of public data can gain more control over their data when using APIs over just publishing for a complete download. There are some distinct ways that API providers are leveraging modern API management practices to evolve greater levels of control over who accesses data, and how it is put to use.</p>
<p>I wanted to highlight what can be brought to the table by employing APIs in service of public data, to help anyone make the argument for why providing machine readable data via APIs is just as important as having a website in 2016:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Awareness</strong>&nbsp;- Requiring all data to be accessed via APIs which required keys to be used for&nbsp;<span>ALL</span>&nbsp;applications, combined with a comprehensive logging strategy, brings a new level of awareness regarding which data is accessed, and how it is being used, or not used.</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong>&nbsp;- While API keys&nbsp;are primarily used for logging and analytics, it also ensures that all public data resources are secured, providing tiered levels of access to 3rd parties based upon trust, contributing value to the data, and overall platform involvement--allowing data to be securely made available on the open web.</li>
<li><strong>Quality Control -</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;APIs act as central gatekeeper regarding how data is updated, evolved, and deleted, allowing for a centralized, yet also potentially distributed, and collaborative approach to ensuring public data is accurate, possessing a high level of quality control.</li>
<li><strong>Terms of Service -&nbsp;</strong>All API usage is governed by the legal terms of service laid out as part of platform operations, requiring all users to respect and follow terms of service if they expect to maintain their public data API keys.</li>
<li><strong>Governance</strong>&nbsp;- Opening up the overall management of the availability, usability, integrity, and security of the public data which may include oversight from governing body or council, a defined set of procedures, and a plan to execute those procedures.</li>
<li><strong>Provenance</strong>&nbsp;- Enabling visibility into the origins, history, and oversight of public data, helping establish the chain of custody regarding shared use of valuable data across platform operations.</li>
<li><strong>Observability</strong>&nbsp;- Allowing for the observability of data resources, and its contributors and consumers using existing platform outputs and mechanisms, enabling high levels of awareness through the API management framework employed as part of platform operations, meeting service level agreements, and expected availability.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to discuss, and quantify this control layer of any public data being made available via&nbsp;APIs if we are going to talk about monetization. Having APIs is not enough to ensure platform success, and sometimes too strict of control can suffocate consumption and contribution, but a lack of some control elements can also have a similar effect, encouraging the type of consumption and contribution that might not benefit a platform's success. A balanced approach to control, with a sensible approach to management and&nbsp;monetization, has helped API pioneers like Amazon achieve new levels of innovation, and domination using APIs--some of this way of thinking can be applied to public data by other organizations.</p>
<p><strong>Enabling and Ensuring Access To Public Data For Everyone It Touches</strong><br />Providing access to data through a variety of channels for commercial and non-commercial purposes is what modern API management infrastructure is all about. Shortly after possessing a website became normal operating procedure for companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies, web APIs began to emerge to power networks of distributed websites, embeddable widgets, and then mobile applications for many different service providers. APIs can provide access to public data, while modern API management practices ensure that access is balanced and in alignment with platform objectives--resulting in the desired level of control discussed above.</p>
<p>There are a number of areas of access that can be opened up by employing APIs in the service of public data:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Internal</strong>&nbsp;- APIs can be used by all internal efforts, powering websites, mobile applications, and other systems. The awareness, logging, and other benefits can just as easily be applied to internal groups, helping understand how resources are used (or not used) across internal groups.</li>
<li><strong>Partner -&nbsp;</strong>After internal access to data resources, access levels can be crafted to support partner tiers of access, which might include access to special APIs, read and write capabilities, and relaxing of rate limits. These levels often include service level agreements, additional support options, as well as other benefits.</li>
<li><strong>Public</strong>&nbsp;- Data can be made publicly available using the web, while also maintaining the quality and security of the data, keep the access as frictionless as possible, while ensuring things stay up and running, and of expected quality and availability.</li>
<li><strong>Privacy -</strong>&nbsp;Even with publicly available data there is a lot to consider when it comes to the privacy of organizations, locations, and services involved, but also the logging, and tracking associated with platform operations.</li>
<li><strong>Transparency</strong>&nbsp;- One important characteristic of API platform is transparency in the API management layer, being public with the access tiers, resources available, and how a platform operates--without necessary transparency, consumers can become distrustful of the data.</li>
<li><strong>Licensing -&nbsp;</strong>Ideally all data and all schema in this scenario would be licensed as CC0, putting them into the public domain, but if there are license considerations, these requirements can be included along with each API response, as well as in platform documentation.</li>
<li><strong>Platform Meta API -</strong>&nbsp;APIs do not just provide access to the public data, they also provide access to the API management layer for the public data. Modern API management allows for API access to the platform in the several important ways:<br /> 
<ul>
<li><strong>Users</strong>&nbsp;- Providing API access to user's data and usage.</li>
<li><strong>Apps</strong>&nbsp;- Providing API access to applicaiton level data and usage.</li>
<li><strong>Tiers</strong>&nbsp;- Providing API access to platform tiers and details.</li>
<li><strong>Logs</strong>&nbsp;- Providing API access to the platform log files.</li>
<li><strong>Billing</strong>&nbsp;- Providing API access to the platform billing for access.</li>
<li><strong>Analytics</strong>&nbsp;- Providing API access to the analytics derived from logs, billing, and usage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Observability</strong>&nbsp;- An API management layer on top of public data makes data access observable, allowing platform operators, government agencies, and potentially 3rd party and independent auditors--observability will define both the control as well as access to vital public data resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>In a world that is increasingly defined by data, access to quality data is important&nbsp;and easy, secure access via the Internet is part of the DNA of public data in this world. API management provides a coherent way to define access to public data, adhering to the mandate that the data is accessible, while also striking a balance to ensure the quality, reliability, and completeness of the public data.</p>
<p>There has been a lot of promises made in the past about what open or public data can do by default&nbsp;when in reality opening up data is not a silver bullet for public services, and there is a lot more involved in successfully operating a sustained public data operation. APIs help ensure data resources are made available publicly, while also opening up some new revenue generation opportunities, helping ensure access is sustainable and continues to provide value--hopefully find a balance between public good and any sensible commercial aspirations that may exist.</p>
<p><strong>APIs Open Up Many Potential Applications That Support the Mission</strong><br />As doing business on the web became commonplace&nbsp;in the early 21st century, Amazon was realizing that they could enable the sales of their books and other products on the websites of their affiliate partners by using APIs. In 2016 there are many additional applications being developed on top of APIs, with delivering public data to multiple&nbsp;web sites being just the beginning.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Web</strong>&nbsp;- It is common for websites to pull from a database. Increasingly APIs are being used to drive not just a single website, but networks, and distributed websites that draw data and content from a variety of sources.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile</strong>&nbsp;- APIs are used to make data and content available across a variety of mobile applications, on different platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Embeddable</strong>&nbsp;- Delivering data to buttons, badges, bookmarklets, and widgets that can be embedded across a variety of websites, and applications.</li>
<li><strong>Conversational</strong>&nbsp;- Using data in conversational interfaces like for bots, messaging, and voice-enabled applications.</li>
<li><strong>Visualizations</strong>&nbsp;- Including data in visualizations, showing API consumption, and platform usage around public data.</li>
<li><strong>iPaaS / ETL -</strong>&nbsp;Enabling the migration of public data to and from other external 3rd party platforms using traditional ETL, or more modern iPaaS solutions powered via the API.</li>
<li><strong>Webhooks</strong>&nbsp;- Notifying external systems of relevant events (location or service update) by pushing to URLs via what is called a webhook.</li>
<li><strong>Spreadsheets -</strong>&nbsp;Publishing of data to Microsoft Excel or Google Spreadsheet using the public data APIs, as well as spreadsheet APIs.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just an overview of the number of ways in which a single, or multiple APIs can be used to deliver public data to many different endpoints, all in service of a single mission. When you consider this in support of public services, a bigger picture of how APIs and public data can be used to better serve the population--the first step always involved standardized, well-planned set of APIs being made available.</p>
<p><strong>The Monetization Requirements Around Public Data API Operations</strong><br />This is where we get to the&nbsp;portion of this discussion that is specifically about monetization of the operations around publishing and maintaining high-quality sources of public data. Before a sensible monetization strategy can be laid out, we need to be able to quantify what it costs to operate the platform&nbsp;and generate the expected value from everyone at the table.</p>
<p>What are the&nbsp;<span>hard costs that should be considered</span>&nbsp;when operating a public data platform and looking to establish some reasonable monetization objectives?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Acquisition</strong>&nbsp;- What one-time, and recurring costs are associated with acquiring data. This might include ongoing payouts to API contributors who are adding, updating, and validating data via the API.
<ul>
<li><strong>Discover&nbsp;</strong>- What was spent to discover data, and identify its use on the platform.</li>
<li><strong>Negotiate</strong>&nbsp;- What time to I have in actually getting access to something.</li>
<li><strong>Licensing&nbsp;</strong>- Are there licensing costs or fees involved in the acquisition&nbsp;of data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Development</strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;What one-time, and recurring costs are associated with platform development.
<ul>
<li><strong>Normalization</strong>&nbsp;- What does it take me to&nbsp;clean up, and normalize a&nbsp;data set, or across content. This is usually the&nbsp;busy janitorial work necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Validation</strong>&nbsp;- What is involved with validating that data is accurate correct, providing sources, and following up on references.</li>
<li><strong>Database</strong>&nbsp;- How much work is being put putting into setting up the database, maintaining, backing up, and delivering optimal levels of performance.</li>
<li><strong>Server</strong>&nbsp;- Defining the amount of work put into setting up, and configuring the server(s) to operate an API, including where it goes in the overall operations plan.</li>
<li><strong>Coding</strong>&nbsp;- How much work goes into actually coding an API. Ideally, open source frameworks are employed to reduce overhead, maintenance, and the resources needed to launch new endpoints.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Operational</strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;What one-time, and recurring costs are associated with platform development.
<ul>
<li><strong>Compute</strong>&nbsp;- What costs are associated with providing server&nbsp;compute&nbsp;capacity to process and deliver public data via APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Storage</strong>&nbsp;-What costs are associated with on the disk storage, for both the database and other images, video, and related objects.</li>
<li><strong>Network</strong>&nbsp;- How much bandwidth in / out is an API using to get the job done, as well as any other network overhead.</li>
<li><strong>Management</strong>&nbsp;- What percentage of API management resources is dedicated to the API. A flat percentage of API management overhead until usage history exists.</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring</strong>&nbsp;- What percentage of the API monitoring, testing, and performance service budget is dedicated to this API. How large is the&nbsp;surface area for monitoring?</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong>&nbsp;- What does it cost to secure a single API, as part of the larger overall operations? Does internal resource spend time, or is this a 3rd party service.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Understand The Value Being Generated By Public Data</strong><br />Now that we understand some of our hard costs, let's have an honest conversation about&nbsp;<span>what value is being generated</span>? First, public data has to offer value, or why are we doing all this hard work? Second, nobody is going to pay for anything if it doesn't offer any value. Let's stop for a moment and think about why we are doing all of this in the first place, and what value is worthy of carving off to drive&nbsp;monetization&nbsp;efforts.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Direct Value Generation -</strong>&nbsp;What direct value is being generated by the public data platform operations.
<ul>
<li><strong>Usage</strong>&nbsp;- How is usage wielded as part of value generation? Is value about the increased usage of a resource, or possible value generated by a minimum usage of a resource? Usage is an important dimension of determining how value is generated as part of API operations.</li>
<li><strong>Users</strong>&nbsp;- How is the value&nbsp;generated on a per user level?&nbsp;Are&nbsp;more users valuable? or&nbsp;possibly&nbsp;more targeted users? Teams, groups, and many other ways to determine how users impact positively or negatively the value generated from platform usage.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Relationships</strong>&nbsp;- How can relationships between users, or companies be applied to value generated? Will access to more relationships positively or negatively impact how value is generated for the platform and consumers?</li>
<li><strong>Data Acquisition&nbsp;</strong>- Is the acquisition of data part of the generation of value via the public data platform, encouraging the growth of data.</li>
<li><strong>Applications</strong>&nbsp;- Is value generated looked at on a per application basis? Does having multiple applications impact the value generate? Coming up with interesting ways to understand how applications impact platform value for everyone.</li>
<li><strong>Integrations</strong>&nbsp;- What external integrations are available? How can these be leveraged to enhance the value for consumers? Are some integrations part of base operations, where others are accessible at higher levels, or on a one-off basis.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Support</strong>&nbsp;- Is access to support something that impacts the value being generated? Does access to support resources introduce the optimal levels of value consumers are looking for? How is support wielded within overall platform&nbsp;monetization?</li>
<li>Service Level Agreements - Are we measuring the number of contracts signed, and partner agreements in place? And how we are delivering against those agreements?</li>
<li><strong>Revenue</strong>&nbsp;- What revenue opportunities for the ecosystem around an API and its operation, sharing in the money made from platform operations. Obviously, anything beyond operating costs should be applied to expansion of efforts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Indirect Value -&nbsp;</strong>What are some of the indirect value being generated by the public data platform operations.
<ul>
<li><strong>Marketing Vehicle</strong>&nbsp;- Having an API is cool these days, and some APIs are worth just having because of the PR value, and discussion.</li>
<li><strong>Traffic Generation</strong>&nbsp;- The API exists solely for distributing links to&nbsp;the web&nbsp;and mobile applications, driving traffic to specific properties - is this tracked as part of other analytics?</li>
<li><strong>Brand Awareness</strong>&nbsp;- Applying a brand strategy, and using the API to incentivize publishers to extend the reach of the brand and ultimately the platform - can we quantify this?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Analysis</strong>&nbsp;- How can analytics be leveraged as part of API value generation? Are analytics part of the base of operations, or are they an added value incentive for consumers, and platform operators.</li>
<li><strong>Competitiveness</strong>&nbsp;- Is the public data effort more agile, flexible, and competitive because it has an API and can deliver on new&nbsp;integrations, partnerships, and to new platforms easier, and more cost effectively?</li>
<li><strong>Public Service -</strong> Making data available for use on many different web, mobile, and other applications demonstrates a commitment to public service, and the good public data can do.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While there may be other hard costs associated, as well as areas of value being generated, this should provide a simple checklist that any open data provider can use as a starting blueprint. Additional costs can be included on in these existing&nbsp;areas&nbsp;or added on as new areas as deemed relevant--this is just about getting the monetization conversation going.</p>
<p>There are two main objectives in this exercise: 1) understanding the hard costs and value associated with operations 2) assembling into a coherent list so that we can explain to others as part of transparency efforts. When it comes to the business of public data, it is more than just generating revenue, it is about being upfront and honest about why we are doing this, and how it is done--mitigating the political risk involved with doing business with public resources out in the open.</p>
<p><strong>Putting Together A Working Plan Involving Public Data</strong><br />With an understanding of the hard costs of providing a public data platform&nbsp;and an awareness of the intended value to be generated via operations, we can now look at what details would be involved in a plan for executing this monetization strategy. API management practices are architected for metering, measuring, and limiting access to data, content, and algorithmic resources in service of a coherent, transparent public data monetization strategy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is a core framework of API management that can be applied to public data that can be used to drive monetization efforts:</p>

<p>These are the moving parts of a public data monetization strategy. It allows any public data resources to be made available on the web, enabling self-service access to data 24/7. However, it does it in a way that requires accountability by ALL consumers, whether they are internal, partner, or the public at large. This API management scaffolding allows for the frictionless access to public data resources by the users and applications that are identified as worthwhile, and imposing limits, and fees for higher volume and commercial levels of access.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Speaking To A Wide Audience With This Public Data Monetization Research</strong><br />I purposely wrote this document to speak to as wide as possible audience as possible. In my experience working with public data across numerous different industries, there can be a wide variety of actors involved in the public data stewardship pipeline. My objective is to get more public data accessible via web APIs, and generating revenue to help fund this is one of my biggest concerns. I am not looking to incentivize people in making unwarranted profits on top of public data, this is already going on. My goal is open up the silos of public data out there right now, make them more accessible, while opening up the opportunity for delivering to a variety of applications, while also funding this important process.</p>
<p>I wanted to help anyone reading this to craft a coherent argument for generating much-needed revenue from public data, whether they are trying to convince a government agency, non-profit organization, institution, or a commercial company. Public data needs to be available in a machine-readable way for use in a variety of applications in 2016--something that takes resources and collaboration. APIs are not another vendor solution, they are the next step in the evolution of the web, where we don't just make data available for humans by publishing as HTML--we need the raw data available for use in many different applications.&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">03 Jan 2017</span>
        <p><a href="http://algorithmic.rotoscope.work"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/algorotoscope/valleyrivertreeline/clean_view/file-00_01_06_83.jpg" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I was playing around with <a href="https://algorithmia.com">Algorithmia</a> for a story about their business model back in December, when I got sucked into playing with their <a href="https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/deeplearning/DeepFilter">DeepFilter service</a>, resulting in a 4-week long distraction which ultimately became what I am calling my&nbsp;<a href="http://algorithmic.rotoscope.work">algorithmic rotoscope</a>&nbsp;work. After weeks of playing around, I have a good grasp of what it takes to separate videos into individual images, applying the&nbsp;Algorithmia&nbsp;machine learning filters, and reassembling them as videos. I also have several of my own texture filters created now using <a href="http://blog.algorithmia.com/training-style-transfer-models/">the AWS AMI and process provided&nbsp;Algorithmia</a>--you can <a href="http://algorithmic.rotoscope.work/updates/">learn more about algorithmic rotoscope, and details of what I did via the Github project updates</a>e.</p>
<p>The project has been a great distraction from what I should be doing. After the election, I just did not feel like doing my regular writing, scheduling of Tweets, processing of press releases, and the other things I do on a regular basis. Algorithmic Rotoscope provided a creative, yet a&nbsp;still very API focused project to take my mind off things during the holidays. It was a concept I couldn't get out of my head, which is always a sign for me that I should be working on a project. The work was more involved than I anticipated, but after a couple weeks of tinkering, I have the core process for applying filters to videos working well, allowing me to easily apply the algorithmic textures.</p>
<p>Other than just being a distraction, this project has been a great learning experience for me,&nbsp;with several aspects keeping me engaged:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/deeplearning/DeepFilter">Algorithmia's Image Filters</a>&nbsp;</strong> - Their very cool DeepFilter service, which allows you to apply artistically and stylish filters to your images using their API or CLI, providing over 30 filters you can use right away.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://blog.algorithmia.com/training-style-transfer-models/?ref=demo">Training Style Transfer Models</a> -</strong> Firing up an Amazon GPU instance, look through art books and find interesting pieces that can be used to train the machine learning models, so you can define your own filters.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://image.rotoscope.work/">Applying Filters To Images</a></strong> - I spent hours playing with Algorithmia's filters, applying to my photo library, experimenting, and playing around with what looks good, and what is possible.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://algorithmic.rotoscope.work/">Applying Filters To Videos</a></strong> - Applying Algorithmia's, and my own filters video I have laying around, especially what is possible when applied to the GB's of drone video I have laying around, something that is only going to grow.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why is this an API story? Well, first of all, it uses the Algorithmia API, but I also developed the separation of the videos, applying filters to images, and reassembling the videos as an API. It isn't anything that is production stable, but I've processed thousands of images, many minutes of video, and made over 100K API calls to Algorithmia. Next, I am going to write-up Algorithmia's business model, using my algorithmic rotoscope work as a hypothetical API-driven business--helping me think through the economics of building a SaaS or retail API solution on top of Algorithmia.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond being an API story, it has been a lot of fun to engineer, and play with. I still have a GPU instance fired up, training filters, as well as recording more drone and other video footage specifically so I can apply some of the new filters I've produced. I have no intention of doing it as a business. algorithmic rotoscope is just a side project, that I hope will continue to be a creative distraction for me, and give me another reason to keep flying drones, and getting away from the computer when I can. In the end I am learning a lot about drones, videography, and machine learning, but the best of all it has helped me regain my writing mojo--with this being the first post I've written on API Evangelist since LAST YEAR! ;-)</p>

        <span class="post-date">03 Jan 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/algorithmia_pricing.png" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I got sucked into <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/01/03/learning-about-machine-learning-apis-with-my-algorithmic-rotoscope-work/">a month long project applying machine learning filters to video over the holidays</a>. The project began with me doing the research on the economics behind Algorithmia's machine learning services, specifically <a href="https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/deeplearning/DeepFilter">the DeepFilter algorithm in their catalog</a>. My <a href="http://algorithmic.rotoscope.work">algorithmic rotoscope</a> work applying Algorithmia's Deep Filters to images and drone videos has given me a hands-on&nbsp;view of Algorithmia's approach to algorithms, and APIs, and the opportunity to think pretty deeply about the economics of all of this. I think Algorithmia's vision of all of this has a lot of potential for not just image filters, but any sort of algorithmic and machine learning API.</p>
<p><strong>Retail Algorithmic and Machine Learning APIs</strong><br />Using <a href="http://algorithmia.io">Algorithmia</a> is pretty straightforward. With their API or CLI you can make calls to a variety of algorithms in their catalog, in this case<a href="https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/deeplearning/DeepFilter"> their DeepFilter solution</a>. All I do is pass them the URL of an image, what I want the new filtered image to be called, and the name of the filter that I want to be applied. Algorithmia provides an API explorer you can copy &amp; paste the required JSON into, or they also provide a demo application for you to use--no JSON required.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Training Your Own Style Transfer Models Using Their AWS AMI</strong><br />The first "rabbit hole" concept I fell into when doing the research on Algorithmia's model was <a href="/admin/blog/blog.algorithmia.com/training-style-transfer-models/">their story on creating your own style transfer models</a>, providing you step by step details on how to train them, including a ready to go AWS AMI that you can run as a GPU instance. At first, I thought they were just cannibalizing their own service, but then I realized it was much more savvier than that. They were offloading much of the costly compute resources needed to create the models, but the end product still resulted in using their Deep Filter APIs.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Developing My Own API Layer For Working With Images and Videos</strong><br />Once I had experience using Algorithmia's deep filter via their API, and had produced a handful of my own style transfer models, I got to work designing my own process for uploading and applying the filters to images, then eventually separating out videos into individual images, applying the filters, then reassembling them into videos. The entire process, start to finish is a set of APIs, with a couple of them simply acting as a facade for Algorithmia's file upload, download, and DeepFilter APIs. It provided me with a perfect hypothetical business for thinking through the economics of building on top of Algorithmia's platform.</p>
<p><a href="https://algorithmia.com/pricing"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/algorithmia_pricing_how_it_works.png" alt="" width="75%" align="center" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Defining My Hard Costs of Algorithmia's Service and the AWS Compute Needed</strong><br />Algorithmia provides <a href="https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/deeplearning/DeepFilter">a pricing calculator along with each of their algorithms</a>, allowing you to easily predict your costs. They charge you per API call, and the compute usage by the second. Each API has its own calculator, and average runtime duration costs, so I'm easily able to calculate a per image cost to apply filters--something that exponentially grows when you are applying to 60 frames (images) per second of video. Similarly, when it comes to training filter models using AWS EC2 GUP instance, I have a per hour charge for compute, storage costs, and (now) a pretty good idea of how many hours it takes to make a single filter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of this gives me some pretty solid numbers to work with when trying to build a viable business built on top of Algorithmia. In theory, when my customers use my algorithmic rotoscope image or video interface, as well as the API, I can cover my operating costs, and generate a healthy profit by charging a per image cost for applying a machine learning texture filter. What I really think is innovative about Algorithmia's approach is that they are providing an AWS AMI to offload much of the "heavy compute lifting", with all roads still leading back to using their service. It is a model that could quickly shift algorithmic API consumers to be more wholesale / volume consumers, from being just a retail level API consumer.</p>
<p>My example of this focuses on images and video, but this model can be applied to any type of algorithmically fueled APIs. It provides me with a model of how you can safely open source the process behind your algorithms as AWS AMI and actually drive more business to your APIs by evolving your API consumers into wholesale API consumers. In my experience, many API providers are very concerned with malicious users reverse engineering their algorithms via their APIs, when in reality, in true API fashion, there are ways you can actually open up your algorithms, make them more accessible, and deployable, while still helping contribute significantly to your bottom line.</p>

<p>I am reworking the API Evangelist developer area, and shifting most of my content to be available as YAML and JSON data on the Github repositories that drive my network of sites. I'm doing this partly because I am not in the business of managing and growing an API community, and because there are some really badly behaved people out there that I'm just not really interested in having keys to my internal network. I am happy to open up read only access to my work publicly and write capabilities to my trusted partners, but having self-service access to my server(s) just isn't fun in the current online climate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I get it when folks want to keep their valuable data, content, and algorithm under lock and key, and require developers to build a relationship before they get access&nbsp;or increased levels of consumption. However, this hasn't always been the tune I'm whistling. There are plenty of examples of me telling API providers to provide self-service access to their resources in the past--well, we've fucked that off, with our bad behavior as API consumers. It's not that the concept won't work, it is just that it won't work with the number of assholes on the web these days it just isn't a good idea.</p>
<p>Even with keeping the lock and key on our API resources, we can still be public with our API operations--there are many positive reasons for doing so. SEO is probably the first, I mean how are people going to find your APIs if you can't Google for them. Providing information to the press, and making the resources that support your APIs self-service can reduce&nbsp;the workload when you do give people access. Some examples of this can be found when looking at the <a href="https://developer.target.com/">Target</a> vs. <a href="https://developer.pandora.com/">Pandora</a> developer programs, both required approval to get access, but <a href="https://developer.target.com/">Target</a> is much more open than <a href="https://developer.pandora.com/">Pandora</a> with their overall story.</p>
<p>Target really doesn't have that much more than Pandora does, but they have a blog and link to their Github, and of course their jobs page. I'm still going to publish the documentation for my own APIs, and go further than Target has, but I have to give them credit for being at least a little more creative, and public than Pandora. Like I said I won't be pushing back on providers when they do not have self-service public access to their API resources anymore, but I will be encouraging y'all to be creative when thinking about the public presence of your operations and engaging in some meaningful storytelling via a publicly available portal.</p>

<p>Talking to people, and telling stories on a regular basis always pushes me to evolve my understanding of how people see (or don't see) APIs, and pushes me to keep shifting the way I tell stories. I've always felt that that education about APIs should be relevant to the users, but usually this centers around making it familiar,&nbsp;and speak to whoever I am helping onboard. After talking to some folks recently at <a href="https://twitter.com/apistrat">@APIStrat</a>, I'm adding to my thinking on this, and focusing on making my stories more precise for folks I talk with.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I really like APIs is that they are so versatile. You can take and a piece of data, content, or an algorithm (code), and wrap with an API, and provide read and write access via the Internet. However, I think the average person does not thrive in this environment and need an explanation that is more precise. It doesn't help them to know that APIs can do anything, they need it to be relevant, but also providing a single solution that they can wrap their heads around, and apply in their world.</p>
<p>I am just sharing this thinking as I'm working to add it to my storytelling toolbox. I'm really committed to helping people understand what APIs are, so they can help push back on platforms to have APIs, as well as be more open with existing APIs. It doesn't do any good to confuse people with an unlimited number of API scenarios. We should be dialing in our storytelling so that we can help onboard them with the concept, and increase the number of folks who understand that they can take control over their own information on the platforms they depend on each day.</p>

<p>My friend and partner in crime Nicolas Greni&eacute; (<a href="https://twitter.com/picsoung">@picsoung</a>), and operator of our <a href="http://apis.io/">open source API search engine APIs.io</a>, just let me know that <a href="http://data.gov.tw/apis.json">the Taiwanese government just added an APIs.json&nbsp;file for their government open data site</a>. Adding to the other authoritative (added by owner) <a href="http://developer.trade.gov/apis.json">government API indexes like from Trade.gov in the United States</a>.</p>
<p>We haven't' had a lot of time to move forward the APIs.json&nbsp;index lately, but honestly it doesn't need much pushing forward at this point in time. Our primary objective is to continue getting adoption like this, and not radically shift the specification until we have more feedback from the community, across a large number of API operators.</p>
<p>You can learn more about <a href="http://apisjson.org/">the specification we've been working on over at apisjson.org</a>, and see other existing implements from Fibit, Plivo, and Actuity&nbsp;Scheduling. Once you've created an APIs.json&nbsp;definition for your API operations you can add to <a href="http://apis.io/">the APIs.io search engine</a> using the <a href="http://apis.io/apis/add">submission form</a>, or <a href="http://apis.io/apiDoc">using the APIs.io API</a>.

<p>I tried to get back to normal last week on API Evangelist -- I failed. The previous week was @APIStrat in Boston, which was a success. It was the Presidential election that caused me to swerve and put things into the ditch. I was devastated and saddened by the results. Not because my party lost, but because we chose someone who ran on such a racially, and religiously&nbsp;charged platform, that was so threatening to women.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is easy to mistake what I do as the API Evangelist, as being a voice for the startup community -- cheerleading APIs in the service of the seemingly&nbsp;endless wave of tech companies coming out of Silicon Valley. While I do pay attention to the technology, and business of how these companies are using APIs, making sure the content, data, and algorithms they employ are transparent and observable by partners, 3rd party developers, end-users, and industry regulators is my primary objective.</p>
<p>My mission is not about open APIs because open always makes things better, or simply open for business. I believe corporate, government and institutional data, content, and algorithmic resources should be as transparent and observable as possible, by those who are impacted by their existence. Meaning if you are collecting data about me, I should know what you are collecting, and have access to it. I should be able to move it around or delete it. Trusted regulators and auditors should also be able to peek behind the curtains of the algorithms that are increasingly impacting our world, and make sure they size up with the claims being made.</p>
<p>I have spent six years pushing on startups and the enterprise to be more transparent and inclusive with their resources by employing APIs. During this time I did the same for the city, state, and the federal government. I've also extended this to higher educational institutions. With Donald Trump in office, this does not change, it just ups the stakes for me. In this climate, being transparent about the data we collect and share, and how the algorithms operate will only be more critical.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am nervous about the future. Much of the existing rhetoric around algorithms&nbsp;and the surveillance&nbsp;economy has worried me, but all of this in the hands of a sexist, racist, and Islamophobically charged administration and climate scare the hell out of me. In 2017 I will continue to cover the technology and business of APIs, but as I have already been&nbsp;doing, I will be spending a larger portion of my time talking about <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/03/17/politics-of-apis/">the politics of APIs</a>, including terms of service, privacy, and the observability of the systems and algorithms that are fueling our increasingly Internet-connected world.

        <p><a href="http://stoplight.io/platform/scenarios/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/stoplight_scenarios.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>There aren't too many startups doing interesting things in the API space right now. One of the exceptions is <a href="http://stoplight.io">Stoplight.io</a>. I am working really hard to find some of the good things in the API space to focus on, in hopes of not being too dark with my writing, after the election. <a href="http://stoplight.io/platform/scenarios/">Stoplight's new Scenarios</a> is something new, something progressive, and I think could have a larger impact down the road--making it worth covering here on API Evangelist.</p>
<p>Stoplight Scenarios is billed as "Test, automate, and debug web APIs + AWS Lambda". You can make API and AWS Lambda calls, and test, automate, and debug the responses -- pretty standard stuff we are seeing across several API service providers. Where it gets interesting for me is that you can daisy chain these requests together into a variety of scenarios. You can do this with a single API, or you can do it across a variety of disparate APIs--making for some pretty valuable "juju" in my opinion.</p>
<p>As I am learning about a new API, I am often frustrated by having to connect the dots between many different paths, adding, then pulling, then updating, and other common "scenarios" I will want to accomplish. I would love for API providers to do this heavy lifting for me, and provide me with a variety of the common scenarios I need as an API consumer to get up and going. This is just the local possibilities around using scenarios, I'll explore the possibilities between many distributed APIs in future posts.</p>
<p>If you haven't played with <a href="http://stoplight.io">Stoplight</a> before, I recommend heading over there. Their API design, definition, mocking, and documentation tooling is leading edge stuff in the world of APIs right now. The <a href="http://stoplight.io/platform/scenarios/">Stoplight Scenarios</a> just ups the value their platform brings to the table, continuing to make them on of the few bright spots in the API world for me these days. Let me know what you think after you play with more.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/steve_and_i_apistrat_2016.jpg" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="http://boston2016.apistrat.com/">The 7th edition of API Strategy &amp; Practice wrapped up last week</a>. It has been difficult to gather my thoughts with the election going on, but I wanted to shift my attention back to the API community for a bit. Steve Willmott and I started APIStrat back in 2012 to help establish an open, vendor-neutral community to discuss the technology, business, and politics of APIs -- we more than succeeded!</p>
<p>It always warms my heart when people come up to me and share that they didn't see anything different about APIStrat, from other events before they attended&nbsp;and that they do now. Steve and I worked our asses off to make it a rich, inclusive, and meaningful conversation around APIs. It makes me very happy to hear people seeing the event as we intended, and going home with a headful of API knowledge.</p>
<p>One thing I heard from several of the core members who have been there since the first one, and is something that has lingered in my mind, not just because of APIStrat, but also because of where are at in the wider API space -- is that the API world is expanding, and there are concerns regarding how we can maintain community. I consider our hard work in evangelizing APIs to be a success, as space is expanding like never before. Everybody is doing APIs, it isn't just a niche anymore. We are at the point we were with the web in 2001, and folks aren't asking if they should be doing APIs anymore--they are just doing them.</p>
<p>Many of us in the original group are tired. We've been at this for a while. Many of the younger ones are still easily excited and distracted by new technology. There are many new entrants who just need to hear the same old stories we've been telling for years so that they can just get up to speed. Many people expressed their concerns around maintaining community in the face of this evolution, and growth in the space. It leaves a pretty big smile on my face that we are having trouble scaling the API community -- maybe we should try micro-communities or a dev ops approach...no, no a containerized API community! ;-)</p>
<p>I don't know the answer. I'm confident we will find a way forward. I'm super thankful for the community we've built. It literally saved my ass this summer. I just wanted to put these thoughts out there, and let folks know I heard, and Steve and I care.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://boston2016.apistrat.com/">7th edition of API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference</a> happened last week. While I wasn't fully engaged throughout the planning process for this edition, due to my summer being disrupted, I wanted to take the time to share some of what happened to make it more of an inclusive technology event. There is a lot of people who are "interested" in making their events more diverse and inclusive, but APIStrat is "committed" to this (thanks, Charles Ashley III <a href="https://twitter.com/CAsh_The3rd">@CAsh_The3rd</a>), and here are some of what we did.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strong Female Lead - </strong>Put a woman in charge. Period. She will set a good tone.</li>
<li><strong>Invite Women To Speak -</strong> Work to ONLY invite women when getting started.</li>
<li><strong>Invite People of Color To Speak </strong>- Work to ONLY invite people of color when getting started.</li>
<li><strong>Have Code Of Conduct - </strong>Make there is a code of conduct present, and communicated well.</li>
<li><strong>Enforce Code of Conduct -</strong> Sadly, we had to do&nbsp;this&nbsp;round, but it sets the right tone.</li>
<li><strong>No </strong>Manels<strong> -</strong> Do not have any panels where you only have men.</li>
<li><strong>Numbers</strong>&nbsp;- Know your numbers, and work every moment to increase them wherever you can.</li>
<li><strong>Repeat, Rinse -</strong> Repeat all of this at all levels, session chairs, keynotes, reg counter, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nowhere near where we want to be</span> with making #APIStrat a truly inclusive event, but we are making improvements with each edition. We have our checklist and have been building on it with each event. It takes a leadership team that is committed to this. Steve, Lorinda, Amelia, and the team delivered this round -- I wish I could take credit. I saw more women, diverse faces, and topics at #APIStrat this round -- leaving me very, please.</p>
<p>If you are running a tech conference, please put in the extra work. You can't just give this 5 or 10% effort. You literally have to invite NO WHITE MEN to your event for the first couple of waves of outreach. You need to do some serious homework on the women and people of color who are making an impact across the space. If you do the work, set the right tone, it will go far beyond just being able to pat yourself on the back--the ideas and conversations will be richer for it.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Nov 2016</span>
        <p><strong>Difficult To Keep My Attention<br /></strong>When I was young I was always curious when it came to technology. I set up the entire computer lab for my 7th-grade math teacher back in 1983. I programmed computers all through high school, even having a job programming the software used by schools in the State of Oregon in COBOL. I was really good at&nbsp;school&nbsp;until I wasn't interested. If I got bored, which I did growing up in rural Oregon, I tended not to pay&nbsp;attention&nbsp;in school. Eventually, it got kicked out of high school in my senior year, and I ended up getting into drugs, and a lot of trouble. From 1990 through 1995 I spent my time traveling the country partying and dealing drugs until I finally hit a wall and needed a way out. To get my life out of the ditch I turned to what I already knew, the outdoors (I grew up out in the woods), and computers. I was good at paying&nbsp;attention&nbsp;to the bits and bytes in the emerging world of personal computing, and I would leverage technology to get me out of this mess I found myself in.</p>

<p><strong>Attention To Family &amp; Career</strong><br />After spending a summer in the Oregon wilderness getting clean and healthy, I moved to the nearest city&nbsp;and got to work building a career. By the first&nbsp;dot com bubble, I had found success, married a young lady, and had a beautiful baby girl. I had left my troubled past behind. It was a period in my life where there the harder I worked, the better I felt. I had a good&nbsp;job and bought a house (two), but my attention always seemed to be on finding further business success, a sort&nbsp;of chronic entrepreneurial condition,&nbsp;resulting in having at least one, and often times multiple startup projects going on at any point in time. In total, I had almost 14 separate startups with only two I can even remotely consider a success. Maybe I was too early? Maybe I was just paying attention to the wrong details, and ignoring what mattered to people around me--most critically, to my now ex-wife.</p>

<p><strong>Attention To My New Partner In Crime</strong><br />In 2009, after putting my startup ambitions behind me, and moving on with my life after a divorce, I met an amazing lady. She had a teenage son, and I had a tween daughter. She worked in education technology, and I worked in tech. What we were paying attention to seemed to be compatible. After we connected she increased her focus&nbsp;on the world of educational technology and encouraged me to increase my focus to&nbsp;something that mattered to me. I got to work exploring what that would be--at the&nbsp;time I was finding success using this new thing called the "cloud". I knew it was going to be significant in the future, but I also knew there was more to it, beyond just things being in the "cloud".</p>

<p><strong>Attention To The Business of APIs</strong><br />I saw the commercial potential of making digital resources like compute and storage available in the cloud using APIs&nbsp;and increasingly saw entrepreneurs deliver the resources needed for mobile application development using APIs. What did both cloud and mobile have in common? APIs! This is where I would pay attention. As I dug deeper, I noticed there were a number folks paying attention to the technical merits of web APIs, aka REST, but that very few people were paying attention to the business side of API operations. I was watching companies like Twilio, SendGrid, Stripe, and others demonstrate that there was more to this API thing than just having a RESTful API on the open web, and that through sensible identity and access management (API keys, OAuth), rate limiting, metrics and reporting, aka API service composition, that you could develop some pretty interesting business models. I felt I had hit on something significant, and would focus all my attention on the business of APIs.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Attention To Bankruptcy &amp; Addiction</strong><br />Things were going reasonably well. I was paying attention to the fast growing world of APIs. The only problem was that I&nbsp;hadn't&nbsp;been paying attention to the finances as much as I probably should have, and my previous&nbsp;startups and my divorce were finally catching up with me. I had nowhere else to go, I had to declare bankruptcy. Around the same&nbsp;time, my partner's son began to have problems in his world, involving depression, and pharmaceutical addiction. He needed some assistance. We tried a change of scenery, moving him to another city in another state, hoping to shift his attention to a new environment, and job. At this point in our&nbsp;career, we were living 100% on the road, traveling to events, evangelizing APIs and education technology, but we did what we could to help him find some balance.</p>

<p><strong>Attention To The Politics of APIs</strong><br />My hard work paying attention to the world of APIs was paying off. I was acquiring new partners, sponsors, and tackling more projects that were focused on the business of&nbsp;APIs, telling the stories of how startups were making an impact across a variety business sector. As I paid more attention to the&nbsp;business of APIs I began to see there was more to APIs, and that things like terms of service, copyright, service level agreements, security, and even regulation were beginning to define the space. My work ended up getting me invited to work at the White House, helping out the Obama team with open data and API strategy across the federal government, and helping the Electronic Frontier Foundation with the Oracle v Google API copyright case. I was still paying very much paying attention to the business of APIs, but increasingly I was also paying more attention to what I had come to call the politics of APIs.</p>

<p><strong>Attending To My Health &amp; Well Being</strong><br />It can easy to get caught up in work, especially when you are an API Evangelist. It can also become a distraction from your actual life, and the material world around you. API Evangelist was a character for me, a persona, but I was living on the road, spending every waking moment as this character--resulting in me paying attention to very little else. During this time I was present, front and center in the API space, but I was neglecting to pay&nbsp;attention to my own health, something that finally caught up with me. Because of the Affordable Care Act (thanks, Obama!) I went to the doctor early this year, and he said that I would not live beyond 50 if I didn't stop drinking alcohol. I quit drinking immediately. Then shortly after&nbsp;this happened, my partner's son showed up on our doorstep. He had been kicked out of the treatment center we had placed him in 8 months earlier, after a continued struggle with his depression and addiction. I was sober. He was using opiates again. We had no money. What could we do?</p>

<p><strong>Attention In A Material World<br /></strong>I did the only thing I knew how to do. I did what I had done before and headed up to the woods to get clean. We rented a truck and drove to Yosemite, and deep into the Sierra Nevada mountains of California. We found ourselves on Peterson Mountain on the border of California and Nevada digging for quartz crystals (another place from my past), after which we would make our way north through North California, and on into Oregon. We avoided cities, and spend our days hiking and clearing trails. We put signs back up. We often were paying attention to trails that seemed forgotten by humans&nbsp;and were just melting back into nature. We rock hopped in rivers and creeks. Swam in the snow melt. We walked 10-15 miles most days, paying attention to the kid's health, and as I would learn--my own health and sanity along the way. We talked&nbsp;about getting high, the online world, having oxycontin delivered to your door enabled by the Fedex API, being paid for with help from the Bitcoin API. Convenience and online culture. We walked. We walked. We walked. We walked until we slept each day.</p>

<p><strong>Attention To The Digital World</strong><br />While I was marching the kid around the mountains, it was an emotionally and physically exhausting time for both us, and through all of&nbsp;this&nbsp;I didn't want to neglect (our) more digital selves. The kid is your average 20 something who spends much of his time online, and gaming. While out in the wilderness I wanted to&nbsp;still attend to the digital parts of his (our)&nbsp;personality&nbsp;and I settled in on drones as a viable distraction. Drones worked. We could fly them on the trail, capture video, and as I would come to learn, we could also pay attention to much more around us using this new and wonderful Internet and radio connected device. We chose the DJI Phantom 3 Pro drone which has an iPad as the visual experience for the radio controller. Something that when you put in the&nbsp;kid's&nbsp;hands he'd head into a bush, under a rock overhang, and focus 100% of his attention to flying and experiencing the world through the drone's camera. Contrasting his approach, when you put the controller in my hand, I would always keep one eye&nbsp;towards the sky, paying attention to this very expensive, physical object flying through the canyons, over the lakes, and down the river.</p>

<p><strong>Attention At The Intersection Of Physical &amp; Virtual</strong><br />Drones are an amazing piece of tech. They give you an entirely new view of the world. It is a 4K&nbsp;video of the world wrapped in longitude, latitude, altitude, airspeed, and a wealth of other data. The physical drone has its own APIs. The guidance systems have APIs. The camera has its own APIs. The battery has its own APIs. The radio controller has its own APIs. The mobile interface for the controller has its own APIs. It uses APIs to acquire GPS and mapping information. When a wireless network is present it can stream live to Youtube and Facebook using APIs. It receives updates in the controller app regarding nearby airports, military bases, weather, and forest fires using APIs. Data is captured every second when operating&nbsp;and can be uploaded to the cloud synchronously or asynchronously using APIs. It is an amazing Internet of Things (IoT) device to consider when it comes to API usage, as well as just for flying through mountain meadows, and through river canyons.</p>

<p><strong>The Digitial Demanding Our Attention</strong><br />This summer we were able to successfully escape out into the woods, at the tops of mountains, and down into the deep river valleys. However, even though we were often hundreds of miles into the wilderness, the&nbsp;digital world seemed to seek us out. The battery would need a firmware upgrade. The controller was out of sync guidance firmware. Where is the damn cell phone charging cable? The batteries (with firmware)--were they warm enough to operate? When we'd get to the end of trails, and I would grab a cell phone to call for a ride, or communicate that we were safe, the cell service was so bad, we'd wait for hours sometimes for push notifications, alerts, syncs, and other digital noise to complete before we could gather enough bandwidth to send a simple SMS. We eventually learned to remove all but the essential applications, so the demands for our attention were reduced to only what we needed to survive and get from point A to B, and to acquire supplies.</p>

<p><strong>Attending To My Online World</strong><br />As we approached 3 months in the woods, it was time to come back. The kid settled into an apartment in Portland &nbsp;OR, and I went back to Los&nbsp;Angeles, CA. I turned on all the regular channels, my feeds, email, Github, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Medium, Slack, Disqus, Reddit, DZone, Lanyrd, Meetup, Stack Overflow, SoundCloud, Tumblr, and others. Everything was demanding my attention. Read Me! We want to work with you! Our tech is the next thing! Come speak at our event! This is the next big thing! By 2020 everyone will be doing this! I realized how much I had been paying attention to, how much momentum I had built up. I realized how much of an API driven assault I was under each day. Now I needed to understand what was actually worthy of my attention, bend the concept of real time to my personal definition, and establish a sort of&nbsp;"air gap" between me and the digital world that had an unending appetite for my attention.</p>

<p><strong>Attention On The Drone</strong><br />Even back in the real world, the drone continued to linger in my mind, working to get my attention. I was learning more about the device and it's APIs, and how it consumed APIs in the cloud, and how it used&nbsp;APIs to publish video, images, and other data to the clouds. I learned about how companies like&nbsp;Airmap&nbsp;were providing updates to my DJI drones from federal government agencies like the&nbsp;Department&nbsp;of Interior. I also learned how these agencies had themselves discovered that their fleets of DJI drones were updating video, images, and all this data to Chinese servers. DOH! Drones seemed to be capturing everybody's attention, as they&nbsp;interfered&nbsp;with forest fires, flew in front of commercial airlines, and gave us a new perspective of our both the material and digital worlds. Providing us with an entirely new way to gather data, develop&nbsp;awareness, and pay attention to infrastructure, nature, or even a police protest. Drones are capturing our attention, but it also feels like they were now also paying attention to us, whether we like it or not.</p>

<p><strong>Attending To What Matters</strong><br />I consider myself a success. I do what I enjoy for a living, and make more than enough money to survive. I have an amazing partner in crime. I have a strong and smart teenage&nbsp;daughter. None of this success is&nbsp;due to any single event along the way. My success is because I always realized that all if this is a&nbsp;journey&nbsp;and never a single&nbsp;destination. It is not the money. It is not about a lack of money. Not any single piece technology. Not about any of the startups I have helped build&nbsp;or worked with. Not even API Evangelist. APIs simple have given me lens to look through as I pay attention to the "seemingly fast-paced" world of&nbsp;web, mobile, and now these amazing devices we are connecting to the web. No single piece of technology is what truly matters, not even the API, it all depends on what I do with them, and how we empower (or hurt) humans with them. This is a human story. This is my story. It is not a technology story. It is my personal journey. The technology is just one of the tools in my toolbox. The usefulness&nbsp;of my tools depends on which ones I choose to use (or not), how I care for them, and the knowledge behind how I put these tools to work. Taking a moment with each application, to always consider what really matters.</p>

<p><strong>Definition Of Attention<br /></strong>To close I wanted to borrow from my partner in crime Audrey Watters (@audreywatters) on talk a couple of months ago on attention, where she said: According to the OED, &ldquo;attention&rdquo; &ndash; derived from the Latin &ldquo;<em>attendere</em>,&rdquo; to attend &ndash; means &ldquo;The action, fact, or state of attending or giving heed;&nbsp;earnest&nbsp;direction of the mind, consideration, or regard; especially in the phrase&nbsp;<em>to pay or give attention</em>. The mental power or faculty of attending; especially with&nbsp;<em>attract, call, draw, arrest, fix</em>, etc.&rdquo; &ldquo;Attention&rdquo; is a noun, but it refers to an action and/or a state of being. Attention is a mental activity. An earnest activity &ndash; which I particularly like. Attention is a military activity. It refers to how we stand and how we see and how we think.</p>

<p>I was reading the <a href="https://transparency.yahoo.com/">latest Yahoo transparency report</a>, as well as the <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/transparency">Tumblr</a>. When a company releases their latest version of this data, it tends to prompt me to take a look at some of the other providers who have them, like <a href="https://www.google.com/transparencyreport/">Google</a> and <a href="https://transparency.twitter.com/">Twitter</a>. I am interested in what I can learn from these reports, about what the government is up to, as well as the incentives behind each platform publishing their reports. I fascinated by studying the process and approach of each company, tracking on what some of the common building blocks so that I can include in <a href="http://transparency.apievangelist.com">my API transparency research</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://transparency.twitter.com/en/information-requests.html">addition of CSV downloads of information requests by Twitter</a> is worth noting, and adding to my list of building blocks. Platform providers are going to have to consider adding machine-readable versions of their transparency reports to help address the growing number of requests they will bet getting in this area. Providing CSV, JSON, or even YAML access to transparency report information is going to become important for us to understand how this legal and very political layer of our worlds is evolving.</p>

<p>The number of government and court requests for information are up. The number of companies publishing transparency reports in response to public demand for transparency is increasing. Providing machine readable representations of this data, as well as evolving a common API and data schema definition is the only way we are going to be able to manage this growth, and make sense of the data across platform providers. <a href="http://transparency.apievangelist.com/">I will keep adding company transparency reports to my research</a>, and take the time to aggregate the common elements in play across them, and see if I can't contribute to this common API and schema definition for use by providers</p>

<p>I went down to the police department in Hermosa Beach and filed my application for a drone permit. It's been two weeks and I haven't heard back. When I get done with <a href="https://twitter.com/apistrat">@APIStrat</a> I will go down there and talk to them again, and probably have to resubmit my application. Hermosa Beach is purported to have some of the strictest laws. I'm submitting mine so I can just play with my drone, and program it on the beach without getting into trouble.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before I fly my drone <a href="http://www.faa.gov/uas/where_to_fly/b4ufly/">I use the B4UFLY mobile app from the Federal Aviation Administration</a> to know whether I should fly my drone or not. It tells me whether I'm near an airport, military base, other location or event. This helps, but it doesn't help me with the legal side of things, what the laws are in my area, and any assistance in acquiring permits and approval. The industry is young, I'm sure eager startups out there are already working their asses off to aggregate the data, and serving it up via APIs for use in mobile and drone applications.</p>
<p>As an operator, I am going to need the laws applying to the drone, bu also laws applying to video, and other data gathered. Can I be filming? What are private / public property data and privacy laws? I am gathering video, weather, temperature, and other crop data over commercial farms, am I allowed to keep it? What are the rules with other types of imaging&nbsp;like infrared? Are there any noise ordinances? There are numerous considerations when flying a drone for both personal and commercial scenarios.</p>
<p>To be an informed pilot I need all this at run(flight)time. I guess I might also need some of it before I head out to my flight location, but also whatever I can also get at flight time. The drone sector seems to begin the process of tackling many of the urgent questions facing the industry.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.faa.gov/uas/">The FAA has stepped up with their guidance</a>, and companies like <a href="https://www.airmap.com/">Airmap</a> are also getting involved with the flight restriction level, as well as weather. We will need the same layer&nbsp;for the legal side of things, helping us receive up to date details on the laws impacting me flying drones, filming, and gathering data--maybe systems to help us manage.</p>
<p>Sounds like another drone API opportunity. I'd say the three top things impacting me when operating my drone(s) right now are 1) flight restrictions 2) weather, and 3) legal. I'm sure if you pulled together the data, provided a simple commercial API, you could do well delivering it to drone application developers and other platforms.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Oct 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/arlons_iot_poster.jpg" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/10/26/transparent-data-transfer-control-apis-at-the-iot-device-level/">I wrote about transparent data transfer control APIs at the IoT device level the other da</a>y, so it made me happy to come across&nbsp;<a href="http://waag.org/en/blog/dowse-onoff-switch-home-devices">Dowse, an on/off switch for home devices</a>&nbsp;while monitoring things today. This Internet of Things privacy and control device sounds like something that should be present in every home and business network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am still learning about it, but here is a short description from the post by WaaG, that I think describes it well:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The Dowse box gives you back control. Dowse is free and open source software. There is no big company behind it. By installing the Dowse box you will get insight down to the network layer of what is actually going on in your home. Who is talking to who, what, where and when? You can see which device connects to which company and you can turn that communication off. Or allow it.</em></p>
<p>This reflects the transparency I would like to see at the network level for every home and business. With the recent wave of IoT launched DDOS attacks we are going to need more discoverability, awareness, transparency, and control at the home and business and home network and<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play">&nbsp;Universal Plug and Play level</a>.</p>
<p>I'm not sure saying the Dowse box is the solution, but it provides us with one possible blueprint, similar to what I was talking about in my post on transparent data transfer control. In this IoT age, we are going to need device awareness to be a default, and transparency about which devices are talking to the Internet, when and what data they are transferring, and possibly even more security auditing and observability solutions.</p>
<p>It seems like the Dowse box concept should be baked into all home and business networking. I am well aware that a version of this does exist at the network administration level for most modern networking solutions, but I'm talking about the next generation, end-user friendly, mobile edition that makes devices monitoring, awareness, and control dead simple for anyone.</p>
<p>Of course, this layer would have an API to allow for the extending, and customizing of all of this. Now that I am coming across examples of this type of control at the IoT network level, I will keep scratching, and I'm confident I'll find other examples. Maybe enough thtat Ithatadd a section to<a href="http://internet-of-things.apievangelist.com/"> my Internet of Things and APIs research</a>.</p>

<p>I thought <a href="http://www.nanoscale.io/">the microservices platform Nanoscale.io</a> have an interesting argument for why you would upgrade to a paid plan. <a href="http://www.nanoscale.io/pricing/">On their pricing page</a>, after they break down each of the pricing plans they provide you with four reasons of why you would want to upgrade from their free tier.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>More powerful APIs -</strong> Your nanoscale.io hosted microservices can run longer and perform more complex operations, or access slower source systems, without timing out.</li>
<li><strong>Get premium support - </strong>Having a problem with nanoscale.io? Think you may have found a bug? Submit your inquiry and get a guaranteed response from our technical team.</li>
<li><strong>Influence product roadmap -</strong> We are open to new feature consideration, and give preference to paid accounts to influence which ones get built sooner.</li>
<li><strong>Deploy anywhere -</strong> Upgrade your downloadable nanoscale.io server with a production license to deploy your microservices on any infrastructure you choose.</li>
</ul>
<p>More power and support seems like no-brainers. Being able to influence the roadmap is a compelling reason and something I would pay money for! ;-) The deploy anywhere I think is a sign of the future, not just for how you will buy services for your API, this is how you will deploy your APIs for your consumers. In cloud. On-premise. On-device. You can consume our API anywhere you want--if you pay for it!</p>
<p><a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">I have been aggregating the plans and pricing of API providers, and service providers for a while now</a>. People are getting better at providing a decent breakdown of their API plans, but they aren't always that good at articulating the reasons why you would go from free to a paid plan. I think this is an area of stress, and concern for many API providers, and an area they could use more examples to follow from out in the wild.</p>

        <span class="post-date">27 Oct 2016</span>
        <p>Adrian Cockroft (@adrianco) turned me on to a DNS aggregation solution the other day while I was working on updating <a href="http://dns.apievangelist.com/apis/">the API definitions for the API providers that are included in my API DS research</a>. It was a very appropriate day for thinking deeply about aggregate DNS, with the DDOS attack against Dyn going on.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Netflix/denominator"><span>Denominator&nbsp;</span>is a portable Java library for manipulating DNS clouds</a>.

<p><a href="https://github.com/Netflix/denominator"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/68747470733a2f2f7261772e6769746875622e636f6d2f4e6574666c69782f64656e6f6d696e61746f722f6d61737465722f64656e6f6d696e61746f722e6a7067.jpeg" alt="" width="50%" align="center" /></a></p>
<p>There doesn't look to be a lot of activity around the project in the last year, but it provides a good model for what I'd like to eventually see across all the major stops along the API lifecycle. I picture a wealth of aggregate tooling like Denominator that can act as a broker between API service providers&nbsp;and help switch, migrate, and sync between providers whether you are deploying, managing, testing, monitoring, or dialing in your DNS.</p>
<p>As I read the multiple investigations into what happened with the DDOS attack on Dyn last week, it seems relevant to learn more about aggregate DNS API solutions like Denominator. I will spend some time looking for other similar open tooling that is vendor-neutral, as well as vendor-switchable. We are going to need open source circuit breakers like this to help route, switch, migrate, and sync DNS across many service providers in this volatile landscape.</p>

<p>Managing developers access to an API is <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/">API management 101</a>. Managing the relationships between developers, and allowing for multiple users associated with an API application isn't something I have seen before. <a href="https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/build-together-with-app-collaborators-8162e31800f1#.e5cc4ci7">Slack just added the ability to add what they call app collaborators</a>--"<span>adding any existing member of your Slack team as a Collaborator, including members and&nbsp;</span><a href="https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/202518103-Multi-Channel-and-Single-Channel-Guests">Guest Accounts</a><span>."</span></p>
<p>The functionality felt a lot like the social aspects that made Github more attractive than just Git. When it comes to developing messaging apps and bots I can see a social layer doing pretty well. "<span>Once a Collaborator is added, they&rsquo;ll receive a notification from Slackbot letting them know they now have access to your app." Smells like an opportunity for API management providers to bake into user management solution, and if you wanted to take it to the next level, add a Slack messaging layer as option.</span></p>
<p>Its a small feature, but I think it is one of the things that made Github work, and could have a similar impact at the API management level, allowing for more engagement between users who are working together on API integration. I am going to add it as a building block for my <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/">API management research</a>, even if I haven't seen it elsewhere. It is something I'd like to see more of, and maybe if I plant the bug, more providers will implement.</p>

<p class="p1">I am diving deep into the DJi drone developer platform, and one of the elements of <a href="https://developer.dji.com/guidance-sdk/documentation/introduction/index.html#api">the DJi Drone Guidance API that caught my attention was the data transfer control methods</a>. In this situation, the transfer control methods are designed for just the data being sent as part of the drone guidance systems, but I think it provides a blueprint that can be used across almost any IoT device connectivity.</p>
<p class="p1">DJI provides four methods for managing the drone data transfer control:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Start Transfer -&nbsp;</strong>Inform guidance to start data transfer.</li>
<li><strong>Stop Transfer -&nbsp;</strong>Inform guidance to stop data transfer.</li>
<li><strong>Release Transfer -</strong>&nbsp;Release the data transfer thread.</li>
<li><strong>Wait For Board Ready -</strong>&nbsp;Set callback function handler for hen data from guidance comes, it will be called by data transfer thread.</li>
</ul>
<p>The "wait for board ready" method acts as a sort of web hook, that can notify any application build on the API that data is now being transferred, opening up the possibilities for notifying a device owner, and operator that data is being transferred. To me, this can be a critical aspect of building trust that our devices have our best interests in mind, providing some essential transparency in the data layer of the IoT space.</p>
<p>Data transfer control APIs for IoT devices like this will not ensure healthy data practices. This implementation is designed to provide transfer control capabilities to the developer, it is now up to the developer to include the end users in this process. Many current mobile application business models do not incentivize this type of transparency, as you do not want end users, and often times 3rd party developers involved in data gathering, and revenue generation this valuable "exhaust" of Internet-connected devices.</p>
<p>I am hoping this evolves and changes as the Internet matures, and the number of connected devices increases. We need transparency at the device data transfer level, and we need all humans involved / impacted to be a literate, active, and will participate in the IoT data flow. I know many entrepreneurs think the end user isn't sophisticated enough to be involved, but this is more about your desire to keep any value generated for yourself&nbsp;than it is about the end-users capacity to grasp this stuff.</p>

<p>Many folks see me simply as a cheerleader for APIs&nbsp;when in reality I am more of an evangelist for the bad that can happen with APIs. I believe that sharing of data, content, and algorithms using web APIs has the potential for good, but in reality, they are often be used for doing some pretty shady shit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An example of this is found in my inbox this morning, and I'm sure is something everyone will encounter at some point in their daily lives. It is an email for an undelivered Fedex package, which I know better than to click on, but sadly I think it is one that many folks will fall for.</p>
<p>Why do they fall for this? Because the email potentially has relevance, as I just ordered a handful of packages from Amazon, which were being shipped via Fedex (I do not order much online). Using the FedEx&nbsp;API, anyone can query the status of a&nbsp;package. I'm assuming that there are&nbsp;folks out there who are scanning for the presence of delivering notifications--I'm not up to speed on the details of how you can do this. I'm unsure if they can get my email alongside this information, but I don't think this matters. I think they can correlate data about where I live, and the fact I'm receiving packages--whether the email came from API, or through other forms intelligence, it doesn't matter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My point is more around the fact that APIs are increasingly opening up signals about our daily lives, providing a wealth of context for phishing campaigns, increasing the chance that people will fall for these attacks. My solution to this problem does not involve a knee-jerk response to providing APIs, I am just looking to just warn API providers that they should be&nbsp;monitoring for this type of behavior on top of an API, and we should help the average email users&nbsp;and Amazon&nbsp;package&nbsp;receiver that these dangers exist. Everyone should pause and think deeply about each link or file attachment we click on--no matter how relevant it might seem in our daily flow.</p>

<p>I am going through the <a href="https://developer.dji.com/">DJi DJI drone developer area which has three distinct SDKs</a>, which allow us to leverage a variety of APIs that make the drone magic happen. I'm still wrapping my head around the intersection of drones and APIs, and this is my attempt to distil down what I'm finding in their developer area, and absorb some of what is going across the industry. This is not &nbsp;meant to be a complete list. It is meant for my learning, and hopefully yours along the way.</p>
<p>There are a variety of devices being connected to the Internet, but other than the automobile I don't think there is another object that is as complex as the drone. I'm fascinated by what is possible with this device, and the variety of APIs it has, the interaction with the RC controller, mobile device, and with other resources the clouds. I personally fly a DJI drone, so I am going through the DJI developer area, learning about their three SDKs, as they seem to be the ecosystem furthest along in their understanding the API potential -- think Twitter for IoT.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><a href="https://developer.dji.com/onboard-sdk/">The DJI Onboard SDK</a></strong>&nbsp;<br />This SDK allows for communication with the DJI flight controller over a direct serial connection, to monitor and control aircraft flight behavior with the Onboard API&nbsp;while utilizing the built-in Intelligent Navigation Modes to create autonomous flight paths and maneuvers. Some of the actions for the onboard SDK are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Activation -&nbsp;</strong><span>Before you start exploring DJI Onboard SDK functionality via our ROS examples, you will need to go through the "Activation" process.</span></li>
<li><strong>Obtain/Release Flight Control - </strong>Managing the process to get flight control.</li>
<li><strong>Take Off - </strong>Initiate a take-off&nbsp;for the drone.</li>
<li><strong>Landing - </strong>Tell the device to land.</li>
<li><strong>Go Home </strong>- Tell the device to go home.</li>
<li><strong>Gimbal Control </strong>- Manage gimbal for camera.</li>
<li><strong>Altitude Control -</strong> Manage the altitude for the drone.</li>
<li><strong>Photo Taking - </strong>Allow for taking photos</li>
<li><strong>Start/Stop Video Recording - </strong>Start and stop the video for camera.</li>
<li><strong>Virtual RC Control - </strong>C<span>ontrol the drone through serial port by simulated channel values.</span></li>
<li><strong>Broadcast Frequency Control -</strong> Manage which frequency drone is broadcasting on.</li>
<li><strong>Arm/Disarm Control -</strong> Arm or disram the controls.</li>
<li><strong>Timestamp Synchronization&nbsp;-</strong> Synchronize the timestamp -&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Native Waypoint -</strong> Manage the waypoints for mission.</li>
<li><strong>Hotpoint -</strong> Manage the hotpoint for circling.</li>
<li><strong>Local Navigation - </strong>Go to specified local position</li>
<li><strong>Global Navigation - </strong>Go to specified global position</li>

<li><strong>WebSocket With Baidu Map (for navigation) -</strong> Real time mapping.</li>
<li><strong>MAVLink And QGroundStation -</strong> Managing the vehicle to air communication.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">These are the actions that onboard SDK open up, but the SDK has other layers, that go beyond the drone itself, and is more about the space and environment around a drone, and its interaction with this world.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Velodyne LiDAR<br /></strong>Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors are for commercial UAS applications, such as 3D aerial mapping, surveying, inspection, collision avoidance, and autonomous navigation in potentially either indoor and outdoor environments. There are three distinct elements of the drones LiDAR system:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lidar API </strong>- Supporting the computation of point cloud and logging LiDAR data in real-time into a standard LAS (LiDAR Aerial Survey) or PCAP (packet capture) file</li>
<li><strong>Lidar Simulator -</strong> A LiDAR simulator for playing back PCAP files in real-time via the same Ethernet output as a real LiDAR for facilitating development and debugging for the system integration</li>
<li><strong>Lidar Logging -</strong> An API based example to demonstrate how to use the API of real-time point cloud computation and LAS/PCAP logging. It can also be used for the use case of the integration of Velodyne LiDAR with M100 without the onboard SDK</li>
</ul>
<p>LiDAR opens up another universe within the DJI onboard SDK, allowing for access the system through API, manage the logging around activity, also simulating common navigation elements in the environment.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>uAvionix ADS-B Receiver</strong><br />The pingRX ADS-B receiver allows the drone to receive real-time traffic information broadcasted by other manned or unmanned aircraft, as well as temporary flight restriction (TFR) information broadcasted&nbsp;by the government. With this type of situation awareness, the onboard embedded system (OES) will be able to make some safety-critical decisions like collision avoidance or self-separation.</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>Precision Trajectory Mission Planning</strong><br />With the Onboard SDK Precision Trajectory Mission Planning suite, DJI developers can now plan complex missions without having to use GPS waypoints. The new DJI Precision Trajectory Mission Planning library has the flexibility to deal with complicated trajectories, issues with GPS accuracy and cases when GPS is simply unavailable.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Trajectory following library that can autonomously execute preplanned smooth spiral trajectories</li>
<li>SketchUp plugin to visualize trajectories, import 3D CAD models and geolocate the scene</li>
<li>Configurable speed, start/end radii and pitch for the spiral</li>
<li>Start your drone from anywhere - real-time path planning to get to the trajectory's GPS location</li>
<li>Integration with DJI Assistant 2 to visualize simulations of the drone following the trajectory in the SketchUp scene</li>
</ul>
<p>That is a pretty robust SDK. I'm taking the&nbsp;time to learn about each action, as well as the more communication and mission planning components separately. I can tell that they are having trouble to keep the large amounts of functionality and features coherent, and organized in the documentation, one of the reasons I'm breaking out separately here on my blog.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><a href="https://developer.dji.com/guidance-sdk/">DJI Guidance SDK<br /></a></strong>Guidance SDK enables allows you to develop vision-based applications, by granting you full control over drone guidance. You can access all output data for any device using the DJI Guidance SDK--they break things down into five separate groups.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Initialization</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reset Config -&nbsp;</strong>Clear subscribed configure, if you want to subscribe data different from last time.</li>
<li><strong>Initialize Transfer -&nbsp;</strong><span>Initialize Guidance and create data transfer thread.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/mobile_sdk_54b1bdda33.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<ul>
<li><span><strong>Event Handler -&nbsp;</strong><span>Set callback function handler. When data from Guidance comes, it will be called by data transfer thread.</span></span></li>
<li><strong>Exposure Parameters -&nbsp;</strong>Get stereo calibration parameters.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><strong>Get Data</strong></p>
<ul>

<li><strong>Wait For Board Ready -</strong>&nbsp;<span>Set callback function handler. When data from guidance comes, it will be called by data transfer thread.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>This SDK seems to be real time senses of the drone, allowing you to develop the experience you need to be in control, and guiding the device.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Data Types<br /></strong>One of the thing that captivates me about the whole drone thing is its data collection capacity. I'm still learning about what is possible with the drone itself, but I know that much of the value generated by these flights will be based&nbsp;on the data that is gathered, as well as the images and video recorded. Here are the data points I have found so far in the DJI documentation for the DJI Guidance SDK.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Error Code -</strong> Enumerates possible error codes. When error occurs, usually an error code will be given, and the developer can reference this enum to find the error type.</li>
<li><strong>Velocity Data - </strong>Velocity in body frame. The unit is millimeter/second and the frequency is 10 Hz.</li>
<li><strong>Obstacle Distance Data -</strong> Obstacle distance from five Guidance Sensors. The unit is centimeter and the frequency is 20 Hz.</li>
<li><strong>IMU Data -</strong> IMU data including accelerometer (in unit of acceleration of gravity g) and gyroscope (in quaternion format) data. The frequency is 20 Hz.</li>
<li><strong>Motion Data - </strong>Pose and velocity data including quaternion orientation, position in the global frame, velocity in the global frame.</li>
<li><strong>Ultrasonic Data - </strong>Outputs ultrasonic data from five Guidance Sensors, including obstacle distance (in unit of meter) and reliability of the data. The frequency is 20 Hz.</li>
<li><strong>Greyscale Image - </strong>Outputs Greyscale images for five directions. The image size is 320*240 bytes for individual sensor. The default frequency is 20 Hz and can be scaled down using API functions.</li>
<li><strong>Depth Image - </strong>Outputs depth images for five directions. The image size is 320*240*2 bytes for each direction. The default frequency is 20 Hz and can be scaled down using API functions.</li>
<li><strong>Disparity Image -</strong> Outputs disparity images for five directions. This data is useful when developers want to further refine the disaprity images using functions like speckle filter.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>This data is generated constantly by a drone, and you have control over this transfer process through the DJI Guidance SDK. I'm thinking I need to aggregate some JSON schemas for this data, to better help me understand the depth&nbsp;and relationships in this data. There is a lot going on here, and a wealth of data to consider in a wide range of scenarios.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>DJI Drone Mobile SDK</strong><br />I use the DJI drone application to operate my two drones. The DJI Drone Mobile SDK is where you can get to work crafting your own custom application, to deliver exactly the drone operation experience you want. This is what the iPhone application was for mobile, but this is for the consumer and commercial drone world. There are a wealth of areas you can develop around in this SDK:</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/onboard_sdk_d6bc94cc85.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://developer.dji.com/mobile-sdk/documentation/introduction/component-guide-flightController.html">Flight Controller</a></strong> - The flight controller is an onboard computer that combines control information from the pilot with sensor information to adjust the thrust at each propellor and fly the aircraft as desired.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developer.dji.com/mobile-sdk/documentation/introduction/component-guide-camera.html">Camera</a></strong> - The camera captures photos and videos. Many different modes of operation, resolutions, frame rates, exposure settings, picture settings and file types can be selected. Cameras have local storage to hold the media which will typically be an SD card, and in some cases an SSD (solid state drive).</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developer.dji.com/mobile-sdk/documentation/introduction/component-guide-gimbal.html">Gimbal</a></strong> - Cameras fixed to an aircraft will record images that pitch and roll with the aircraft as it moves. Multi rotor aircraft need to pitch and roll simply to move horizontally, and so getting a stable horizontal shot is not possible.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developer.dji.com/mobile-sdk/documentation/introduction/component-guide-airlink.html">Airlink</a></strong> - AirLink describes the wireless link between aircraft, remote controllers, handheld cameras and mobile devices.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developer.dji.com/mobile-sdk/documentation/introduction/component-guide-remotecontroller.html">Remote Controller</a></strong> - The remote controller allows manual flight, gimbal and camera control, and provides a robust wireless control link for aircraft. The mobile device can connect to the remote controller to communicate to the aircraft and receive the live video stream from the camera.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developer.dji.com/mobile-sdk/documentation/introduction/component-guide-battery.html">Smart Battery </a></strong>- Smart batteries provide the energy required to run the products. Together with the flight controller, the smart battery can estimate remaining flight time and provide warnings when low battery thresholds are crossed. Batteries are easily swapped between flights, extending product use considerably.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developer.dji.com/mobile-sdk/documentation/introduction/component-guide-missions.html">Missions</a></strong> - Missions can be used to easily automate flight. There are many different mission types that offer different product behavior. Some missions can be uploaded to and managed by the aircraft, while other missions are managed from the mobile device.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developer.dji.com/mobile-sdk/documentation/introduction/sdk-guide-sdkmanager.html">SDK Manager</a> -</strong> Application registration to use the DJI Mobile SDK, product connection, debugging and logging services are handled through the SDK manager class DJISDKManager.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think that this stack of features speaks for itself. Providing a wealth of valuable API-driven resources to think about. This blows my mind as I begin to think about the possibilities&nbsp;for developing drone applications&nbsp;but gets even better when you think about how this also applies to the rest of the IoT world. Flight controller might not apply universally, but cameras, batteries, remote control, and the network are all ubiquitous with other IoT devices, and in my world should be considered beyond just drones.</p>
<p>I just needed to wrap my head around what programmatic resources are available to me as a DJI drone operator and developer. Next, I will be diving in and learning about some of the more interesting layers of this drone ecosystem, but first I am more interested in spending time looking through the platform API and SDK resources for other drone platforms, as well as some of the data solution providers like <a href="https://www.airmap.com/">Airmap</a>, and other physical components providers like <a href="http://www.flir.com/home/">FLIR for imaging</a>, and <a href="https://www.lumecube.com/">LumeCube for lighting</a>. I am always having to pick my battles on how deep on want to go down each rabbit hole&nbsp;or stay at the high level for a wider perspective.</p>
<p>There is a lot going on here. I find drones fascinating from a technical perspective, and terrifying when it comes to surveillance, privacy, policing, and some of the other bad behavior we've seen recently. Like other areas of the tech space, I think APIs are important for not just managing devices and the experience, but also provide transparency, logging, auditing, and other <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/10/25/thinking-about-an-api-observability-stack/">observability considerations</a> when it comes to the Internet of Things space.</p>

<p>I get why people are interested in voice-enabled&nbsp;solutions like Alexa and Siri. I'm personally not a fan of speaking to get what I want, but I get the attraction for others. Similarly,&nbsp;I get why people are interested in bot enabled solutions like Facebook and Slack are bringing to the table, but I'm personally not a fan of the human-led noise in both of these channels, let alone automating this mayhem with bots.</p>
<p>In short, I'm not 100% on board that voice and bots will be as revolutionary as promised. I do think they will have a significant impact and are worthy of paying attention to, but when it comes to API driven conversational interfaces, I'm putting my money on push driven approaches to making API magic happen. Approaches like <a href="https://zapier.com/zapbook/push/">Push by Zapier</a>, and <a href="https://webtask.io/">Webtask.io</a>, where you can initiate a single, or chain of API driven events from the click on a button in the browser, in a web page, on my mobile phone, or hell, using the <a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2016/10/18/aws-iot-help-button/">Amazon Dash button approach</a>.</p>
<p>These web tasks operate in an asynchronous way, making them more conversational-esque. Allowing those of us who are anti-social, and have <a href="http://kinlane.com/2016/10/07/an-air-gap-between-me-and-the-online-world/">adequate air gapped our social and messaging channels</a>, and haven't fully subscribed to the surveillance economy, alternate solutions. These mediums could even facilitate a back and forth, passing machine readable values, until the desired result has been achieved. Some conversations could be predefined or saved, allowing me to trigger using a button at any point (ie. reorder that product from Amazon, retweet that article from last week). I'm not saying I don't want to have an API-enabled conversation, I'm just not sure I want a speaker or bot always present to get what I need to get done in my day.</p>
<p>I understand that I am not the norm. There are plenty of folks who have no problem with devices listening around their home or business, and are super excited when it comes to engaging with half-assed artificial intelligence wich accomplish basic tasks in our world(s). But I can't be that far out in left field. I'm thinking the landscape for conversational interfaces will be diverse, with some voice, some chat, and hopefully also some asynchronous approaches to having conversations that can be embedded&nbsp;anywhere across our virtual and physical worlds.</p>

<p>One of the things I love about my world as the API Evangelist is the time I get diving into rabbit holes and learning about different areas where technology is being applied. I do not always agree with the business motivations behind what is going on, which can result in some often pretty shady situations, but I enjoy stepping back and understanding the data, API and approaches behind what is going on.</p>
<p>I was doing some research on drone APIs recently, and as I was falling down the rabbit hole,&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.quandl.com/drone-data-for-investing">I found myself reading about drones being a source of alpha</a>? WTF is alpha? I had no idea and wanted to learn more about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_generation_platform">what an alpha generation platform</a> was, and how drones and APIs are playing a role--here is the definition I found:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>An alpha generation platform is a technology solution used in algorithmic trading to develop quantitative financial models, or trading strategies, that generate consistent alpha, or absolute returns. The process of alpha generation refers to generating excess returns.</em></p>
<p>The article that triggered this is about drones generating alpha was focused on the data generation, and communication capabilities of drones, and how they can be used in trading algorithms. Companies are looking to fly over crops, and predict yields, aggregate data, and add to the resources that available in the "alpha generation platform".</p>
<p>I'm not convinced of the reality of this approach, but it does provide for some interesting scenarios as I am learning about the data drones can gather, how this transfer occurs to the cloud, and be put to work using existing approaches to video, image, analysis, and visualization APIs. Also, it provides fuel for my alternate design fiction writing, where I explore the possibilities&nbsp;of technology, both good and bad.</p>
<p>From what I understand, this type of data would be considered "dirty" in the alpha workflow, in the same category of other data, you might gather from Amazon sales, Twitter sentiment, and other common API implementations. It's experimental, and not proven (yet) to produce the consistent or absolute returns I guess. What the article is discussing, are just early discussions, speculations, and desires of people looking to create a market--interesting fairy tales to tune into. Well, this is how markets operate right? On stories?</p>
<p>I'm adding high-frequency trading&nbsp;and alpha&nbsp;generation to my list of sectors potentially being impacted by drones. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/08/access-to-satellite-imagery-via-a-web-api/">Another area I'm diving into that intersects with this work are satellite APIs</a>. Satellite and drones intersect as drones are being used to fill in where satellite imagery can fall short (weather, low level buildings, etc.), but satellites are also being used as an alpha generation tool for high-frequency trading. I'm guessing drones and satellites are going to overlap with many other sectors like agriculture, mining, and the environment.</p>
<p>Lots of API and drone goodness to keep my mind busy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Internet-connected devices generate data. The most recent wave of mobile devices has opened up an unprecedented world of data generation and harvesting from the network, device, and application layers. The location data, photos, videos, and other valuable exhaust from these devices is why there has been so much investment in technology, and why we are seeing continued investment in the Internet of Things (IoT).</p>
<p>When it came to mobile phones this opportunity was new, and it isn't always clear that we are the product when it comes to making money off connecting these devices to the Internet. People aren't always aware of how much data they are generating, and how much this data is generating revenue for the latest generation of entrepreneurs--because it's new. Things have moved along, and it's not a secret anymore that devices connected to the Internet generating data has the potential to be very valuable in the right situation.</p>
<p>I have been historically frustrated with people's lack of awareness of this, but I'm hoping that with each wave of technology that comes in the future, we will get smarter about this, and stop being the product when we can, and begin demanding a piece of this action (if we do it at all). If our wearable fitness device is used in any healthcare study, if that weather, water, or pollution sensor in our yard is generating revenue, we should get a piece of the action. If a device in our homes or businesses is generating data, we should be a more aware of, and willing participant in this new supply chain.</p>
<p>The average person may not always care about their privacy&nbsp;in the surveillance economy, but maybe they'll care about lost opportunities for making money. At the consumer level this isn't always a coherent&nbsp;argument, but as you approach the work at home world, and into the professional territory, it can begin making more sense. Not all weather and pollution monitors might make sense for this, but when you start thinking about participating in clinical trials and operating your own drone fleet in farm country, revenue share models for Internet-connected devices might seem a little more realistic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Silicon Valley prefers an unaware, data-illiterate consumer, and even business class of users. I prefer a more aware, and data literate society, which is one reason I'm so big on APIs. Opening up 3rd party access, metering, and potentially revenue share opportunities for business, professionals, and individuals is one of the reasons I think APIs are important for all of this to work. I will keep studying how APIs are being used to generate, transmit, and generate revenue for platform providers, and device operators, so that I can hopefully keep pulling back the curtain on how the sausage is being made so that more of us can play in the game, and get a piece of the action.</p>

        <span class="post-date">25 Oct 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/datadog_observability_dashboard.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I am learning about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observability">observability</a> from reading Stripes <a href="https://stripe.com/blog/introducing-veneur-high-performance-and-global-aggregation-for-datadog">post on Veneur, a high performance and global aggregation for Datadog</a>. While the math of it all is over my head, the definition makes a lot of sense and provides me with a nice Venn&nbsp;diagram overlap across <a href="http://apievangelist.com">several areas of my API research</a>, including testing, monitoring, logging, analysis, and visualization.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observability">The Wikipedia definition for observability is</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Formally, a system is said to be observable if, for any possible sequence of state and control vectors, the current state can be determined in finite time using only the outputs (this definition is slanted towards the state space representation). Less formally, this means that from the system's outputs it is possible to determine the </em>behavior<em> of the entire system. If a system is not observable, this means the current values of some of its states cannot be determined through output sensors.</em></p>
<p>Stripe provides a great technical breakdown of the tools, services used to establish observability as part of their system operations, but I wanted to step back, and think about observability through a business and political lens. The business imperative for observability might seem clear, as you want as much visibility and awareness into your API operations as you possibly can, so you can provide a reliable level of service. I am thinking about the incentives for extending this observability beyond internal groups, to partners, developers, regulators, or the public--encouraging transparent observability.</p>
<p>This moves into <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/04/pushing-for-more-algorithmic-transparency-using-apis/">the area of API and algorithmic transparency you hear me ranting about regularly</a>, and t<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/10/14/transparency-in-police-access-to-social-platforms-using-oauth-and-apis/">he benefits APIs bring to the table when you apply in areas like policing and surveillance</a>, or other more regulated sectors of our society. When you take <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/10/07/regulatory-api-monitoring-for-validating-algorithmic-assertions/">the assertions applied as part of API testing and monitoring practices</a>, and you link them up to this observability stack definition, and open things up beyond just core technical groups, I think we are moving into new territory where we can begin to observe the real-time state of the systems that are increasingly making critical decisions in our lives.</p>
<p>I saw the potential for observability and awareness in the API layer back in 2010 with the <a href="http://logging.apievangelist.com">logging</a>, <a href="http://analysis.apievangelist.com/">analytics</a>, <a href="http://visualization.apievangelist.com/">visualizations</a> aspects of early <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/">API management</a> solutions like <a href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a>. In 2016, I'm thinking these benefits are going well beyond just the business of APIs, and can provide some of the critical transparency we are going to need to understand the behavior of increasingly complex corporate, institutional, and governmental systems, that in many cases we will have to be able to understand from the outside in using existing "output sensors".</p>
<p>In the future, we should be able to define any system as observable or not, when APIs are in play.</p>

</ul>
<p>As I curate the interesting news from across the API space each week I tag things to put them into different buckets. At the end of each week, I look through each bucket, deciding which area(s) I will be writing about each week. I am always trying to identify patterns and evolve the different areas of my research. One of the areas I'm considering adding as a formal area of API research is when it comes to certification.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been seeing the area come up quite a bit, making me think it is something I should be thinking more about, and researching&nbsp;as its own project. This week there were four items thought caught my attention:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://blog.bigml.com/2016/10/21/bigml-certifications-are-here/">BigML Certifications are Here!</a> - Professional certification on machine learning APIs, from a leading API provider.</li>
<li><a href="http://boingboing.net/2016/10/20/better-business-bureau-yanks-w.html">Better Business Bureau yanks Wells Fargo's accreditation</a> - &nbsp;Ok, not quite certification, but a classic representation and story to consider.</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.erratasec.com/2016/10/why-cybersecurity-certifications-suck.html">Why cybersecurity certifications suck</a> - A look into why certifications can be better, and applied in a critical area of the online world.</li>
<li><a href="https://eligible.com/blog/eligible-announces-soc2-certification/">Eligible Announces SOC2 Certification</a> - Certification than an insurance API provider on their availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, or privacy.</li>
</ul>
<p>These posts came after another four items from last week, providing, even more, to think about when it comes to APIs and certification:</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://boingboing.net/2016/10/13/a-new-certification-program-fo.html">A new certification program for Open Source Hardware</a> - I certify that I am truly open source, not that faux open source you see a lot of--we are the real deal!</li>
<li><a href="http://www.avnetwork.com/avnetwork/online-dante-certification-program-now-available/125135">Online Dante Certification Program Now Available</a> - Professional certification on audio APIs, from an older school software provider.</li>
<li><a href="https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2016/10/transform-your-business-become-a-Google-Certified-Professional-Data-Engineer.html">Transform your business; become a Google Certified Professional Data Engineer</a> - Professional certification that you know your stuff when it comes to data, specifically data in the Google ecosystem--data engineers are hot.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/ibm-launches-watson-application-developer-certification/">IBM launches Watson application developer certification</a> - Another professional certification for machine learning and artificial intelligence, this time from big blue.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a lot going on here when it comes to the concept of certification. I guess the BigML, Dante, and IBM certifications are more of what had in my head entering this post, but thinking about the shady shit that Wells Fargo has been up to, and thoughts on certifying that you are "ethical open source", or "honest open source" is fascinating to ponder as part of the big picture.</p>
<p>Another thing that stands out for me in these certification stories, is that there are two separate certifications for machine learning across the last two week. I can't help but think that there is some sort of purification going on in this ritual, or a sort of validation of the thing behind the certification, meaning that if you certify that professionals know this thing, then the thing, must be a thing. Right? IDK, I just can't help but think more of the motivations behind doing certifications, and the psychology behind how they are perceived (right or wrong)</p>
<p>I'm inches away from adding certification as an official API research area, so I can keep a closer eye on it. I've never been a big certification guy, but I understand why they exist, and why some people invest in them. If I add it as a research area, I'll dive in deeper to map out which API certifications exist out there, and which ones might provide a good model for other API providers to look at, or maybe even what to consider NOT doing when crafting your certification program.</p>

<p>I am seeing more people asking that we put on the brakes when it comes to technology, looking to slow the adoption of new technology, in favor of mastery of the existing, and getting our house in order with the technology we already in play. One of the core tenets of my message as the API Evangelist centers on the importance of doing what we are already doing&nbsp;and doing it better. <a href="https://www.govfresh.com/2014/01/next-us-government-api-strategy/">You can see this message present in my 2014 recommendation on an API strategy for the US federal government</a>--do more of what is already in motion, don't disrupt by just doing the new.</p>
<p>I have seen a lot of API technology float by in the last six years of doing API Evangelist. I can still get excited by some of it, but far less than I did in 2010 when I first started. This is partly because I'm tired, but mostly it is because I've seen a lot of shit float by, and it has to be meaningful in some way to get me excited. I am fairly willing to keep an open mind when it comes to microservices, DevOps, GraphQL, voice, bots, drones, and the other technological frontlines, but I refuse to accept that technology has to mindlessly march forward. This is more about selling us new things than it is every about truly bringing us real solutions to everyday problems.</p>
<p>Whether it's addressing technical debt and monoliths, the security concerns of the Internet of Things, or anything in between, we should always work to step back and ask if the new technology will actually provide a solution, or create three new problems for each solution it brings. I am not anti new tech, I love new shiny tech objects, but I think for our own sanity we should learn to be more thoughtful. New technology trends can be exciting, and fun to play with, but when it comes to production environments, and getting important things done, maybe it should stay in the R&amp;D lab or sandbox until it matures.</p>
<p>Maybe we can spend 2017 just taking care of what we already have in motion, and put a moratorium on any new and exciting projects until we get better at testing, usability, security, and other areas we seem to regularly suffer from in our operations. Maybe we can just do all those API implementations that we have the queue, over the next version of existing resources. IDK, if nothing else, maybe we can just a breather and allow us to play catch up a little, and ponders on what matters most.</p>

        <span class="post-date">25 Oct 2016</span>
        <p><a href="http://dns.apievangelist.com/patents/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/company/logos/uspto.png" alt="" width="25%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/01/27/my-stance-on-apis-and-patents/">I have been tracking on API related patents for some time</a>. I regularly pull XML dumps from the US Patent Office, a process in which I am getting more refined, so that I am able to easily tag, and organize them alongside the rest of my research. I spent some time this last week diving <a href="http://dns.apievangelist.com">into my DNS API research</a>, and after updating the rest of the data behind, I added <a href="http://dns.apievangelist.com/patents/">some DNS related patents</a>.</p>
<p>The patent information is already available in my API monitoring system, I just needed to be able to tag the patents, and write a script to publish the tagged patents&nbsp;to each of my Github projects. Now that I have this in place, it is pretty easy for me to spend an hour or two looking through the patents that come each week, and putting them into each area of the API space I study--which is why I have organized my API research the way that I have.</p>
<p>The patent information provides shines another light on each layer of the space for me. Understanding the companies, tools, and individual API endpoints provide me with important insight on what is going on, but the patents being submitted are an extremely important indicator of what is actually going on behind the curtain within industries, and companies. With this addition, my research is finally reaching the levels I originally envisioned when I first began organizing my work in this way, going beyond what is available on the "features" page for each company, organization, institution, or government agency is doing with APIs.</p>
<p>I can extract a lot of information from the product pages of the companies who are doing APIs, but these pages are designed to tell a specific story. I find that API definitions, press releases, and patent filings often tell a different story than the company's main product page. I would say that all these areas lie, but marketing, API definitions, press releases, and patent filings are all designed to tell specific untruths designed for different masters, and when you lay them side by side you begin to see a more complete picture of what is really going on in the API space.</p>

        <span class="post-date">24 Oct 2016</span>
        <p>I have blogged about this topic in the last 60 days, but I predict it is an area you will hear from me about regularly until I see it baked into more software solutions. <a href="http://cloudflare.com">CloudFlare, one of my favorite DNS API providers</a>&nbsp;has what I think is the best approach to linking to an API in the bottom corner of every UI element in their dashboard. If you look in the bottom right corner, next to the help icon you will see an API link.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/cloudflare_ui_api_1.png" alt="" width="75%" align="center" /></p>
<p>When I click on the API link I'm given the API path that corresponds to the UI element. In this scenario it allows me to purge the cache for my domain.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2016_10_23_at_11.14.58_pm.png" alt="" width="75%" align="center" /></p>
<p><a href="https://api.cloudflare.com/#zone-purge-all-files">I am also given a link to the full CloudFlare API documentation</a>. I have always been an advocate for companies making sure to have an "API" or "Developer" link in the footer of their main website. If you can make sure and have it front and center in the global navigation--all the better. Now I"m going to be advocating for an inline approach like CloudFlare. If all software as a service (SaaS) providers provided API transparency and access in this way, it would be a much different landscape.</p>
<p>The more people that know about APIs, the more people are putting them to work developing web and mobile applications, to assist us in moving our valuable bits and bytes around the cloud using iPaaS services like Zapier, and the increasing number of other applications APIs are being put to work in. When you make APIs accessible in this way, it transforms <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/10/11/ipaas-in-your-browser-with-push-by-zapier/">API solutions like Push by Zapier</a> into some pretty empowering solutions for helping the average business user put APIs to work, whenever and wherever they need.</p>
<p>Inline access to the API resources behind ALL UI elements is something I will be writing about regularly. Hopefully, I won't have to just keep talking about CloudFlare, and some other SaaS providers step up as well. If you are doing this, or know of a software provider that is as well, let me know so I can showcase here on the site.</p>

<p>I was pretty happy when my friend Arnaud Lauret&nbsp;(<a href="https://twitter.com/arno_di_loreto?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">@arno_di_loreto</a>) developed&nbsp;<a href="http://apistylebook.com/">API Stylebook</a>. I want to see his work expand and grow into someday containing hundreds or thousands of API design guides. To help contribute to his work I took the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/arno-di-loreto/apistylebook-api/blob/master/design/topics.yaml">YAML core of the design topics</a>&nbsp;he's aggregated and began developing <a href="https://api-evangelist-tools.github.io/api-design-guide/">an API design guide builder that runs 100% on </a><a href="https://api-evangelist-tools.github.io/api-design-guide/">Github</a>, allowing anyone to fork, and use to build their own API Stylebook on top of Arnaud's work.</p>
<p>Currently, I have two screens for API design guide builder:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://api-evangelist-tools.github.io/api-design-guide/edit/">Editor</a>&nbsp;- Allows for the editing of the YAML API Design Stylebook stored in the Github repository.</li>
<li><a href="https://api-evangelist-tools.github.io/api-design-guide/view/">View</a>&nbsp;- Allows you to view the API Design Stylebook stored in the Github repository.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm a big fan of this approach to developing little machine readable (YAML / JSON) micro tools that are simply HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a data core. In this scenario, Arnaud's design topics act's as the machine readable YAML core. I just developed the self-contained editor, and viewer, allowing anyone to fork and use to manage their own API design guide.</p>
<p>This is just a prototype. I am just getting started. I am looking to add autocomplete suggestions based on the other API design guides that Arnaud has aggregated in his API Stylebook. I am adding this, and some other features to the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist-tools/api-design-guide/issues">Github issues for the project</a>, if you have any feedback or suggestions feel free to submit an issue to the Github repository.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My objective here is to allow anyone to quickly fork, and build their own corporate or project API design guide, built on top of the existing best practices out there. I envision a future where every company, organization, institution, and an agency has their own API design guide, building on the best approaches available. Arnaud can continue to aggregate and merge the best practices (using Github) out there, and API providers can keep forking, and building on top of the best practices of the APIs they look up to across the landscape (another feature I want to add).</p>
<p>I really like what Arnaud has done with the&nbsp;<a href="http://apistylebook.com/">API Stylebook</a>. It reflects my own building block approach across <a href="http://apievangelist.com">my 70+ API research projects</a>, where I'm looking distil down what is happening&nbsp;across each stop along the API life cycle. I will be forking the API Stylebook design topics, and API design guides they have indexed, and adding to my own <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">API design research</a>. I am having fun building on top of his work&nbsp;and look forward to what other folks build on top of it as well.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2016/10/24/preserving-the-twitter-api-field-guide/">Preserving The Twitter API Field Guide</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">24 Oct 2016</span>
        <p>I'm a fan of the human elements of this technological shift that is going on in our world. We tend to focus on the technology, and the dudes who do the technologies (the cyber is HUGE), but what will really matter in 50 or 100 years will be the more human aspects of how we did all of this. Trust me, it is hard to make this boring ass API shit human in any way, so I am always excited when there are people&nbsp;who soften the hard edges of the gears as they grind forward.</p>
<p>One of the moments that has stood out for me in the last decade&nbsp;was the Twitter API Field Guide created by Taylor Singletary (<a href="https://twitter.com/episod">@episod</a>) during his time as an evangelist at Twitter. This field guide was removed by Twitter (not sure when as I just noticed today), but <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2012/field-guide-of-platform-objects">the original blog post remained</a>. Thank the Internet gods <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131017194923/https://dev.twitter.com/docs/platform-objects">for the Internet Archive (and Tyler pointing it out),</a> because a copy of his work still lives on for us all to enjoy.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2016_10_24_at_3.54.55_pm.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>I wanted to make sure a copy of it lives on beyond Twitter, and the Internet Archive, <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist/twitter-field-guide">so I copied (cleaned up) and published on Github (ha)</a>. While this work may seem out of date, and irrelevant, it is art and will be something we will look back on fondly in the future--it shouldn't simply be deleted. This is one of the problems with the constant change we have embraced in the tech space--many things we care about will just be deleted and lost forever.</p>
<p>For me, the Twitter Field Guide represents a specific time in the history of the web, and as I write this post I realize this was a dark time for API optimism in the Twitter API ecosystem, something that was having an effect on the wider API movement. I think this field guide was a very creative human response as we are struggling with not just the technical of the Twitter API, but the business and politics of operating an API platform at this scale. While it was just one iteration in the API documentation, it is like that vintage auto industry poster from 1930s&nbsp;and provides us with an important snapshot of this period in time, and should be preserved.</p>
<p>I understand that the documentation is out of date, which is probably why it was taken down, but this reflects what is wrong with technology as our master. It demands that we always march forward, with almost no consideration for human things that exist in the cracks. I do not expect tech companies to maintain everything old, but they should allow for archiving and preservation. <a href="http://twitter-field-guide.apievangelist.com/">I have copied and cleaned up a copy of the Twitter API Field Guide from the Internet Archive, and operating as a Github repository</a>. If you work at Twitter, please don't ask me to take this down--I'm not trying to disrespect the brand or platform, I'm just trying to keep your history alive. Plus I have copies, and I'll just keep putting back up. ;-)</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/04/12/the-api-purgatory-museum/">I have talked about the API purgatory museum before</a>, and if there are any API relics you'd like to see preserved feel free to drop me a line, and I'll see what I can do.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2016/10/24/amazon-groups-should-share-more-api-design-patterns/">Amazon Groups Should Share More API Design Patterns</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">24 Oct 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/squirrelbin_arch.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>The sharing of common API design patterns is something we are really bad at in the API space. I'm not a believer that there is one API design pattern to rule them all, but I am a believer in learning from what works, consuming other people's APIs, and sharing design tips over the cubicle wall. I don't believe that everyone should be 100% REST-compliant in the crafting of their APIs, but you should be picking your head up from time to time, and learning from what the rest of the world is up to, especially across the other groups within your own company.</p>
<p>I tend to shy away on critiquing companies on API design, and prescribing any specific approach, but I can't help but point out inconsistencies in any approach, when it is clear that they aren't tuning into some of the common patterns out there, especially between their own internal groups. An example of this can be found at one of the API gods, Amazon Web Services. Amazon isn't known for their RESTful APIs, which is something I can overlook, but&nbsp;when it comes to their lack consistency between their different APIs, I think there are lessons for all of us to learn from.</p>
<p>I have not hacked against all of the Amazon APIs, but here are the four distinct patterns I've seen:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTBucketOps.html">S3</a>&nbsp;- </strong>/?{method}</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_Operations.html">EC2</a>&nbsp;- </strong>/?Action={method}</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_Operations_Amazon_Route_53.html">Route 53</a>&nbsp;-</strong> /2013-04-01/{methodname}</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_Operations_Amazon_Route_53_Domains.html"></a><a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_Operations_Amazon_Route_53_Domains.html">Route 53 Domains</a>&nbsp;-</strong>&nbsp;route53domains.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/ header: x-amz-target:Route53Domains_v20140515.{method}</li>
</ul>
<p>There might be additional patterns employed over at other Amazon APIs, but these are the four that I'm exposed to in my own integrations. The presence of two separate patterns within the Route 53 team was what prompted me to write this post. While I'm not a fan of the action={method} approach, which is the most common AWS pattern I have seen used, the passing of method as part of custom header just seems even wackier to me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not get dogmatic about specific API design patterns, but I do think that a lack of awareness of common patterns, especially across groups within the same company is counterproductive. I think Amazon has done amazing things as a pioneer in the space, forever changing how we deliver data, content, and algorithmic resources online, but I think they would benefit from a company-wide API design campaign. <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/tools/design-guides/">Something like Microsoft, Paypal, and others have done, to help standardize how they design APIs across all internal groups</a>.</p>

<p>I was reading&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/optimizing-amazon-s3-for-high-concurrency-in-distributed-workloads/">optimizing Amazon S3 for high concurrency in distributed workloads from AWS</a>, and the diagram they provided, daisy chaining each of the AWS services at play, really brought the concept home for me. I read a lot, but I also scan a lot, and meaningful diagrams like this can go a long way to help me get up to speed as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>I have been <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/01/25/moving-towards-a-meaningful-set-of-icons-for-the-api-community/">an advocate for establishing icon sets for common API technologies, and even service providers</a>, and I think I will add individual API resources to the stack. It would be valuable to have icon sets for common API resources like images, video, storage, etc. Icons that spoke to what they did, but also clearly identifies them as an API resource&nbsp;and allowing them to possibly be daisy chained together like Amazon does.</p>
<p>API industry icons will have to wait until some benefactor steps up to invest in this crazy idea. I'm graphically challenged, I know what looks good, but I can't craft anything graphical to save my life--look at my logo. Even if we don't have an industry-wide set of icons, it might be something individual API providers would want to consider creating for their API resources, like Amazon does. It is something that could help make your storytelling more impactful, and provide a common set of icons for everyone to use when referencing specific API resources.</p>

<p>I've been thinking about the concept of a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/09/is-your-api-ready-for-wholesale/">wholesale API</a> for some time. Going beyond how we technically deploy our APIs, and focusing more on how we can provide a wholesale version of the same API resources, with accompanying terms of services that go beyond just a retail level of API access in the cloud. Not all APIs fit into this category of API, but with the containerization of everything, and the evolving world of Internet of Things (IoT), there are many new ways in which API resources are being deployed.</p>
<p>You can see this evolution in how we are deploying APIs present in one of the latest API deployment platforms I added to my <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">API deployment</a> research, <a href="http://www.nanoscale.io/platform/">Nanoscale.io</a>. This image is just a portion of their platform, but the separation of deployment concerns articulates the technical side of what I'm talking about, we just need to add in considerations for the business and political side of how this works.</p>
<p>We've seen API deployment move from on-premise and back again, and now we are seeing it move onto everyday objects like cameras, printers, routers, and other everyday objects. I'm watching service providers like Nanoscale.io emerge to help us deploy our APIs exactly where we need them. I'm guessing that the companies who have their business models in similar order, allowing for API service composition from the <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/">management layer</a> to further slide down the stack to the <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">deployment</a> layer, will come out ahead.</p>

I was going through <a href="https://tyk.io/docs/tyk-dashboard-v1-0/dashboard-api/api-definitions/">Tyk's&nbsp;API for their open source API management solution and came across their API definitions API</a>, which gives you a list of APIs for each Tyk deployment--baking in API discovery into the open source API management solution by default.</p>
<p>The API API (I still enjoy saying that) gives you the authentication, paths, versioning, and other details about each API being managed. I'm writing about this because I think that an API API should be the default for all API service providers. If you are selling me API services you should have an API for all your services, especially one that allows me to discover&nbsp;and manage all the APIs I'm applying your service to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/12/07/minimum-viable-api-service-provider-blueprint/">expanding my definition of a minimum viable blueprint for API service providers</a>, and adding an API API as one of the default APIs. I'm going to be adding the account, billing, and a handful of other essential APIs to my default definition. If I'm using your service to manage any part of my API operations, I need to be automating discovery, management, and billing in our relationship.</p>
<p>It seems obvious to me but I'm looking to provide a simple checklist that other API service providers can consider as they craft their strategy. My goal is to help make sure each stop along the lifecycle can be orchestrated in a programmatic way like Tyk.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-forward.png" alt="" width="30%" align="right" /></p>
<p>This is a&nbsp;topic that has come up in several discussions lately&nbsp;and is a topic I struggle with on a regular basis. What is more important, helping new users, both developer and non-developer be more aware of APIs, or is helping push forward the concept of APIs amongst those who are already tuned in? While I don't think there is a perfect answer, I think it is an important concept to explore and discuss.</p>
<p>I started API Evangelist on the premise of helping educate new users about the importance of APIs&nbsp;and is something I regularly strive to do, but if you read my blog I definitely do not always keep things simple and accessible&nbsp;to a wide audience. I keep coming back to this founding premise of API Evangelist&nbsp;and work hard to write about 101, and 201 level concepts, despite definitely being a card carrying member of the core API community.</p>
<p>There are a number of leading-edge topics in the space right now from hypermedia to GraphQL, as well as leading edge implementations like bot and voice enablement, but should we be careful to not focus too heavily on these leading issues, and make sure we all invest in new users education as well. I'm feeling like we should keep a core academic group focusing on the big issues, but also enlist armies of folks to help translate down the food chain.</p>
<p>I do not feel there is a right answer to this question. You ask me on separate days, I will answer differently. Sometimes the topics that push forward the API conversation seems most important, but then sometimes educating the developer masses, and the average business users about APIs seems like what will truly push forward the conversation. Even with my flip-flopping, which is why I will never run for president, I think this topic is something we should ask ourselves regularly, and try to understand where we stand as time marches forward.</p>

        <span class="post-date">20 Oct 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2016_10_19_at_4.41.44_pm.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>While it can be easy to bash on API providers for being tight with their API resources, it can be very difficult to be an API provider operating in today's online environment. Some developers are just badly behaved and hold some pretty unrealistic expectations when it comes to opening up access to valuable content, data, and algorithms.</p>
<p>This is why I work to be supportive of providers when locking down their API resources, as long as they do it a constructive way. One positive approach I came across recently was from <a href="https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com/signup">the Oxford Dictionaries API</a>, who ask a lot of questions as part of their API signup form, but I felt it was a positive experience, and provided no barriers to me gaining access to their valuable API resources.</p>
<p>They asked me details about what type of application I'm developing, as well as the platform and language I am employing--allowing me to provide a summary of what it was I would be doing. They provide me with a summary of the terms of service, and the ability to opt into a platform email list, and they also let me know that they will not be selling my personal details to third parties.</p>
<p>I have never been a fan of lengthy API signup forms, as I tend to feel like I'm just a lead in their sales funnel, but this left me feeling the opposite. The Oxford Dictionary API signup form felt more like it was about making sure everyone was informed&nbsp;and in the service of protecting valuable API assets. I'm a supporter of API providers requesting more details on what API developers are up to, as long as they do it in the right way. If you don't make me feel like I'm a criminal, that I'm just one of many users in your sales funnel, and that you are just looking to extract value from me, I'm more than happy to share more information about myself as I consider a deeper business relationship with you.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2016_10_19_at_9.04.43_pm.png" alt="" width="20%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I enjoy learning from the OpenAPI Specs of the API providers I track on. Just having an OpenAPI Spec present tells a lot about an API provider in my book, but the level of detail some providers put into their API definitions adds another level to this for me. While reviewing <a href="https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com/swagger/spec/public_doc_guest.json">the OpenAPI Spec for the Oxford Dictionaries API</a>, I noticed their robust usage of the OpenAPI Spec parameters definitions collection, which provides an interesting overview of the surface area of the API, augmenting the benefits brought to the table by the definitions collection of an APIs underlying data schema.</p>
<p>When you are defining each path for an API you can either define the parameters using each paths parameters, or you can add them to the overall parameters definition object, allowing them to be reused across all paths. This object provided me with a centralized place to learn about the parameters used when making calls to the Oxford Dictionary API, and I'm assuming it helped them be more organized in how they defined the surface area of their APIs.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2016_10_19_at_9.04.05_pm.png" alt="" width="20%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I can see how the processing of defining each path's parameters, and centrally organizing them for reuse can be a healthy thing. The more you lift yourself out of the individual&nbsp;definition&nbsp;of each path&nbsp;and consider the parameter patterns that have been used for other paths, the chances you will have a better view of the landscape will increase. I am optimistic about this OpenAPI Spec object, and curious about how it can be evolved as part of other conversation around GraphQL--something I'll work to understand better in the future.</p>

<p>I keep an eye on <a href="https://github.com/trending?since=weekly">things that are trending daily and weekly on Github</a>&nbsp;because it is a great way to discover new companies and individuals doing interesting things with APIs. While looking at this earlier this week I came across <a href="https://github.com/open-guides/og-aws">the open guide to Amazon Web Services</a>, a pretty robust, and well organized&nbsp;getting started guide to everything AWS.</p>
<p>Here is their description of this resource out of the leading cloud computing platform:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>A lot of information on AWS is already written. Most people learn AWS by reading a blog or a &ldquo;<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html">getting started guide</a>&rdquo; and referring to the&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/">standard AWS references</a>. Nonetheless, trustworthy and practical information and recommendations aren&rsquo;t easy to come by. AWS&rsquo;s own documentation is a great but sprawling resource few have time to read fully, and it doesn&rsquo;t include anything but official facts, so omits experiences of engineers. The information in blogs or&nbsp;<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/amazon-web-services">Stack Overflow</a>&nbsp;is also not consistently up to date.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>This guide is by and for engineers who use AWS. It aims to be a useful, living reference that consolidates links, tips, gotchas, and best practices. It arose from </em>discussion<em> and editing over beers by&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/open-guides/og-aws/blob/master/AUTHORS.md">several engineers</a>&nbsp;who have used AWS extensively.</em></p>
<p>I find it interesting when API providers invest in authoritative&nbsp;solutions like this, acknowledging the scattered and often out of date nature of blogs, QA sites, forums, and the wealth of other self-service resources available for APIs. Amazon is getting seriously organized with their approach to provider resources for developers--they have been doing this a while, and know where the pain points are.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Amazon's organized approach, the breaking down by service, and the usage of Github are all interesting things I think are worth noting as part of my research. AWS is a tough API pioneer to showcase because they have way more resources than the average API provider, but as one of the early leaders in the API&nbsp;space they possess some serious&nbsp;wisdom&nbsp;and practices that are worth emulating. I'll keep going through <a href="https://github.com/open-guides/og-aws">their open guide</a>, and see what other patterns I can extract and showcase&nbsp;so that my&nbsp;readers can consider.</p>

<p>I am going through <a href="https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com">the Oxford Dictionaries API</a>, learning about this valuable resource. Their onboarding process for registration, and learning about what the API does using interactive documentation, is very smooth. One of the things that really cuts the rough edges off learning about each API are the enums that are available for each path.</p>
<p>The parameters required for making calls to many of the paths, like language and country, have their enum values populated as part of <a href="https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com/swagger/spec/public_doc_guest.json">their API definition</a>. I look at numerous OpenAPI Specs in the course of my work&nbsp;and they rarely have values present for enum, providing critical default values for developers to use--eliminating some often serious frustration.</p>
<p>Not having the right values available when making even the simplest of API calls can be a significant point of friction when trying to get up and running using an API. While it may seem like a small thing, the work the <a href="https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com">Oxford Dictionaries API</a> team has put into this level of detail for their API definitions will go a long way towards making their API resources more accessible and usable.</p>

<p>I have a number of folks at companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies come to me saying that they want to do APIs, and they need some help. In many of these discussions, the first task centers around addressing the motivations behind this declaration and helping folks realize they are already doing APIs, they are just not doing it in any sort of coherent and organized fashion.</p>
<p>Any business, organization, institution and government agency is moving machine readable data between internal, and with external systems in 2016, for use in a variety of applications. This is just done in a variety of often proprietary, ad-hoc, data dump, and other approaches that are often dictated without any coherent vision. API does not always mean 100% REST, it is about establishing interfaces between systems for programmatic usage across a variety of applications--the trick is to do all of this in a simplified, standardized, consistent, and low-cost way modeled on what has been working for the web.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are already doing API. You need to identify all the different ways you are already exporting, importing, migrating, syncing, and putting data to work across operations and begin to establish a coherent roadmap and approach to communicating about all of this. Then get to work identifying where the opportunities for standardizing how everything is defined, how&nbsp;access is needed, and a baseline for communication around these critical integrations on an ongoing basis. It's not about whether we should do APIs or not, you are already there, it is how do start doing it in a more organized and coherent way.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/20/d3js-visualizations-using-yaml-and-jekyll/">I have been playing around with different ways of using Google Spreadsheet to drive YAML and JSON data to Jekyll data projects hosted as Github repositories</a>. It is an approach <a href="http://government.services.adopta.agency/">I started playing around with in Washington DC, while I was helping data stewards publish government services as JSON-LD</a>. It is something I've been playing around with lately using to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/20/d3js-visualizations-using-yaml-and-jekyll/">drive D3.js visualizations</a>&nbsp;and even <a href="https://kinlane.github.io/teh-jigz-up/two/">a comic book</a>.</p>
<p>There are couple of things going on here. First, you are managing machine-readable data using Google Spreadsheets, and publishing this data as two separate machine readable formats: JSON and YAML. When these formats are combined with the data capabilities of a Jekyll website hosted on Github Pages, it opens up some pretty interesting possibilities for using data to fuel some pretty fun things. Plus...no backend needed.</p>
<p>To push this approach forward I wanted to apply&nbsp;to managing <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification">OpenAPI Specs</a> that can be used across the API life cycle. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dDrCFm8C2jtAkTm4zw86YJeREyCs9Vq49dAQeLiTxtg/pubhtml">I pulled together a spreadsheet template for managing the details I need for an OpenAPI Spec</a>. Then I created a Github repository, forked my previous spreadsheet to YAML project, and modified it to <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist-tools/openapi-spec-google-spreadsheet-to-jekyll-github-yaml">pull data from a couple of worksheets in the Google Doc&nbsp;and publish as both JSON and YAML OpenAPI Spec</a>s.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://api-evangelist-tools.github.io/openapi-spec-google-spreadsheet-to-jekyll-github-yaml/">My OpenAPI Spec Google Sheet to YAML for use in a Jekyll project hosted on Github is just a prototype</a>. The results don't always validate, and I'm playing with different ways to represent and manage the data in the Google Sheet. It is a fun start though! I am going to keep working on it, and probably start a similar project for managing an APIs.json&nbsp;index using Google Sheets. When done right it might provide another way that non-developers can participate in the API design process, and apply OpenAPI Specs to other stops along the API life cycle like with API documentation, SDK generation, or testing and monitoring.</p>

<p>It is tough to keep a sustained fire burning in the world of technology, at the individual, organizational, and community level. I have been doing API Evangelist full time for six years, and it is no secret that I have had several moments where I've experienced a crisis of faith, and I do not doubt that there will be&nbsp;many more of these in my future--there is no perfect solution. It takes hard work, creativity, and a myriad of other considerations to keep going, stay energized, and keep other folks doing the same.</p>
<p>I have spent a great deal of time this fall thinking about all of the factors that influence me, and contribute to the fire burning, or acting as a flame retardant to me and the API space. When exploring these contributing factors, it is only logical we start with the external forces right? Because this all sucks because of everything external, aka all of you! Couldn't possibly be me?</p>
<p>So what are some of the external forces out there that contribute to the fire burning brightly, or possibly being dampened across API space are?</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>People Aren't Always Nice -</strong> For some reason, the Internet has brought the worst out in many of us. I personally feel this is the nature of technology -- it isn't human, and the more time you spend with it, the less human we are, and less empathy we will have for other people.</li>
<li><strong>Everyone Takes A Little -</strong> Until you've spent a great deal of time in the spotlight writing, speaking, or otherwise you don't fully grasp this one. Every person you talk to, every hand you shake, takes a little bit from you -- making it super critical for people to give back -- it all takes a toll, whether we acknowledge it or not.</li>
<li><strong>Few Ever Give Back -</strong> The general tone set by startup culture and VC investment is to take, take, take, and rarely give back. The number of people who want to pick your brain, take your open work, and not ever give anything in return is far greater than the people openly giving back, or acknowledging they should pay you for your time.</li>
<li><strong>Use &amp; Subscribe To Open Channels -</strong> Follow me on Twitter, and Medium. Subscribe to the Atom Feed and email newsletter. Support those people in the space who provide open channels of information by tuning in and engaging.</li>
<li><strong>Fork, Contribute &amp; Build Upon -</strong> When you fork someone's work plan on how you will contribute back, build upon, and cite their work. Don't just use open source, contribute back to it, and augment it with the value you bring to the table.</li>
<li><strong>Events Are Exhausting - </strong>Producing, organizing, and pulling of valuable events that focus on ideas over products are fucking hard, and you should support the open tech events you think contribute most to the tech space. Invest time, money, and your energy wherever you can afford it. I know your company demands you get the most out of your sponsorships, but step back and consider how you can give the most as part of your sponsorship as well.</li>
<li><strong>Where We Invest - </strong>95% of the investment in the APi space is into proprietary products, services, and technology. The other 10% is an equal investment in ideas, open concepts, specifications, definitions, and software. If companies do invest in "open" it is in name only, and not a true invest. Everyone suffers from this behavior, making the space pretty fucking business as usual--which is a fire that nobody wants to tend&nbsp;to for very long.</li>
<li><strong>Intellectual Property - </strong>Unhealthy views on IP lock up ideas. I'm not saying copyright, patents, and licensing shouldn't exist. I am saying that aggressive, greedy views will continue to act as a wet blanket when it comes APIs making a meaningful impact, and making the game pretty untenable for individuals.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>Next, up, what are some of the internal forces (aka my responsibility) that can contribute to the fire burning more brightly in the API space?</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Going To Burning Man -</strong> Yes burning man will reinvigorate you each year, but we have to find a way to establish a regular alter that we can burn on a regular basis, finding renewal on a regular basis without so much fucking dust involved.</li>
<li><strong>Eat Well -</strong> If we've learned anything over the last six years it is that man cannot live on pizza alone. Words of caution for you youngsters--eventually you will start falling apart, and this shit will break if you do not eat well.</li>
<li><strong>Alcohol -</strong> Drinking is fun&nbsp;and an important social lubricant, but it can also lead to some very bad behavior in real-time, as well as contributing to a multitude of other issues in life ranging from health to relationships.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Exercise -</strong> We just can't sit on our ass all the time, as much as we'd like to think we can. Again, this isn't a problem for the youngsters, but as we get on in life, it will catch up with you, and we are better off finding a way to work it in regularly.</li>
<li><strong>Family Time -</strong> Spending time with family is important. Too much travel, screen time and work all hurt this. Regularly check in on what is important when it comes to family. Even if it is just working on API integrations with your kids (did I tell you I'm doing a project with my daughter) -- woohoo!</li>
<li><strong>Creativity - </strong>Take time to invest in and move forward creative projects. All work and no play makes us all very fucking boring, and are not conducive to any flame burning. The less I invest in my creative side, the less productive I am in my regular work. As an individual and a business make sure there is the investment in creative projects and space.</li>
<li><strong>Money -</strong> Money is not everything, but making some is required. I've had several waves of $$ making good in my career, and it rarely ever brought me more happiness, and always brought me more concern. There is a lot of focus on VC investment, and showcasing the successful founders in the space. To keep a sustained fire burning we have to realize there is a lot more to all of this than just making money.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just some of the key external and internal forces contributing to the fire burning within me individually when it comes to APIs, and I also feel contribute the fire burning also across the community (which I am part of). Startup and VC investment success do not equal community and individual success. Rarely does a startup winning contribute to any single individual success, or the wider community being more vibrant, creative, and rich?&nbsp;You have a rare rock star founder, and always the wealth of corporate and brand success, but these do not make a fire burn brighter in the community. It might attract a few moths to the flame along the way but doesn't truly enrich everyone, and provide fuel for a sustained burn--it is about burning bright, fast, and hard, which aren't good for most of us humans.</p>
<p>I keep going as the API Evangelist because I'm interested in what I'm doing. I'm fulfilled by learning, writing, sharing, and building. I will keep going for another 10, 20, hopefully until the end of my life, because a real fire is truly burning--not because I met my sales goals, sold my startup, or reached API economy nirvana (that is API singularity). Most of the time I'm learning, I am being creative, and I've made more money than was required to pay my rent, my bills, and could eat well. More meetings. More projects. More handshakes. More money does not always nurture me, and keep the fire alive personally, or within the wider API community.</p>

        <span class="post-date">18 Oct 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/twitter_logo_blue.png" alt="" width="25%" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="http://branding.apievangelist.com/">API branding</a> is an area that I find to be contradictory in the space, with the loss of brand control being in the top concerns for companies when doing APIs, while simultaneously one of the most deficient areas of API operations, with most API providers have no branding guidance in their developer portal whatsoever. I think it is just one of those telling aspects of how dysfunctional many companies are, and how their concerns are out of alignment with reality, and where they are investing their resources.</p>
<p>Every API should have some sort of branding page or area for their API operations--<a href="http://apievangelist.com/branding-guidelines/">I even have a branding page</a>. ;-) If you are looking for a healthy example to consider as a baseline of your branding page, <a href="https://brand.twitter.com/">take a look at Twitters branding page</a>, which provides the essential building blocks you should be considering:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Simple URL </strong>- Something easy to find, easily indexed by search engines, even a subdomain like Twitter does.</li>
<li><strong>Logos &amp; Assets -</strong> Provide us with at least a logo for your company, if not a wealth of assets&nbsp;to put to use.</li>
<li><strong>Branding Guidelines -</strong> Offer up some structure, helping guide us, and show you've put some thought into branding.</li>
<li><strong>Link to Embeddables -</strong> If you have any buttons, badges, and widgets, point us to your embeddable resources.</li>
<li><strong>Link to Terms of Service -</strong> Provide us with a quick link to the terms of service as it applies to branding.</li>
<li><strong>Contact Information -</strong> Give me an email, or another channel for asking a question if I get confused at any time.</li>
</ul>
<p>I do not agree with all of Twitter's branding enforcement, but I respect that they have set a bar, and provide the ecosystem with guidance. At the very least, it makes sure all of us are using the latest logo, and when done right it can help encourage consistency across every integration that is putting API resources to work. I find it hard time respecting branding concerns from companies who don't have a dedicated branding resource area for me to consult.</p>
<p>When done right, APIs extend the reach of any brand. Think about Twitter and Facebook sharing, and other embeddables. Most API consumers are more than happy to help extend your brand, but we are going to be lazy, and ALWAYS need guidance&nbsp;and things to copy / paste. At the very least, make sure you have the minimum viable branding assets and guidance like Twitter does, it really is the minimum bar for any API operating out there, and should not be ignored.</p>

        <span class="post-date">18 Oct 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/bw_relevant.png" alt="" width="30%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I am working on a project with a 16-year-old young lady to extract and tell a story using the <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/">YouTube API</a>. I'm pretty excited about the project because the young lady happens to be my daughter Kaia Lane. If you've ever seen my API Blah Blah Blah t-shirt, you've seen her work. Historically she could care less about APIs, until recently when pulling data about one of her favorite YouTube stars came up--suddenly she is interested in learning more about APIs.</p>
<p>During regular chatting with my daughter, I shared a story <a href="http://polygraph.cool/kickstarter/">on&nbsp;the entire history of Kickstarter projects broken down by a city</a>. She is a little geeky and likes Kickstarter, so I figured I'd share the approach to telling stories with data, and said that if she ever wanted help telling a story like this using YouTube, Instagram, or another platform, that she should let me know. She came back to me a couple days later asking to learn more about how she could tell a story like this using data pulled from one of the YouTube stars she follows. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Ok. I have to stop there for a moment. My 16-year-old daughter&nbsp;just asked me to learn more about APIs. :-) As an old goofy dad who happens to be the API Evangelist, I am beside myself.</p>
<p>I'm not 100% sure where this project will go. Right now I'm just seeing what data I can pull on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/DanAndPhilGAMES">Dan &amp; Phil's video game YouTube channel</a>, and from there we'll talk more about what type of story we want to tell about their followers&nbsp;and get to work pulling and organizing the data we need. I couldn't think of a tougher audience to be trying to get her interested in APIs. She isn't going to care about APIs, wants to learn about APIs, let alone become proficient with APIs unless they are relevant and interesting to her world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not think this lesson is exclusive to teaching 16-year-olds about API. I think this applies to ANYONE potentially learning about APIs. I am a big fan of EVERONE learning about APIs because they are the plumbing that moves our bits and bytes around in our personal and professional worlds. The more we are aware and the more we know we can put APIs to work, the more successful we are going to be in our lives. I want EVERYONE to open up and learn about APIs for this reason, but I REALLY REALLY want my daughter to find success in this way.</p>
<p>Just something to consider, as we are trying to help key internal, essential partner and other public stakeholders understand the API potential. How can we present APIs in a way that is relevant and interesting? Otherwise, most people probably aren't going to care, and it will all just be API Blah Blah Blah!</p>

        <span class="post-date">18 Oct 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/bw_splitter.png" alt="" width="30%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was reading <a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/document-description-formats-web-apis">a virtual panel: document and description formats for web APIs</a>,&nbsp;and thought the conversation was very productive when it comes to helping bring the world of API documentation and definitions into better focus. I encounter daily reminders that folks do not see the many dimensions of API definitions, and the role they play in almost every stop along the life cycle. This virtual panel helps move this discussion forward for me, providing some clarification for when it comes to the separation between API definitions and API documentation.</p>
<p>One of the questions asked of the panels was "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Do you see API Documentation and Description formats as a single thing? Or multiple things?"</span> Which I found&nbsp;Zdenek Nemec (<a href="https://twitter.com/zdne">@zdne</a>) answer to be a great introduction for folks when it comes to understanding the importance of this separation:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>There are definitely two different things. But truth be told, the initial incentive for the use API description formats was definitely the vision of API documentation without much work. However, the tide is turning as more and more people are discovering the benefits of the upfront design, API contracts, and quick prototyping</em></p>
<p>Many people still see machine readable definitions as purely something that drives API documentation. OpenAPI Specs are just for deploying Swagger UI, and API Blueprint is just for using Apiary. When in reality, the why and how you are doing API definitions is much, much deeper. As Z from Apiary points out, it is key to the API design and prototyping process, and critical to establishing the API contract.</p>
<p>Realizing that crafting machine readable API definitions is not just about API documentation, and that it is essential to establishing a meaningful technical, business, and legal contract internally, with partners, and maybe the public, early on in this API life cycle is empowering. I would say that I didn't fully appreciate API design, and understanding the depth of it until I had OpenSpec providing me with a scaffolding to hang things on.</p>
<p>Anyways, <a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/document-description-formats-web-apis">it is a great conversation from some very smart folks over at InfoQ</a>, I recommend heading over and spending time absorbing it. I'm leaving open for a week and rereading until it all sinks in.</p>

<p>I look at a lot of websites for companies who are providing APIs and selling services to the API space. When I find a new company, I can spend upwards of 10 minutes looking for all the relevant information I need to connect. Elements like where their Twitter and Github accounts are. These are all the key channels I am looking for so that I can better understand what a company does and stay in tune with any activity, but they are also the same channels that developers will be looking for so that they can stay in tune a platform as well.</p>
<p>I spend a great deal of time looking for these channels, so I'm always happy when I find companies who provide a near complete set of icons for all the channels that matter. <a href="https://restlet.com/">Restlet, the API design, deployment, management,and&nbsp;testing&nbsp;platform</a>&nbsp;has a nice example of this in action, providing the following channels:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facebook</li>
<li>Twitter</li>
<li>Google+</li>
<li>LinkedIn</li>
<li>Vimeo</li>
<li>Slideshare</li>
<li>Github</li>
<li>Stack Overflow</li>
<li>Email</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these channels are available as orderly icons in the footer of their site. Making my job easier, and I'm sure making it easier for other would be API developers. They also provide an email newsletter signup along with the set of icons. While this provides me with a nice set of channels to tune into, more than I usually find, I would still like to have a blog and atom feed icons, as well as maybe an AngelList or Crunchbase, so that i can peak behind the business curtain a little.</p>
<p>I know. I know. I am demanding, and never happy. I am just trying to provide an easy checklist for companies looking to do interesting things APIs of the common channels they should consider offering. You should only offer up channels that you can keep active, but I recommend that you think about offering up as many of these as you possibly can manage. No matter which ones you choose, make sure you organize them all together, in the header and footer of your website, so nobody has to go looking for them.</p>

        <span class="post-date">18 Oct 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-contract.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>One of the reasons I write so much on API Evangelist is to refine how I tell stories about APIs and hopefully make a bigger impact by being more precise in what I'm saying. I feel like one of the reasons <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/10/12/we-understimated-the-time-it-would-take-for-hypermedia-to-be-absorbed/">why hypermedia API concepts have to take longer than we anticipated to spread</a> is because many (not all) of the hypermedia elite suck at telling stories. I am sorry, but you have done a shit job selling the importance of hypermedia, and often times were just confrontational and turning many folks off to the subject.</p>
<p>I am working on playing around with telling different stories about hypermedia, hoping to soften some of the sharp edges of the hypermedia stories we tell. One of the core elements of hypermedia APIs is they provide us with links as part of each API response, emulating much of what works with the web, in the system to system, and application layers of the web. One of the benefits of these links is they help facilitate&nbsp;the evolution and change that is inevitable in our API infrastructure.</p>
<p>The default argument&nbsp;for hypermedia folk is often about versioning&nbsp;and change-resistant API clients. I'm looking to help make these concepts more human, and that employing hypermedia&nbsp;as part of our API contracts is more about providing an honest and flexible view of the business relationship we are entering into. As API provider and consumer, we are acknowledging that there will be change and evolution in the resources that are being delivered, and being more honest that this exists, as we craft this API contract.</p>
<p>As an API provider I am not just going to dump this JSON product response on you, and expect you to know what to do, refusing to have a discussion with my consumers that this product will change. it might be out of inventory, and might be replaced by another product, and any number of evolution changes that may occur in the normal course of business. Hypermedia gives me a framework to acknowledge that this will indeed evolve upon entering our agreed&nbsp;upon API contract, and provide a channel for all integrated API clients to receive future instructions about what is possible when things do change--our API contract is flexible.</p>
<p>As an API provider, when I share this machine-readable representation of my product I'm not just assuming you know you can add it to the cart, or to a wish list, I am providing you with the links to do this, and the link relations that define this relationship. As things change and evolve, I have a way to share other opportunities, and changes to this business contract. When a product is recalled, there is a link routing you to what you need. When a product is replaced, you are routed to what you need. As an API provider, I'm committed to providing you with what you need to be successful when putting API resources to work.</p>
<p>Hypermedia goes being just providing links, managing versioning, and ensuring more resilient API clients--a very technical story. Hypermedia gives us a more honest and flexible way to define the API business contracts we are entering into when we make API resources available internally, with partners, and even with the public at large. Change is inevitable, and I feel like we need to be more honest about this change and be less rigid in how we are doing things, and I keep coming back to hypermedia as a meaningful way we can make this happen.</p>
