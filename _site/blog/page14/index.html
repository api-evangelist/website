<p>As I was writing up a story on Mailjet tweeting out the iPaaS opportunities around their&nbsp;email API, <a href="https://twitter.com/mailjet/">I noticed their Twitter bio</a>. It is subtle, but having spent a great deal of time looking for the support channels for an API, this is a potentially huge time saver. It is what I do best, discovering these simple, subtle things that the successful API providers are doing.</p>
<p>I always encourage API providers to use Twitter as a support channel&nbsp;because it doesn't just provide support, it also is a public demonstration that you give a shit about your API consumers, and will actively work to help them solve their problems. I've seen APIs who offer no support, or a minimal number of support channels, while also seemingly&nbsp;working very hard to hide them--leaving you feeling like you will never get help when you need it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mailjet.com/">Mailjet</a> provides links to their status page, as well as a link where you can submit a trouble ticket in their Twitter bio. I would consider their Twitter bio pretty well crafted with the first half explaining what they do(for new users), and the second half providing information on how to get support(for existing users). It is a subtle, positive thing that all API providers should consider doing--thanks for the lead Mailjet.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-spreadsheet-to-json.png" alt="" width="30%" align="right" /></p>
<p>In September of 2015, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/09/08/when-are-we-going-to-get-a-save-as-json-in-our-spreadsheets/">I asked when are we going to get a save as JSON in our spreadsheets</a>? I was doing a lot of work saving spreadsheets as CSV files, something I can easily do programmatically, but I was doing it manually as part of a workshop. After I downloaded each CSV file, I then <a href="http://kinlane.github.io/csv-converter/">converted to a JSON file</a>--leaving me asking, "where is the save as JSON"?</p>
<p>As I've been reviewing new <a href="https://dev.office.com/excel/rest">Microsoft's Excel API</a>, I got to thinking about the need for a save as JSON option, and now I think that this line of thought was not forward thinking enough. A "save as" just does not speak to the future of machine readable spreadsheet interactions in an online world. Save as CSV, TSV, are very desktop oriented visions of using Excel, and in 2016 we need more.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.office.com/excel/rest">Microsoft's Excel API</a>&nbsp;plus OAuth&nbsp;opens up an endless number of opportunities for working with data available in spreadsheets. Microsoft will have to open up the navigation in the online version of Microsoft Excel to the API developer community, allowing for users to subscribe to 3rd party API driven&nbsp;solutions like, save as JSON, open in Github as CSV, visualize with D3.js, and anything else that developers dream up via the Microsoft Excel API.</p>
<p>Maybe this is already possible in the Microsoft Excel online navigation, regardless, there will also be opportunities for extending these options via browser add-ons, as well as integration directly within 3rd party solutions, that use OAuth and the Microsoft Excel API to access valuable data that is locked up in spreadsheets. I enjoy that APIs are constantly pushing me to re-evaluate my legacy ways of thinking, and help me look more towards the future.</p>

<p>I work as hard as I can to understand every sector being opened up using web APIs, and the network level is one that I need to push my awareness&nbsp;of, partially because I find it interesting, but mostly because of the impact it can have on every other aspect of how the Internet works (or doesn't).</p>
<p>To get started I went over to Cisco Devnet, and <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/site/pxgrid/">took a look at their pxGrid solution</a>, which is a "multivendor, cross-platform network system that pulls together different parts of an IT infrastructure such as security monitoring and detection systems, network policy platforms, asset and configuration management, identity and access management platforms", which provides "you with an API that will open up a unified framework that will enable you to integrate to pxGrid once, then share context with any other platform that supports pxGrid".&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd categorize pxGrid as&nbsp;network&nbsp;API aggregator in my world, providing a single, seamless API to access resources at the network level. Of course, all the network endpoints have to speak pxGrid, but the platform provides me with an introductory blueprint for how web APIs are being applied to network resources, for device configuration and management, as well as identity and security services. I'm not a network professional, but I do know that Cisco devices are pretty ubiquitous, and with the company historically having over 50% market share, I'm betting it is a&nbsp;good place to kick off my learning.</p>

        <span class="post-date">18 Aug 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-reciprocity2.png" alt="" width="30%" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/02/27/merging-api-automation-and-interoperability-into-api-reciprocity/">Early on in 2013, I started a research project to keep an eye on a specific type of API driven service provider, like IFTTT and Zapier, who were enabling individuals and businesses to move data around in the cloud</a>. This new wave of startups was moving from what we traditionally called ETL in the enterprise, which was about extracting, transforming, and loading data between various systems, into the cloud era.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm an old enterprise database guy, and ETL has been an essential tool in my toolbox for quite some time--<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load">according to Wikipedia ETL</a> is:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) refers to a process in database usage and especially in data warehousing that performs: Data extraction &ndash; extracts data from homogeneous or heterogeneous data sources.</em></p>
<p>The IT teams that I have historically been a part of have employed ETL to make sure data was where it was needed within the enterprise. As IT began its evolution to the web, the need to migrate data between systems outside the firewall increased. We were increasingly extracting, transforming, and loading data via FTP, web services, and web APIs outside the firewall, and even migrating data between systems that exclusively existed in the cloud.</p>
<p>Increasingly the data we were migrating was using web APIs&nbsp;and began employing a more granular approach to how authentication occurred for each "extract and load"--oAuth. With the growth of shadow IT, and the adoption of software as a service (SaaS) solutions, individuals, and businesses were needing to move documents, media, and other vital data or content between the cloud services which we were increasingly depending on.</p>
<p>APIs were enabling savvy tech users to migrate and sync their data between systems, and startups like IFTTT and Zapier saw the opportunity and jumped in with their new offerings. I do not talk about IFTTT, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/20/why-i-am-continuing-to-integrate-zapier-in-my-business-workflow/">as they choose to not pay all of this forward by offering an API</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/31/hello-pinboard-customers-from-linden-tibbets-the-ceo-of-ifttt/">also opt to ignore the transparency that APIs bring to the table</a>--so I will simply refer to Zapier as my example of this new breed of service provider. ;-)&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to evolving beyond FTP and ODBC as the primary channels, and being about the migration of information in the cloud, the other significant characteristic that stood out for me, is this new approach was also paying attention to the individual needs of stakeholders, owners, and the people who the migration of information was important to. This information was also increasingly being migrated between multiple systems&nbsp;and adhering to the terms of service, as well as the privacy of each party involved.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/02/27/merging-api-automation-and-interoperability-into-api-reciprocity/">When I launched my research back in 2013, I called it reciprocity</a>, which the dictionary defined as:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>the quality or state of being reciprocal : mutual dependence, action, or influence</li>
<li>a mutual exchange of privileges; specifically : a recognition by one of two countries or institutions of the validity of licenses or privileges granted by the other</li>
</ul>
<p>When I looked in the thesaurus, reciprocity also had a definition of "interchange" with synonyms of cooperation, exchange, mutuality and reciprocation. Reciprocity is also a synonym of connection with a definition of &ldquo;person who aids another in achieving goal&rdquo;. With synonyms being an acquaintance, agent, ally, associate, association, contact, friend, go-between, intermediary, kin, kindred, kinship, mentor, messenger, network, reciprocity, relation, relative, and sponsor.</p>
<p>All of these terms apply to what I was seeing unfold with this new generation of ETL providers. ETL was moving into the clouds, and out from behind the firewall, using the open web, cloud platforms and APIs, and now we have to&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/02/10/bringing-etl-to-the-masses-with-apis/">rethink ETL, and make it accessible to the masses</a>--putting it within reach of the everyday problem owners.</p>
<p>After three years, as I've seen this area continue to grow, but the growth in my website traffic to this research was not in alignment with what I saw in other areas. Over time I realized the area had been dubbed integration platform as a service (iPaaS), and while I have resisted using this term for a while, as I was wanting to emphasize the human aspect of this, I am now giving in. Reciprocity was the only term I have ever tried to push on the API community&nbsp;and have to admit it will be the last term or phrase I ever try to brand in this way.</p>
<p>Sadly iPaaS has become the leading acronym to talk about this evolution, and because IT vendors and analysts couldn't give a shit about the users who's information is being moved around, they have defined it simply as:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Integration Platform as a Service (iPaaS) is a suite of cloud services enabling development, execution and governance of integration </em>flow<em> connecting any combination of on premises and cloud-based processes, services, applications and data within the </em>individual<em> or across multiple organizations.</em></p>
<p>In classic IT fashion, no emphasis has been placed on the humans in this equation. In the early days of web APIs, startups had focused on what the people who were using their solution needed. Then with each wave of VC investment into the space,&nbsp;with enterprise vendors shifting their focus to this new world, and the industry analyst pundits realizing the value that lies in this new era, we are going back to the old ways of thinking about IT--one that rarely ever focuses on the human aspect of the bits and bytes we are shuffling around.</p>
<p>I am losing this same fight in almost every area of the API space that I keep an eye on. I'm not naive to think I can cut through the noise of the space, and truly take on the IT and developer class's obsessive belief in technology, and the blindness that comes from a focus on the money, but I do believe I can at least influence some of the conversations. This is why I'll keep trying to make sure there is reciprocity across the API space, and iPaaS pays attention to the human aspect of integration, migration, and keeping our increasingly online world in sync.</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Aug 2016</span>
        <p><a href="https://zapier.com/zapbook/excel/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/Excel_Integrations_-_Zapbook_-_Zapier.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I have been finding quite a few nuggets of wisdom out of <a href="https://blogs.office.com/2016/08/03/announcing-the-general-availability-of-the-microsoft-excel-api-to-expand-the-power-of-office-365/">the&nbsp;recent release of the Microsoft Excel API</a>. This is what I enjoy doing as the API Evangelist, evaluate and gather any positive or negative activities performed by the leading API players, craft blog posts in hopes that other API providers will read, enabling them be more successful in their own API operations.</p>
<p>As part of my monitoring, I am also looking for significant trends that may reflect other wider industry opportunities, beyond any individual API. I am always telling API providers to think about integrating iPaaS solutions like Zapier into their operations as early as possible, and I think Microsoft's acknowledgment in their release emphasizes the importance of iPaaS.</p>
<p>Here is the language, directly out of Microsoft's release post:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><img class="alignleft wp-image-223825" src="https://blogs.office.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/zapier.png" alt="zapier" width="150" height="68" /><span>Zapier lets users easily automate tedious tasks. Zapier recently announced a new&nbsp;</span><a href="https://zapier.com/zapbook/excel/" target="_blank">Excel integration</a><span>, powered by Excel REST API, with near-infinite use cases, like simplifying a data collection process. Users can now build zaps where data is automatically added into Excel from other services, like emails and surveys, making Excel the data repository for all your connected services.</span></p>
<p><span>I am guessing that Microsoft Excel API team did their homework, and saw the number of Google Sheet integrations available on Zapier. When it comes to integration platform as a service, being able to take data, content, and other resources and put it into a spreadsheet, has to be in the top 10 of use case scenarios. Moving the bits and bytes we are creating on the web daily, and making available via the familiar spreadsheet UI, is increasingly how business gets done on the ground at the average organization.</span></p>
<p>I guess there are two nuggets here for my API provider audience: 1) iPaaS, and specifically Zapier integration is growing important 2) Making sure your API is available as Zapier integration with Excel and Google spreadsheets might be something else you will want to consider too!</p>

<p><a href="https://blogs.office.com/2016/08/03/announcing-the-general-availability-of-the-microsoft-excel-api-to-expand-the-power-of-office-365/">I am pretty impressed with the casual release of the Microsoft Excel API</a>, which I think is <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/10/the-release-of-the-microsoft-excel-api-is-a-pretty-significant-milestone/">a pretty significant milestone for the world of APIs</a>. One of the subtle elements of their API release that I think is worth noting, is the support flow they provide. Here is the actual text from the release blog post for the Excel API:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"Give us your feedback on the API and documentation through&nbsp;<a href="http://graph.microsoft.io/en-us/docs/api-reference/v1.0/resources/excel" target="_blank">GitHub</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/microsoftgraph" target="_blank">Stack Overflow</a>, or make new feature suggestions on&nbsp;<a href="http://officespdev.uservoice.com/" target="_blank">UserVoice</a>."</em></p>
<p>This is the most open, and casual I think I've seen Microsoft ever be. They are allowing the community to suggest edits to their API documentation using Github, encouraging the conversation on their own forum, as well as outside their ecosystem, on Stack Overflow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know. Maybe I'm reading too much into it. They just seem like they are getting better with each API they have released, and the Excel API release was much more casual, natural, and less rigid than I'm used to from Microsoft.</p>
<p>I can't speak to the technical design of each endpoint yet, as I haven't played with enough, but the overall experience of <a href="https://dev.office.com/">the Microsoft Office Dev Center</a> is surprisingly modern, simple, and intuitive. There are still a lot of places where it feels like a knowledgebase&nbsp;and not an API community, but overall it exceeds what I'm used to from Microsoft when it comes to APIs.</p>
<p>I have to admit, I didn't hold out much hope for Microsoft when it came to catching up on cloud and APIs--something that is changing with each API they release.</p>

Sometimes I will drop people a line and ask if they have one, or let them know it would be very useful to have an RSS feed easy to find. This is also a topic I write about regularly to help remind folks that RSS is&nbsp;not dead.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Almost every time I write about the topic I get a handful of people who tell me you don't need RSS anymore, you just tweet out your blog posts--nobody uses RSS readers after Google Reader went away. While it might be true that some folks have abandoned their feed readers, I think they were casual readers in the first place, and serious analysts still very much depend on RSS.</p>
<p>I wish I could help folks understand the power they are giving away to Twitter by thinking like this. I am happy to share a piece of my digital self with Twitter, but as with all platforms I use, I will be considering at every turn the benefit or damage to my own brand. RSS from your blog, at your domain, strengthens your brand and puts you in control of the syndication.</p>
<p>You can still use services like Zapier to take each new RSS entry and automatically Tweet out--you don't have to relinquish control of distribution to Twitter. This is the dangers of these platforms, every platform wants you to spend as much time generating content and media on their platform. This is how they make money, off your activity and hard work--please don't give it up for free, or at the cost of your own brand.</p>
<p>If you are a professional, and expect to make a living from your business, products, services, and brand--you need to maximize the control, licensing, and distribution of your content--give up only what you need. There is no reason to make a deal with Twitter that exclusively gives them full control over your syndication.&nbsp;RSS and API should always be your primary content distribution channel, and Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and others should follow after that.</p>

<p>I've heard of numerous API providers shutting down their API programs after a couple months because they didn't see the number of new users, and integrations they had hoped for. It is so easy for us technologists to shoot for the moon, while also simultaneously shooting ourselves in the foot&nbsp;when it comes to defining where the bar should be for our operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember, we are not all Twilio. For most of us our API will never be our primary product, and operating it will be less than a glorious affair--meaning you will never be written up in Techcrunch ;-). We are entering into the really mundane, business as usual phase of the API industry, and things will not be as exciting or sexy as they have been, and we need to make sure our APIs stay real, and reliable amidst all of the tech delusions we have on a regular basis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even if your API is not the next amazing tech sensation, it doesn't mean you can't operate following the lead of the giants like Twilio, Amazon, and Google. You can run a first class shop, even if you don't make the front page of Reddit for the launch, and get all the hacker kids building amazingly cool stuff in the first weeks. To do this you need to set some realistic goals for operations, that aren't based on the often fantasy world of Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>It is likely your company's website wasn't a major hit when it first launched either, and you didn't ditch it because it was underperforming. I'm guessing your goals were probably a little more realistic, and in alignment with your primary business objectives. Your API is no different than your web efforts, it will take time to do it properly, and probably require a few adjustments along the way--do not give up before you have a chance to find success.</p>

<p>At any point in time, there are numerous emails in my inbox, LinkedIn messages, and DMS, asking me if I would "just jump on the phone to discuss the latest" about an API. I get a regular stream of these, which makes it pretty impossible for me to actually make time to do, and if I did make time to talk to each of these API providers, I wouldn't have time to actually write up stories and guides for my site.</p>
<p>I'm sure it can be frustrating for folks who just want to share the latest with me, but I hope you will understand that I am just a one man show, and I have to prioritize. I recommend that you also get better at managing your time, and write up each of the things you wanted to talk to me about as a blog post, and then share out via your API platform's Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook (you have all those right?).&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not a fan of being the recipient of embargoed or top-secret information, as EVERYTHING I do tends to be very public. If you publish your&nbsp;information&nbsp;as a blog post, it is much more likely that I will see it, and read it, than I will if it is an email. Plus you get the bonus of me being able to share out the link, and the wider API community getting to learn about it as well. It is just way more efficient for you to tell your story publicly&nbsp;than it is for us to jump on the phone--for both of us.</p>
<p>Handling yourself this way will continue to pay dividends, as the chances, I will write about something in the future increases if I have the link bookmarked--something that will rarely happen if we talk about on the phone. This played out in my story on the role API definitions are playing with API integrations, where I linked to&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.clearbit.com/introducing-the-run-in-postman-button/">Clearbit</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cronofy.com/blog/how-adding-the-run-in-postman-button-changed-our-api/">Cronofy</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/best-buy-developers/building-api-lists-with-the-run-in-postman-button-53c8a22c1d9c#.r0amcganq">Best Buy</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sparkpost.com/blog/how-to-run-sparkpost-postman/#.V7NDpJMrKuU">SparkPost</a>&nbsp;stories on their release of Run in Post Buttons. If they didn't tell the story on their blog, I would never have had a link to share in that story, and now this story--bonus two separate posts on API Evangelist, just because they had the forethought to tell the story of what they did.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Aug 2016</span>
        <p><a href="http://developer.opto22.com/static/generated/pac-rest-api/swagger-ui/index.html#/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/pcbased_io_320x224.jpg" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I was learning more about <a href="http://developer.opto22.com/static/generated/pac-rest-api/swagger-ui/index.html#/">the Programmable Automation Controller (PAC) API</a> from <a href="http://www.opto22.com/">Opto 22</a> and fouind myself intrigued by their usage of the word strategy to describe the role a web API can play when it comes to making the industrial automation process more programmable. I'd say the over API design is still very rough and represents the engineer's view of a PAC, but the potential for industrial IoT strategy orchestration is still present.</p>
<p>I'm learning about PAC APIs through the lens of my drone API research, where the role an API can play in the devices strategy creation, as well as execution. Meaning, with a drone, I can use the API to get at the data from one or many drone flights, as well as use the data, then the API again, to help me execute on the strategy. When this line of thought is applied in an industrial setting, the potential for an API driven strategy increases pretty dramatically.</p>
<p>A PAC API takes this strategy concept further down the road for me than it did with the drone alone. Each PAC can have its own DNS, and its own API, and the overall&nbsp;industrial process I am building a strategy for might contain many different PACS--allowing me to orchestrate in&nbsp;an unlimited number of industrial scenarios. I guess the API surface area for a PAC-enabled industrial workflow expands, contracts, and communicates very differently than it has for a single drone or even a drone fleet. I will have to take what I've learned from PACs and apply to drones.</p>
<p>This is the part of my API Evangelist existence I enjoy the most--the cross-pollination between the different sectors I am learning about.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Aug 2016</span>
        <p><a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-commons/api-commons-icon.png" alt="" width="30%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>As the debate over <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-commons/api-commons-icon.png">whether you need an SDK for your API or not</a>&nbsp;has rumbled over the last couple of years, API specification formats like OpenAPI Spec, Postman, and API Blueprint have been gaining traction. As this has progressed, I've asked myself several times whether or not API providers even need SDKs anymore. Not just because of the complexities of developing and maintaining, but because more developers are using web clients like Postman and DHC to evolve their integrations.</p>
<p>Apigee Explorer and Swagger UI documentation demonstrated that many developers needed to play with an API as they were learning about what resources were available, and how to use them. I think the evolution of API clients like Postman, DHC, PAW, and others have shown that this phase of playing, exploration, and non-code integration can go well beyond just integration&nbsp;and should actually be neverending across stops along the API life cycle.</p>
<p>It is just anecdotal at the moment, but looking at the API providers who have embedded the Get Postman Button on their sites like <a href="http://blog.clearbit.com/introducing-the-run-in-postman-button/">Clearbit</a>, <a href="https://www.cronofy.com/blog/how-adding-the-run-in-postman-button-changed-our-api/">Cronofy</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/best-buy-developers/building-api-lists-with-the-run-in-postman-button-53c8a22c1d9c#.r0amcganq">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://www.sparkpost.com/blog/how-to-run-sparkpost-postman/#.V7NDpJMrKuU">SparkPost</a>, it seems to me that having your API definition available for your developers is growing more important than having SDKs. Developers are getting more traction by loading the Postman Collection, and other common specification format into their client, testing, and other tooling, than they are cracking open the language library of their choice.</p>
<p>This is something I'll further validate through my research. One critique I have on this, is I'm seeing the benefits of this approach focus around Postman, which I'm a big fan of, and a user, but represents just a handful of stops along the API life cycle (client, testing), and not the wider spectrum that OpenAPI Spec and API Blueprint would offer. I have yet to see any of these formats <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/12/19/button-to-run-this-api-in-the-http-api-client-of-my-choice/">follow my advice like Postman </a><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/12/19/button-to-run-this-api-in-the-http-api-client-of-my-choice/">did</a>&nbsp;and get to work on an embeddable solution for OpenAPI Spec and API Blueprint--giving Postman a significant headstart.</p>
<p>API providers need to be openly sharing their API definitions, API service providers need to be allowing for the run in, and import using the common API specification formats, and developers need to be fluent in these formats and functionality, as they will play an important role in the evolution of the space--one that I think will be more significant than the role SDKs have played, after this plays out.</p>

<p>When you hear about the Internet of Things (IoT) you often hear about the hopeful consumer side of thing, like with Nest thermostat, and the next wave of Internet-connected devices that will change our personal worlds forever. Personally, when I think about the concept of Internet-connected devices actually seeing adoption, and getting traction, I think of it being applied in an industrial setting.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://info.opto22.com/snap-pac-rest-api-thank-you">The RESTful&nbsp;programmable automation controllers (PACs) APIs out of Opto 22 resemble this vision of IoT which I have in my head</a>. APIs making everyday objects used in a variety of industrial processes, programmable, and accessible over wired or wireless networks. Making everything from manufacturing&nbsp;to water and energy facilities more automated and efficient, while potentially generated data that can be used to monitor, and optimize these industrial workflows--this is IoT.</p>
<p>The dream of home automation just doesn't do it for me. I just don't buy the Jetsons vision of the home, but I can buy into the potential for IoT making the industrial processes which we depend on to make our world operate more efficient. Consumer IoT seems like a bandwagon to me, but proven industrial equipment manufacturers like <a href="http://info.opto22.com/snap-pac-rest-api-thank-you">Opto 22 realizing the potential of web API infrastructure</a>, and baking it into the devices they manufacture, seems like real world IoT business to me.</p>

I get it, the space needs new concepts to rally around, and I'm the first to admit even the concept of an API is bullshit, but when people say serverless, it always makes me chuckle--especially when people work so hard to sell it (who am I to make fun of that).</p>
<p>Often when I come across a serverless solution, it is often bundled with the phrase "100% serverless", a description which usually then contains the 2-6 vendor solutions used to deploy said serverless solution. I know there is no use in pointing out there are always servers behind serverless solutions, but can I at least point out the vendor dependencies involved? Are the vendor dependencies better or worse than our dependencies on servers (that never went away)? IDK. WTF. BBQ.</p>

<p>Being able to provide different levels of access for a single API has been one of the telltale characteristics of any modern web API. Savvy API providers know they don't just make their valuable API resources publicly available for anyone to use, they know you can craft a logical set of plans that are in alignment with your wider business objectives, outlining how any developer can put an API to use--this is the essential&nbsp;business of APIs.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/06/10/history-of-apis-mashery/">Mashery was the first API management provider to standardize this approach to API access</a>, something further evolved by 3Scale, Apigee, and others. Amazon's release of their API gateway wove API management into the fabric of what we call the cloud, and the introduction of usage plans, does the same for API service composition. Making the identification, metering, limiting, and monetization of resources made available via APIs, a default function of operations in the cloud.</p>
<p>Being able to take any digital asset, whether it is data, content, or an algorithmic resource, and make available via a URL, and control who has access, while also metering their usage, and charging different rates for this usage, is where the business of APIs rubber meets the road. API service composition lets you dial in exactly the right levels of access, and usage, required to fulfill a business contract, delivering precisely the service that customers are wanting for their&nbsp;web, mobile, and device apps.</p>
<p>It's taken a decade for this key element of doing business on the web to mature beyond just a handful of vendors, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/05/taking-a-fresh-look-at-what-open-source-api-management-architecture-is-available/">then into an assortment of open source solutions</a>, and now something that is just baked into what we know as the cloud--allowing us to plan API access consistently and universally across all the digital resources we are increasingly storing and operating in the cloud.</p>

<p>I was going through the getting started pages for the APIs that I keep an eye on, pulling together an outline of what I'd consider to be some of the best elements across all the API providers.

<p>Constant Contact's approach to their getting started page has given me a good start for my outline, including essential links to setup your account, create a new application and get your keys. Constant Contact also provides required documentation, an API tester, and supporting code libraries. Additionally, they encourage you to certify your integration as a partner and get published in their integration marketplace--providing a pretty well thought out getting started page in my opinion.</p>
<p>I am going to take what I've learned here, and craft a sample getting started page for my minimum viable API portal definition. I'm sure some of you are snickering at me paying attention to API operations at this level of detail, but I wouldn't underestimate the ability of a well crafted API getting started page to reduce friction with developers. I want to give API providers with a simple template they can follow when publishing a getting started page.</p>
<p>With the next release of my API portal, I'll have a good example of a getting started page, which will be heavily influenced by <a href="http://developer.constantcontact.com/">Constant Contac</a>t.</p>

<p>I am all about marking down the important milestones that help define the API sector. It is what I've been working to define as my <a href="http://history.apievangelist.com/">history of the web APIs</a>&nbsp;for the last six years. An API has to make its mark in pretty big way before I'll add as an official milestone in my version of the last 17 years of the web APIs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll give it some time, but I'm thinking the recently released <a href="https://dev.office.com/excel/rest">Excel API from Microsoft</a> is going to get added pretty quickly. I think the next five years of API evolution is going to be much less exciting than the previous five years, with numerous small businesses publishing their valuable data, content, and <a href="https://xkcd.com/1667/">complex algorithms</a> via the Excel API.</p>
<p>This stage of API deployment won't be filled with API heroes like Amazon, and Twilio, but will still make a seismic shift in the landscape just through the pure volume of data that is made available--we won't be able to keep up. I don't think all the DB to API connectors collectively add up to the number of spreadsheet-driven data, content, algorithmic, and visualizations that will be driving business decisions out there in the future.</p>
<p>I am not a diehard fan of the spreadsheet, as I'm a database guy, but in my 25+ year career, there is no single more important business tool out there than the spreadsheet. <a href="https://dev.office.com/excel/rest">Giving Excel native API capabilities by default</a> will dramatically increase the number of high-value APIs available. It will be something that I cannot ignore, and will have to do some playing around with the API, to see what is possible.</p>

        <p><a href="https://slack.com/developers/fund"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/Slack_Fund.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The messaging platform&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/launch-platform-114754258b91#.kd3av5fl2">Slack made waves when they launched</a> their <a href="https://slack.com/developers/fund">Slack Fund</a> as part of their API release, putting up $80M to invest in developers who were interested in building cool things on the API. <a href="https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/investing-in-the-future-of-work-d4ffb87f985#.qhvdsad0h">Slack has continued telling their story</a>, talking about how they have invested some of the fund and are being pretty transparent about which API integrations made the cut.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After reading about the Slack Fund I wanted to see which other APIs were investing in their communities like this. Next, I came across the <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-fund">Alexa Fund where Amazon is investing in developers building voice-enabled apps</a>, giving their Echo platform the boost of applications it will need to find success. After poking around the AWS platform, you also find they have also had their <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/grants/">AWS Grants program</a>, investing in the best of breed projects that use the AWS platform to give back to the world.</p>
<p>I came across a number of other fund announcements about available funds, only to find the pages gone, but MailChimp had an interesting accounting of their fund which they started in November of 2010, pledging $1M to "provide developers with funding assistance to build integrations on our email platform". I also found <a href="https://developer.ciscospark.com/fund/- https://developer.ciscospark.com/fund/">another fund developer fund out of Cisco</a>, to encourage development with&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.ciscospark.com/">Cisco Spark</a><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><a href="https://tropo.com/">Tropo</a>, and the other APIs they provide at<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://developer.cisco.com/">Cisco DevNet</a>, that was noteworthy.</p>
<p>There are not enough examples of API investment funds out there for me to add the concepts as what I'd consider being a common API building block, but there are enough out there, especially from leading pioneers, to keep me paying attention. API developer funds don't seem like something you have to go as big as AWS or Slack did, but it seems to me, if you provide a small fund like MailChimp did, it could incentivize development significantly--at least make your launch be fewer crickets.</p>

<p>I am always looking for simple advice I can give to API providers to make their developers and would-be developers integration as friction-less as possible. When it comes to making the code available for your API I recommend providing a wealth of samples, libraries, and full blown SDKs for your developers. Also make sure these code resources are as easy to find within your developer portal, as well as being openly licensed and available on your API platform's Github profile.</p>
<p>Adding to this advice I would also recommend that you take the top 10 programming languages and platforms out there, and perform a quick Google search for the key phrase, and see what comes up, on a regular basis. I tend to find interesting conversations around an API when I do this. Inversely it can also provide some interesting signals that an API isn't very active within specific communities, and there probably isn't much existing support.</p>
<p>For me, searching for API [name] + [programming language] or [platform name] = some interesting reflections of activity around an API. I can also imagine that this would provide a way for API providers to learn where the gaps in their outreach are, and give them another way to reach their developers or potential developers--demonstrating that SEO plays a significant&nbsp;role in successful API operations.</p>

<p>I am still learning about the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/sirikit/">recent API release out of Apple</a>, and working to keep up with <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/alexa">the volume of resources coming out of the Amazon Alexa ecosystem</a>, but one thing I know for sure is Amazon is way ahead of the game, and Apple will have to invest a lot more resources if they expect to catch up. Apple may have the device advantage, but Amazon is leaps and bounds ahead when it comes to how you develop a community in support of voice-driven applications.</p>
<p>I wouldn't be surprised if Apple's release was in response to the waves Amazon is making with their voice platform. When it comes to the platform battles between tech giants, they can throw the necessary resources at things to play catch up, but it is something that other smaller players will not be able to always navigate. I'm reviewing a number of device-focused API efforts lately, and the ones who launched with an API are always ahead in the game.</p>
<p>Learning to do APIs well takes time, and learning to grow your API community of developers and partners will always take time to do properly--you just can't throw resources at it to make things scale properly. You might as well kick things off with an API and platform approach, even if it is in beta, and limited--at least you are getting going in a limited environment. Siri has been out there for a while now, but not as a platform, and I'm going to wager this will be a significant handicap.</p>
<p>What is your approach to technology? Is it more like Siri, or is it more like Alexa?</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Aug 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-safety.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was reading <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/08/darpa-cgc-safety-protocol">a post from the Electronic Frontier Foundation asking some great questions about having a safety protocol for things like the DARPA's Cyber Grand Challenge</a>. It is good to see EFF leading this conversation, providing us with some important things to consider as part of any security related work, whether it's in the cyber theater&nbsp;or just guiding your ethics as a small business, analyst or freelance hacker (I happen to be all three).&nbsp;</p>
<p>To hopefully contribute somewhat to the conversation, I wanted to think through some of the questions I ask when defining and helping folks secure their slice of the API landscape. There are two distinct portions of the conversation I wanted to chime in on, speaking to the areas that I find the most friction with when mapping out, and securing infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>The Dangers Of Being An API Cartographer In The Shadows Behind Mobile And Internet of Things</strong><br />Only a small fraction of web APIs available today are intentionally open to the public. The majority of web APIs out there are developed to support web, mobile, or device-based apps, delivering resources on the open Internet, but not meant to be viewed, accessed, and documented by 3rd parties.</p>
<p>API developers and architects heavily focused on the end deliverable, the web, mobile, system, or device integration, they do not consider the API to be open to the public--thus perceived as a private API, even though it uses public infrastructure. Many people frown on even mapping out this shadow API world, let along making and API definition or documentation publicly available.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I can publicly get access to a website, application, or device, I can map out the APIs, simply by routing traffic on my computer through a proxy. Before we can ensure this portion of our public infrastructure is secure, we must map it out, and we must change popular opinion to view this infrastructure as public, and begin securing it like it is, sharing maps of the infrastructure, and having an "open" conversation about it--not creating friction for those who do.</p>
<p><strong>A Fine Line Between Scanning For API Vulnerabilities And Executing a DDoS Attack On A Domain</strong><br />Once I have a map of the landscape, &nbsp;I can begin looking for vulnerabilities. Establishing the map (<a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">API definition</a>) is a grey zone for me, but actually scanning that map looking for even the most common of vulnerabilities is black, and a no-go zone for me. Before I can scan any domain used as part of API infrastructure, I will need the approval of the domain owner. Even a low-level security scan for the most common vulnerabilities will come across as a potential DDoS attack--requiring deeper considerations before doing it.</p>
<p>Much like the EFF sis looking to encourage a conversation around a safety protocol for cyber challenge related activity, I'd like to encourage a conversation about mapping and scanning of publicly available API infrastructure. I'd like to discuss the importance of having public maps be available, much like we do with physical infrastructure, both public and private. Then I'd like to also talk about how we can collectively ensure this infrastructure is secured properly, and have a sensible conversation about this, on a regular basis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not suggesting anything wild here. I do not get in trouble for driving by our local hospital, my child's school, or the local water plant. I shouldn't get in trouble for reporting a hole in the fence, or suspicious activity that I see when I drive or walk by either. I should also be able to be reassured that the hospital, school, and local water utility have a solid security plan, and have my best interest in mind when it comes to my healthcare data, student information, and water usage and billing information. Why is the virtual space so different?</p>
<p>I am just putting this out there, as I do. I walk this ethical line on a daily basis as I monitor the API space, and wanted to make my stance known. &nbsp;I am going to keep mapping out the known API universe, I feel comfortable pushing the boundaries of this grey zone. I will also be scanning, and helping secure API infrastructure using my <a href="https://sapience.io/">API security service Sapience</a>, but of course only when a customer asks me to. ;-)&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to Wikipedia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm">in mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a self-contained step-by-step set of operations to be performed. Algorithms perform a calculation, data processing, and/or automated reasoning tasks</a>. These often very abstract inventions are increasingly guiding our personal and professional worlds from <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/cover_story/2016/01/how_facebook_s_news_feed_algorithm_works.html">deciding what we read on Facebook</a>, <a href="http://thenextweb.com/apps/2016/05/12/twitter-periscope-real-time-video-scannning/">scanning the videos uploaded to your Twitter and Vine feed</a>, to whether or not <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing">you might commit a crime again</a>, and even <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-now-have-algorithms-to-predict-police-misconduct/">predict potential police misconduct</a>.</p>
<p>I see the concept of an algorithm applied in many different ways, some are very simple and easy to understand, and some are not so easy to understand, and operate as black boxes. One of the reasons I like APIs so much is <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/04/pushing-for-more-algorithmic-transparency-using-apis/">the possibility of introducing some transparency into how algorithms work</a> (or don't). APIs do not give visibility into the inner workings of algorithms by default, but when they are done right they can significantly contribute to a&nbsp;wider understanding of how they work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As with <a href="http://apievangelist.com">other areas of the API space that I research</a>, I'm intrigued with algorithms, how they are being used, and the role APIs can play in the wider conversation. <a href="http://algorithms.apievangelist.com/">I added an APIs and algorithms research project</a>, to help be understand how algorithms are being wielded, the news, companies, and code and schemas which are framing the conversation. The information I aggregate here will fuel my overall perspective of <a href="http://algorithms.apievangelist.com/">the intersection of API and algorithms</a>, and maybe yours too.</p>

<p>When I talk about how much I believe in APIs, all I am really saying is how much I believe in the web. The web is how humans are consuming and sharing data, content, and algorithms with each other using the Internet, and APIs are how systems, applications, and devices are doing this via the Internet.</p>
<p>I do not advocate for any single API, company, tooling, or technology. I am evangelizing for an open web. This is why I am always a little ashamed at how incomplete my understanding is of the core concepts that make up the web&nbsp;and the specifications that are driving it. Thankfully there are people like&nbsp;Erik Wilde (<a href="https://twitter.com/dret">@dret</a>) who work tirelessly to help us understand them, and make available in a simple way&nbsp;like he did <a href="http://webconcepts.info/">with his Web Concepts project</a>.</p>
<p>Erik has <a href="http://webconcepts.info/concepts/">organized&nbsp;13 Web Concepts for use to learn about</a>, detailing&nbsp;<span>445 distinct specifications across the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://webconcepts.info/specs/ISO">International Organization for Standardization (ISO)</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://webconcepts.info/specs/IETF">Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://webconcepts.info/specs/JCP">Java Community Process (JCP)</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="http://webconcepts.info/specs/W3C">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</a>. There are a number of these specifications I'm already aware of, but there are numerous others I am not, and that just isn't right.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help me increase my awareness and hopefully yours as well, I'm going to regularly tweet out individual concepts, and their specifications, linking to Erik's work. I encourage you to bookmark his work and get to work improving your web literacy where possible, and consider <a href="https://github.com/dret/webconcepts">forking his work and sharing within your organization</a> as well. It is important that we are all aware of these core building blocks of the web, and are reusing existing concepts and specifications across our work, wherever possible.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/05/airmap-is-positioning-itself-to-be-a-critical-api-broker-for-the-drone-industry/">I wrote a story last week about how Airmap is positioning itself to be an API broker within the fast growing Drone industry</a>. I also stumbled across <a href="https://www.astrodigital.com/api/">the satellite imagery API out of Astro Digital</a>, and specifically their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.astrodigital.com/api/">3rd Party Real-Time Data API</a>&nbsp;which is designed "to combine mass amounts of data, like adding live weather data on top of imagery"--resembling the layer of the drone industry which Airmap is investing in.</p>
<p>Airmap&nbsp;is delivering geo-intelligence for applications used when flying drones, Astro Digital has an API which injects geo-intelligence at the satellite image layer--I guess the satellite layer would be one layer up from the drone layer when it comes to APIs providing access to our physical world. Which leaves me considering all the other potential layers of our physical world being opened up using APIs.</p>
<p>Security cameras, sensors, and other Internet-connected devices are rapidly opening up our physical world using APIs. The API solutions being opened up by Airmap and Astro Digital are allowing us to access, inject, remix, and make decisions in real time. I find this intriguing because there are so many dimensions present beyond just a single resource being made available via an API, and allows for true multi-API integration, while also employing APIs to direct physical activity like drone flights.</p>
<p>Beyond the myriad of API implementations that are available within this new landscape, I feel it is also is something that demonstrates the <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/2015/03/31/weather-means-business/">opportunity surrounding weather data</a>, government open data (<a href="http://tfr.faa.gov/tfr2/list.html">FAA situation data</a>), and other relevant data, content, media, and algorithms being opened up today. I find it endlessly fascinating to try and&nbsp;keep up with the different ways that API-driven resources are being used to open up and generate revenue, taking advantage of opportunities that are emerging as this new API landscape expands both digitally and physically.</p>

This was when web APIs went from the hobby level (ie. photos, social, links) workbench, and became a tool I could actually use in my business toolbox. Web APIs weren't just used or fun and games anymore, opening up my eyes to the endless possibilities when you make the web programmable using APIs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2016, I see a number of APIs show up on my monitoring radar, and honestly, most of them are not that notable--then you come across the solutions like the dead simple <a href="https://www.astrodigital.com/api/">satellite imagery API from Astro Digital</a>. I'm increasingly finding myself tracking on the collision APIs are having with our physical world, so I see a lot of interesting (and some not so) APIs, but I find the notion that you can get the latest picture of a specific place on earth is a pretty significant milestone for web APIs.</p>
<p>For me the Astro Digital satellite imagery API demonstrates for me the power of the&nbsp;Uniform Resource Locator (URL) and the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)--I can get a snapshot of any location on earth, and manipulate my view of it using a single URI, from within any web or mobile application. This is just one of many APIs available to the average developer today, providing access to a wealth of high-value resources, that used to only be accessible to larger companies who could afford it.</p>
<p>I just wanted to pause for a moment, and take notice of some of the important resources that are being made available via APIs today, because I feel like the landscape is shifting pretty quickly with the introduction of these valuable resources. When companies small companies can work with the same resources as large enterprises and institutions, interesting things are possible.</p>

        <span class="post-date">05 Aug 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-broken.png" alt="" width="32%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I have done a lot of reading in the last week, catching up on my monitoring of the API space. I have read a couple of posts about the reliability of APIs, and the overall viability of building applications, and businesses based upon them. A couple of the posts were focusing on <a href="https://medium.com/@anildash/the-end-of-thinkup-e600bc46cc56#.9dhazj3vf">the shuttering of ThinkUp</a>, but a couple others were just part of the regular flow of these stories that question whether we can depend on APIs or not--nothing new, as this is a regular staple of bloggers and the wider tech blogosphere.</p>
<p>My official stance on this line of thinking is that I would not want to be building a business, and application that depends on leading API platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and others, but I will happily build a business, applications, and system integration on APIs. You see, this isn't an API issue, it is a business and vendor viability issue. As with other sectors, there are badly behaved business, and there are well-behaved businesses--I try to choose to do business with the well-behaved one's (can't always achieve this, but I try).</p>
<p>I find the ongoing desire of the startup culture to point out how unreliable APIs are, while simultaneously&nbsp;supporting the overall business tone set by venture capital investment, often delusionally blind levels of support, is just not reconcilable. I'm not saying all VC investment is bad, so don't even take this down that road. I am saying that the quest for VC investment, and the shift in priorities once VC investment is acquired, then further shift with each additional round, and the final exit is setting a tone that is completely at odds with API reliability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem really begins when APIs become the front-end for this blame. If I depend on vendors for my brick and mortar store, and the delivery trucks don't reliably bring my products, I don't talk about how you can't depend on trucks--I find new vendors. Of course, I can't find new vendors if they can't be replaced like Twitter and Facebook, but this is a whole other conversation, although it is also one that is a symptom of the tone being set by the VC currents (this is a business conversation). Blaming APIs instead of raising questions about the business ethics bar being set by venture capital shows the blinding power of greed, as the tech community refuses to blame VC $$, and shifts this to being about the viability of APIs, because I will get my VC $$ some day too bro!</p>
<p>I am not saying APIs are always good. I'm just saying they aren't bad. Hell, they aren't neutral. They are a simply a reflection of the business behind them, as well as being a reflection of the industry they operate in. Stop blaming them for businesses not giving a shit about developers, and the end-users. Maybe we could start changing the tone by admitting the #1 priority is always set by VC $$, and not by our API community, or even our end-users and customers, and all this shit is out of whack.</p>

<p>I've seen quite a few&nbsp;incomplete&nbsp;API efforts in my time as the API Evangelist. It is why I aggregate the most common building blocks I see across successful API providers like Twilio and organize them into blueprints anyone can follow like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/04/10/my-minimum-viable-api-footprint-definition/">my minimum viable API footprint definition</a>. It doesn't take much effort to pull together a basic API presence like this&nbsp;and is something that can go a long ways to help onboard new API consumers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a number of interesting APIs out there like <a href="https://dl.ubnt.com/aircontrol/aircontrol-api-alpha.pdf">the AirControl API</a>, which gives you <a href="https://www.ubnt.com/products/">programmatic access to enterprise-grade wifi and wireless network solutions from Ubiquiti Networks</a>, but then quickly reduces a pretty robust API effort to being just a PDF document. I still keep an eye on these APIs like this because they offer value, and give a look at how ubiquitous web APIs are becoming. It also demonstrates how much more work I have ahead of me when it comes to educating the coming wave of device API providers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another thing this demonstrates for me&nbsp;is that this wave of Internet-connected device APIs will also suffer from many of the same illnesses that API providers have had when deploying APIs for mobile applications. These APIs are often hastily designed and deployed, where documentation, authentication, and security are often an&nbsp;afterthought or not even a thought at all.</p>
<p>I am working on reworking some of my forkable Github templates for deploying API portals. I am going to c<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/04/10/my-minimum-viable-api-footprint-definition/">reate a minium viable API portal solution</a> that can be easily&nbsp;forked, helping API providers quickly launch a more coherent presence&nbsp;without much effort. I'm going to also create a complete API portal solution that takes into consideration <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/04/07/i-have-an-api-now-i-need-some-help-to-identify-what-is-needed-to-manage-my-api-presence/">the complete list of building blocks for an API presence</a> that I've gathered from across the API landscape.</p>

<p>As the number of available <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">API definitions</a> out there grows, I am increasingly coming across variations of APIs that I already have included in my <a href="http://theapistack.com/">API Stack</a>. It can be tedious to try and sync these with existing copies, so I wanted to take a look and see if there was anything already available out there, that would help provide a diff for either OpenAPI Spec, RAML, or API Blueprint.</p>
<p>The most common one I found referenced was <a href="https://github.com/civisanalytics/swagger-diff">a Ruby one for OpenAPI Spe</a>c from&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/civisanalytics">Civis Analytics</a>. Next, I found a pretty <a href="https://zallek.github.io/swagger-diff/">interesting web tool</a>, which provides its <a href="https://github.com/zallek/swagger-diff/">Node.js source code on Github</a>, including a CLI edition. After these two solutions, I only found <a href="https://github.com/myexpr/raml-diff">one more for RAML</a>, but couldn't find anything for API Blueprint.</p>
<p>I wanted to think beyond just the common API definition formats&nbsp;and look for diff tools that would work just for JSON. I found <a href="https://github.com/andreyvit/json-diff">Diff</a> which was pretty interesting, as well as <a href="https://github.com/janmonschke/diffsync">DiffSync</a> which provided a real-time&nbsp;diff for JSON. I haven't tried any of them out, I am just trying to compile a list of what is out there&nbsp;before I dive into what their capabilities are.</p>
<p>I have a master database of API definitions where I can just import API definitions that I find, and it will add any new paths, parameters, and schemas it comes across. I would much rather have the ability to just run each version through a diff tool, and be able to select which elements I want to have merged. For now, I will just implement a custom layer to my API monitoring system, but I would like to see API diff move forward similar to we saw the conversation evolve with the introduction of&nbsp;<a href="https://apitransformer.com/">API Transformer</a>.</p>

<p>I first came across Airmap as <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/02/direct-government-connection-into-internet-of-things-devices-like-we-are-seeing-with-drones/">I was learning about them acting as the middle man for DJI drone updates via the Department of Interior</a>. After this story, I added them to my database of companies that I track on. Then as I was monitoring my feeds I saw <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSFWN1AK0VL?type=companyNews">they were now working with IBM to get weather information</a> for use by drone manufacturers, operators, and those impacted by drone activity.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.airmap.com/">Airmap</a>&nbsp;positions themselves as "airspace Intelligence", offering low-altitude airspace management solution for unmanned aircraft. When you consider the drone as just one of many devices being connected to the Internet, the role intelligence providers like Airmap will play when it comes to system to system integrations, and web or mobile application development in each space--the company seems to be well-positioned for success in the drone industry.</p>
<p>Airmap is working hard to define the physical space, the constants, as well as some of the most ephemeral layers of our physical world like weather, forest fires, and events that are increasingly impacting our online reality via the web and our mobile phones. Airmap is aggregating valuable data, like the <a href="http://tfr.faa.gov/tfr2/list.html">updates they get from the Department of Interior (open data)</a> to the partner data like they will be ingesting like the weather data from IBM.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Airmap provides access to their&nbsp;<a href="https://sdk.airmap.io/">flight conditions and other airspace data from Airspace via API(s)</a>, and has established&nbsp;some pretty significant manufacturer relationships, as well as open and partner data sources--providing the beginnings of a pretty interesting Internet of things business blueprint for what I'd consider to be a sort of API broker. When you consider the influence some of these API brokers have in the&nbsp;governance of airspace around nuclear power plants or even the Olympics, and govern an assortment of&nbsp;Internet-connected devices--the API opportunity appears to be pretty interesting.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Aug 2016</span>
        <p><a href="https://developer.bbb.org"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/bbb.jpg" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I was happy to stumble across the <a href="https://developer.bbb.org">Better Business Bureau API</a> the other day. I was working on a piece about "the API economy", and looking for real world examples of how APIs could actually contribute positively (or negatively) to the actual economy, and found the useful API.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Better Business Bureau&nbsp;provides five API endpoints for consumers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://developers.bbb.org/documentation/endpoints/organization-search/">Organization Search</a></strong> - This endpoint will allow you to search for Organizations that are known to the BBB. &nbsp;Organizations may include businesses or charities.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developers.bbb.org/documentation/endpoints/organization-collections/">Organization Collections</a> -</strong> BBB Partners will need to be able to identify collections of Organizations that they care about and be able to manage those collections and receive Organization info and updates on them as needed.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developers.bbb.org/documentation/endpoints/bulk-retrieval/">Bulk Retrieval</a> -</strong> This section defines the message specification that will be sent back to the API partners who request a bulk data transfer. &nbsp;</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developers.bbb.org/documentation/endpoints/push-notifications/">Push Notifications</a> - </strong>BBB Partners have the need to be notified when BBB data updates occur for the records or a collection of records they are currently subscribed to.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developers.bbb.org/documentation/endpoints/bbb-investigation-application-for-accreditation/">BBB Investigation/Application for Accreditation</a></strong> - This endpoint allows submission of organizations for BBB investigation and application for BBB accreditation.</li>
</ul>
<p>They provide&nbsp;a pretty valuable service, which is significantly amplified when there is an API present. Being able to find out which companies are accredited or have complaints against them in real time has endless potential for impacting real world decisions that may influence the economy one way or the other. Being able to automate this process for a digital age, convinced me that this should be in the list of APIs that reflect my thoughts on the wider API economy.</p>
<p>I will be including the&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.bbb.org">Better Business Bureau API</a>&nbsp;in my overall API ranking research, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/10/31/how-are-we-going-to-create-the-standard-and-poors-and-moodys-for-the-api-economy/">which is something I've explored in the past</a>, but will be spending some more time thinking in the&nbsp;context of the API economy. I will also profile the BBB API, to contribute to the design patterns I will be considering when it comes to designing business and API ranking, investigation, and accreditation&nbsp;resources.</p>

<p>I was reading some of the blog posts, Reddit&nbsp;and Hacker News threads about <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/api-guidelines">Microsoft's release of their API design guid</a>e. While many of the comments are technically correct, the tone in which they are delivered, and the intent behind their delivery is one of the biggest contributing factors to why we have such wild inconsistencies in API design across the landscape.&nbsp;</p>
<p>API Evangelist was born in 2010 out of frustration with the Restafarian pundit class. I made it my mission to help tell stories of the technical, business, and politics of APIs in an inclusive way, that didn't make people feel stupid for what they didn't understand. Even after six years of doing this, I am still learning things about APIs and being regularly reminded that there are few absolutes when it comes API design, definition, deployment, management, or any of <a href="http://apievangelist.com">the other 50+ stops along the API life cycle that I track on</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I stopped sharing my blog posts to Hacker News, Reddit, and DZone (reversed after they invested in change) because of hostile responses to my thoughts. I cannot imagine what it is like to work hard on your API design strategy at a company, then share publicly, only to get flamed because it wasn't REST compliant. Many folks will never even attempt this for fear of being flamed, and those that do, will often never make the mistake twice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the opposite of what we want. We want EVERYONE organizing, publishing, and sharing their API design patterns so that we can all learn from each other. We don't want to make people feel stupid for what they do not know. We want to encourage everyone to learn, grow, evolve, and build on each other's design patterns and work from across the API sector.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's work to encourage more companies to craft, publish, and share their API design patterns. Let's please stop REST shaming folks, it didn't work in 2010, and it doesn't work in 2016. Making people feel dumb will never get us to a place where API developers and architects are truly HTTP&nbsp;literate, and well informed of existing patterns, let alone actually putting them to work across their organizations.&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Aug 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-algorithmic-transparency-2.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I saw the potential for collaboration when it came to using web APIs back around 2004 and 2005. I was seeing innovative companies opening up their digital assets to the world using low-cost, efficient Internet technology like HTTP, opening things up for potentially interesting approaches to collaboration around the development of web and mobile applications on top of valuable digital resources. This approach has brought us valuable platforms like Amazon Web Services and SalesForce.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Common API discussions tend to focus on providing APIs to an ecosystem of developers&nbsp;and encouraging the development of&nbsp;web and mobile applications, widgets, visualizations, and other integrations that benefit the platform. In the course of these operations, it is also customary to gather feedback from the community&nbsp;and work to evolve the APIs design, available resources, and even the underlying data model--extending collaboration to also be about the APIs, and underlying resources, in addition to just building things on top of the API.</p>
<p>This approach to designing, defining, and deploying APIs, and then also web and mobile applications on top of these APIs is nothing new, and is something that I have been tracking on for over the last six years. The transparency that can be injected into the evolution of data, content, and potentially the "algorithms behind" with APIs is significant, which is how it became such a big part of my professional mission, and fueling my drive to spread the "gospel" whenever and wherever I can.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ok, so how can APIs contribute to algorithmic transparency? To fully grasp where I am taking this, you need to understand that APIs can be used as an input and output for data, content, as well as algorithms. Let's use Twitter as an example. Using Twitter and the Twitter API I can read and write data about myself, or any user, using the /account and /users API endpoints--providing the content and data portion of what I am talking about.</p>
<p>When it comes to the algorithm portion, Twitter API has several methods, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/statuses/user_timeline">GET statuses/user_timeline</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/statuses/home_timeline">GET statuses/home_timeline</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/search/tweets">GET search/tweets</a>, which return a "timeline of Tweet data". In 2006 this timeline was just the latest Tweets from the users you follow, in sequential order. In 2016, you will get "content powered by a variety of signals". In short, <a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/164083">the algorithm that drives the Twitter timeline is pretty complicated</a>, with a number of things to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your home timeline displays a stream of Tweets from accounts you have chosen to follow on Twitter.&nbsp;</li>
<li>You may see suggested content powered by a variety of signals.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Tweets you are likely to care about most will show up first in your timeline.&nbsp;</li>
<li>You may see a summary of the most interesting Tweets you received since your last visit</li>
<li>You may also see content such as promoted Tweets or Retweets in your timeline.</li>
<li>Additionally, when we identify a Tweet, an account to follow, or other content that's popular or relevant, we may add it to your timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a number of considerations that would go into any one timeline response--this is Twitter's algorithm. While I technically have access to this algorithm via three separate API endpoints, there really isn't much algorithmic transparency present, <a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/164083">beyond their overview in the support section</a>. Most companies are going to claim this is their secret sauce and their intellectual property. That is fine, I don't have a problem with y'all being secretive about this, even though I will always push you to be more open, as well as leave the API layer out of your patents you use to pretect your algorithms.</p>
<p>Algorithmic transparency with APIs is not something that should be applied to all APIs in my opinion, but for regulated industries, and truly open API solutions, transparency can go a long way, and bring a number of benefits. All Twitter (and any other API provider) has to do is add parameters, and corresponding that open up the variables of the underlying algorithm for each endpoint. What goes into considerations about "what I care about", constitutes "interesting", and what makes things "popular or relevant"? Twitter will never do this, but other API providers can.</p>
<p>It is up to each API provider to decide how transparent they are going to be with their algorithms. The ideal solution when it comes to transparency is that the algorithm is documented and shared along with supporting&nbsp;code on Github, like <a href="https://github.com/Chicago/food-inspections-evaluation">Chicago, did for their food inspection algorithm</a>. This opens up the algorithm, and the code behind for evaluation by 3rd parties, potentially improving upon it, as well as validating the logic behind--potentially opening up a conversation about the life of the algorithm.</p>
<p>There are a number of common reasons I have seen for companies and developers not opening up their algorithms:</p>
<ul>
<li>It truly is secret sauce, and too much was invested to just share with the world.</li>
<li>It is crap, and the creator doesn't want anyone to know there is nothing behind.</li>
<li>There are malicious things going on behind the scenes that they do not want to be public.</li>
<li>Insecurities about coding abilities, security practices and logic applied to the algorithms.</li>
<li>Exist in competitive space with lots of bad actors, and may want to limit this behavior.</li>
<li>What is accomplished isn't really that defensible, and the only advantage is to keep hidden.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have no problem making an argument for algorithmic transparency when it comes to regulated industries, like financial, healthcare, and education. I think it should be default in all civic, non-profit, and other similar scenarios where the whole stack should just be open sourced, and available on Github. You won't find me pushing back to hard on the startups unless I see some wild claims about the magic behind, or I see evidence of exploitation, then you will hear me rant about this some more.</p>
<p>Algorithmic transparency can help limit algorithmic exploitation&nbsp;and the other shady shit that is going on behind the scenes on a regular basis these days. <a href="http://apievangelist.com">I have added an algorithm section to my research</a>, and as I see more talk about the magic of algorithms, and how these amazing creations are changing our world--I am going to be poking around a bit, and probably asking to see more algorithmic transparency when I think it makes sense.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Aug 2016</span>
        <p><a href="http://terms-of-service.apievangelist.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-terms-of-use.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I find myself thinking about what the terms of service we agree to for online services are doing to our lives. Whether we see the effects or not, they are guiding almost everything we do in our personal and professional worlds. They are something that began on our desktop computers, migrated to our more mobile laptops, then deeper into our personal lives via our mobile smartphones.</p>
<p>We rarely understand what we are agreeing to when we check the box for these terms of service, which leaves me really surprised to see us accept the application of terms of service to everyday objects we depend on, as part of the Internet of Things movement. As physical objects in our lives get connected to the Internet, they begin to generate valuable data, requiring software to manage--all being directed by the terms of service set forth by the manufacturer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can see this playing out as manufacturers like <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/203913-general-motors-john-deere-want-to-keep-tinkering-self-repair-illegal">GM and John Deer are limiting what you can do with their physically connected equipment</a>. These terms of service are changing the meaning of ownership, and evolving te physical things we purchase into subscriptions, instead of outright ownership. Following the tone of the conversation set by terms of service which is guiding software, this new breed of terms of service being applied to physical objects in a way that heavily benefits manufacturers, shifting as much the risk as possible to the consumers, leaving many of the benefits as possible for themselves.</p>
<p>In the rapidly expanding online and mobile worlds we (consumers) have almost no tools that help us manage the terms of service we are agreeing to, and almost no leverage when it comes to how these are crafted, changed, and applied. Why the hell would we keep this rapid pace continuing into the physical world, as well as our online worlds? It just doesn't pencil out? Especially when you consider how we give up so much of our privacy, security, and ownership as in agreeing to these terms of service.</p>
<p>How terms of service are applied to virtual and increasingly physical objects that are being connected to the Internet are much like algorithms, as they are often coded black boxes that we do not always understand. I will keep tracking on them the best I can, but as a community, we need a lot more resources if we are going to shift the balance of all of this more in the favor of the average consumer.</p>

<p>I am working on each portion of this and considering how I can add. I do not see any reason why this can't be applied to other areas of our information, like social, electricity, and beyond. I get that health care information has been granted a special place in our digital worlds, but I think we need to asking ourselves where else this might also apply.</p>
<p>It is tough to digest this in its full legal form. This is why I work to break them down as plain English building blocks that I can include alongside my research. If we can make turn this into an easy to read checklist that any data steward could use as best practices when crafting their own approach tot he disclosure of our information, maybe more companies will step up to the plate.</p>

        <span class="post-date">03 Aug 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/bw-science-api.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I had heard about the <a href="http://labs.pathology.wisc.edu/oconnor/index.html">Zika virus research</a> that was going on at the&nbsp;University of Wisconsin listening to <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/03/08/469653715/scientists-report-in-real-time-on-challenging-zika-research">an NPR episode this last spring</a>. I finally had the time to dig into the topic a little more, and learn more about where the research is at, and some of the software behind the sharing and collaboration around the research.</p>
<p>The urgency in getting the raw data and results of the research out to the wider scientific community caught my attention and the potential for applying API related approaches seems pretty huge. When it comes to mission-critical&nbsp;research that could impact thousands or millions of people, it seems like there should be a whole suite of open tooling that people can employ to ensure sharing and collaboration are real time and frictionless.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I dug into the <a href="https://zika.labkey.com/project/home/begin.view">Zika virus research</a>, I was happy to find the <a href="http://www.labkey.com/">LabKey technology</a> employed to publish the research. I do not know much about them yet, but I was happy to see the <a href="http://www.labkey.com/products-services/labkey-server/download-community-edition/">open source community solution</a>, <a href="https://www.labkey.org/home/Documentation/wiki-page.view?name=dev">developer resources</a> including a <a href="https://www.labkey.org/home/Documentation/wiki-page.view?name=dev">web API for integrating with research that is published using the platform</a>. There are plenty of improvements I'd like to see added to the API and developer efforts, but it is a damn good start when it comes to making important scientific research much more shareable and collaborative.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll spend more time learning more about what LabKey currently offers, and then I'll work to establish some sort of next steps blueprint that would employ other modern API approaches to help ensure important research can be&nbsp;made more real-time, aggregated, interoperable, and shareable using technology like <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">definitions</a>, <a href="http://webhooks.apievangelist.com">Webhooks</a>, <a href="http://ipaas.apievangelist.com">iPaaS</a>, and other common areas of a modern API effort.</p>
<p>When it comes to research, scientists should&nbsp;have a wealth of open tooling and resources that make their work a collaborative and shareable process by default, but with as much control as they desire--something modern web API solutions excel at. I added LabKey to a new research area dedicated to science. I will spend more time going through space, and see what guides, blueprints, and other resources I can pull together to assist researchers in their API journey.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-country-in-database.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I've been <a href="https://integriography.wordpress.com/2016/07/11/doidoe-did-not-ban-dji-products-but/">reading a number of stories about concerns within the Department of Interior about the usage of DJI drones as part of their UAV operations</a>. Whether or not the federal agency actually issued a ban on using the drones is another story, regardless I wanted to extract this concept and apply to the wider world of Internet of Things, in which drones are definitely a poster child for.</p>
<p>In our race to connect devices to the Internet, at the consumer and industrial level, what considerations are being made regarding what data is collected, how this information is transmitted (via which networks), and ultimately where is data being stored (which country). Obviously, this is something the federal government is beginning to think about, but I'm guessing hasn't fully formed an approach to dealing with this problem consistently across agencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>People love to dismiss individual consumer right to know about their data at this level, as nobody cares enough, but at the corporate, institutional, and agency level we better be taking things a little more seriously. If you are uploading your organizational intelligence unknowingly to servers out of the country, or in jurisdictions where it might be easily shared with your competitors or rival factions--you might want to be thinking about switching providers. ;-)</p>
<p>As platform providers how will we be certifying the chain of custody for the Internet-connected devices we are manufacturing, and within the applications and system they employ? As device consumers, how will we ensure that ALL the devices we are employing are in sync with our organizational mission and governance?&nbsp;</p>
<p>So many interesting questions being asked right now, as we race to wire up our physical world to the Internet...</p>

<p>I wish every time you came across facts and statistics in any news story, blog post, report, and beyond, there would be an interactive experience like you get with <a href="http://www.census.gov/quickfacts/dashboard/SEX255215/45,32">the US Census Bureau's QuickFacts tool</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>QuickFacts provides statistics for all states and counties, and for cities and towns with a population of 5,000 or more, and provides everything I think you need to make the case behind any facts and statistics you are presenting.</p>
<p>Using the tool you get a table, chart, map, data download, email results, and share via popular social networks as well as embeddable tooling. The QuickFacts experience should be a default for all storytelling around open data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Census team has clearly worked very hard to make a wealth of very complicated data much more accessible, usable, and easily understood through proven approaches to telling stories using open data.</p>
<p>If you are in the business of publishing open data and APIs&nbsp;and building analytics and visualization tools, follow the lead of the US Census Bureau, and develop easy to use API tooling like the QuickFacts solution.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Aug 2016</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-algorithmic-transparency.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></p>
<p>API Evangelist is focused on helping push for sensible API-driven transparency wherever I can get it. When done in sensible ways an API can crack open the often black box&nbsp;that is the algorithm,&nbsp;giving us access and more control over our online experience.</p>
<p>One of the most significant algorithmic bottlenecks that govern our daily lives is our mobile data plans. All of our mobile phones are governed at the data plan level--this is where the telecom companies make their money, throttling the bits and bytes we depend on each day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The mobile data plan is a great place to discuss the algorithmic and data transparency that APIs can assist with, and one example of this in action is with the <a href="http://youtube-eng.blogspot.com/2016/04/announcing-mobile-data-plan-api.html">Google Mobile Data Plan API</a>. Google wants more access at this level to improve the quality of experience for end-users when using mobile applications like Youtube, which can be severely impacted by data plan limits, while also significantly impacting your data plan consumption if not optimized.</p>
<p>There is so much opportunity for discussion between mobile network operator, API providers, developers, consumers at the data plan level. I know mobile network operators would rather keep this a black box, so they can maximize their revenue, but when you crack the network layer open with a publicly available API, there will be a number of new revenue opportunities.</p>
<p>Data plans affect all of us, every single day. We need more transparency into the algorithms that meter, limit, and charge us at the mobile data plan layer. We need the platforms we depend on each day to have more tools to optimize how applications consume (or do not consume) this extremely (seemingly) finite, and valuable resource (thanks, telcos!).&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've added an algorithms area to my research to keep an eye on this topic, curate stories I find, and share my own thoughts when it comes to algorithmic transparency using APIs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Aug 2016</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.airmap.com/wildfire-awareness-geofencing-drones/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/Wildfire-Screenshot-Web-App-1.png" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I have been spending a lot of time this summer thinking about how devices are being connected to the Internet, specifically when it comes to drones. As I was traveling around the countryside flying drones, I increasingly came across stories about drones being a nuisance, and most notably being a big huge problem for firefighting crews.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am flying a DJI Phantom 3 Professional drone, so <a href="http://www.dji.com/newsroom/news/dji-and-airmap-deliver-real-time-wildfire-awareness-and-geofencing-capabilities-for-drones">I was interested to see DJI recently enable real-time geofencing capabilities for drone pilots</a>. If you are unfamiliar with how these drones work, your drone controller is simply an iPad enabled joystick&nbsp;and a mobile application which becomes your control center. Before you can fly the drone the application goes through a whole series of checks making sure all of the drones variety of systems are all in check.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These drones are hyper aware of their location, maintaining a very detailed flight and activity log. The new DJI geofencing capabilities will now give you updates on wildfire, military, prison, nuclear power plants and other flight hazards via the DJI GO mobile application. DJI get's its information from <a href="https://www.airmap.com/wildfire-awareness-geofencing-drones/">airspace intelligence company Airmap</a>, who gets their information from <span>Federal Aviation Administration&nbsp;</span><a href="http://tfr.faa.gov/tfr2/list.html">Temporary Flight Restrictions</a><span>&nbsp;(TFR)</span>&nbsp;feed--all driving drone pilot(s) decision on whether it's safe to fly or not.</p>
<p><em>"GEO by default limits flights into or take-off within locations that raise safety or security concerns. If a flight within one of these locations has been authorized, GEO allows users with verified DJI accounts to temporarily unlock or self-authorize their flights. This </em>unlock<em> function is not available for sensitive national-security locations"</em>, according to the DJI Geo system overview. It is interesting to see how this update can be used as an advisory, or something that prevents the operation of a very geo-aware, and&nbsp;Internet-connected device.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the part of drone activity I find intriguing. I thoroughly enjoy flying them, but the precedent being set for potentially the future of Internet-connected devices is what I find infinitely more interesting. There are a couple of things at play here that I think are important. The fact that an Internet-connected device has the advisory&nbsp;and kill-switch like this is interesting, but also the fact that a manufacturer (Chinese one) has opted to do this on their own (maybe there is another story behind), and that a federal agency data feed can play a real time role in how devices and their operators are making decisions out in the field.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I envision this model being used even more when it comes to federal government regulation of Internet of Things devices, but also within the corporate and institutional governance lifecycle--with devices, and their operators being part of a centralized, API driven, command and control infrastructure. I have a number of stories to work through on this subject, and will keep sharing anything I come across when it comes to direct government connections to the Internet of Things like I am seeing in the drone sector.</p>

        <span class="post-date">01 Aug 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/IMG_3539.png" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I am starting the process of getting back to work on API Evangelist, and wrapping up our&nbsp;<a href="http://dronerecovery.org">Drone Recovery</a> project. We will continue working on things throughout the summer, but I need to start looking at what's next for myself, and thanks to the API community, what I'll be doing next with API Evangelist.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks to the generosity of the API community we were able to stay afloat while spending May through July hiking the hills of Oregon. We are now spending the final months of summer and fall, getting the kid on his feet in Portland, as well as figuring out what our own next steps are. Thankfully we still have an apartment to come back to, and I have API Evangelist domain to work under--I just need to figure out what is next for this production.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There were no amazing revelations for me out in the woods. The journey just reinforced how important my work around the technology, business, and politics of APIs is to me. I enjoy paying attention to space and feel that I can continue to contribute by providing analysis that is product and vendor neutral (most of the time).</p>
<p>When it comes to APIs there are several things that keep me interested, and wanting to work on API Evangelist:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some of the people and companies in the community</li>
<li>Some of the technology being applied in API space</li>
<li>Opportunities for collaboration and transparency</li>
<li>Writing, telling my story, as well as story of others</li>
</ul>
<p>Then there are some things that I could do without when doing this work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some of the people in the community ;-(</li>
<li>The heavy focus on VC investment, acquisitions, and exits</li>
<li>Lack of critical thinking when it comes to applying technology.</li>
</ul>
<p>I do not think I'll make any significant changes to the way API Evangelist operates. I was already limiting my engagement with the companies and people that I feel do not care about the wider community. I will just keep writing and telling stories about what I think matters most when it comes to APIs, and the people, companies, institutions, agencies, and industries they are touching in 2016.</p>
<p>Thanks again to the community, for giving me the breathing room to get back on my feet in a thoughtful way, and not make any drastic decisions&nbsp;about API Evangelist, and how I will keep the lights on. I will begin slowly ramping things up here in August, getting back to my monitoring of the space, and crafting stories on the blog.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I was already doing before things shifted this summer, I will continue to pull back some of my research behind a paywall of industry guides, and other long-form content that will help support my ongoing research. The short form analysis and commentary will remain open, helping provide the regular stream of API banter that people seem to have grown accustomed to. The tone will remain the same, as the short form stories are generated as part of the conversation I have with myself about what I'm seeing in the space, and not about any particular brand, company, or approach (unless it stands out).</p>
<p>There is not much else to say. Thank you again for helping make sure my website was still here when I got back. Thanks for being so understanding when it came to disappearing on our journey this summer. I look forward to the future of API Evangelists--whatever that might look like.</p>

<p>I came out of the wilderness this week (literally, the Kalmiopsis Wilderness) to an inbox full of emails and a Twitter stream full of messages and DMs. I expected a little buzz from my exit, but not to the extent that it did, let alone the direction it took.</p>

<p>I am incredibly humbled by the community's response, and honestly, I'm not well equipped to deal with this type of attention. I know there are some folks out there who think I am some sort of attention seeker, but that is the part of all of this that I really struggle with the most. I have to step aside from myself to be able to write. Otherwise, I'm left incapacitated.</p>

<p>I am incredibly thankful for the API community. I have had the bar set pretty high for this community throughout the last six years, and you managed to raise it beyond what I had already set in my mind. I kindasorta thought some of you were reading my rants, but it kind of terrifies me now how many of you actually were.</p>

<p>Sooooooo....while I received some very fine bids on API Evangelist this week, as well as some pretty creative solutions for keeping alive and generating revenue, <a href="https://www.generosity.com/community-fundraising/the-most-important-api-call-for-kin-lane">I'm going to accept the community's bid for the domain</a>. It will remain the community's API Evangelist voice, as it has 87.34% of the time (I am a sellout, just not very good one) over the last six years -- I will just leave it as is.</p>

<p>The blog and Twitter account will remain dormant, as I will have no time to do any work. If you do have a post which you feel would be "worthy" of publishing to the blog over the summer, feel free to fork, and submit as pull request. When I come out of woods, I'll consider accepting it for publishing. If not, you will have to wait until I get my head back into tech to read anything more.</p>

<p>All the rest of the bids I received for the site, I'll have to decline. Thank you for your kind offers and will try to get everyone a short email response. That's all I got. I have enough money to get through the summer now, pay for gas, food, and the occasional campsite and motel. Oh, and some cool <a href="http://dronerecovery.org">drone equipment</a>! I have no idea what the summer holds, so I can't make any predictions for the fall -- we will see.</p>

<p>I can say, that you should <a href="https://medium.com/@njyx/priority-overflow-991fcf1e2f3#.pyf959fke">take Steve's advice in his blog post</a>, and don't take anything for granted. Especially going to the bathroom in a toilet. Don't take that for granted. It's a wonderful thing!! ;-)&nbsp;</p>

<p>It has been six years since I started API Evangelist. A personal matter has come up which will require my attention for at least six months, probably upwards of a year. Which in the tech world can be centuries--when you are dealing in real time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With this in mind, I will be putting the apievangelist.com domain, and @apievangelist Twitter account up for auction. When I come back (if I do), I'm perfectly happy starting over, and I need all the funds I can get to get me through the summer, and API Evangelist is the only asset I own.</p>
<p>I am very sorry for the impact on my business partners, but family and human beings come first, and I'm sure they will be fine. If you want the short and sweet on what I'm doing head over to kinlane.com blog, and <a href="http://dronerecovery.org/journal/drone-recovery/">if you want to follow the story of what I'm up to this summer you can head over to dronerecovery.org</a>.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;apievangelist.com&nbsp;website does over 50K page views monthly with about 30K uniques. The Twitter account has 5K followers, and growing every day--perfect for any API company. I'm taking bids for all of it to fund what I'm doing the next few months. API Evangelist is worth a lot to me, so I'm starting the bidding at 10K, and accepting the highest bidder by May 27th.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Email your bids to kinlane@gmail.com. The entire site runs on Jekyll via Github, so I can just transfer domain, and transfer the organization to you via Github. If the site does not sell, I will just leave up, and contemplate its future at a later date.</p>
<p>Thank you for all your support--it was a fun ride.</p>

<p>API management is the oldest area of my research. The area has been being defined since Mashery first opened its doors in 2006&nbsp;and continues to be defined with the recent IPO by Apigee, and the entry of AWS into the sector with the AWS API Gateway. API management is often defined by the services offered by these companies, but also by the strategies of leading API providers in the space.</p>
<p>My API management research walks through the common building blocks of the space, the open source tooling, and API service providers who are serving the space. I first started this guide in 2010 and 2011 and have worked to evolve with each release, as well as the fast pace change that seems to occur in the space.</p>
<p>This guide touches on, and often overlaps with my other areas of research (as everything was born out of this), but should provide you with what you need as a checklist for evolving your existing API management strategy, or help you craft a brand new one for your new API. This guide has a heavy focus on a service provider led approach to API management, but with the growth in open source solutions lately, I'm working to evolve more towards a DIY approach to making it work.</p>
<p>I fund my research through consulting, selling my guides, and the generous support of my sponsors. I appreciate your support in helping me continue with my work and hope you find it relevant in your API journey.</p>

<p>One of the things that stood out for me <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/05/10/twitter-collection-of-sarahjeong-xor-swiftstories-oracle-vs-google-coverage/">reading through the Oracle v Google trial coverage today</a>&nbsp;was Sarah Jeong's acknowledging how APIs are kind of hard to understand, and is something that is casting a shadow over the case -- something that is probably my top concern.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The whole thing where APIs are kind of hard to understand &mdash; still casting a shadow over this case</p>

<p>Also pointing out what I think is true of the Oracle legal team:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none">

<p>While this might be more about bringing things down to a lower level for "normals", I think it still represents how difficult it is for people to grok what APIs are:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">jfc I think both sides have brought LITERAL PHYSICAL FILE CABINETS as visual aids to explain what a API is</p>

<p>Then continuing with more of the skeuomorph theater:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Google's has a big 8.5x11 printout propped up on it labeled "java.lang" and the top drawer is labeled "Math" in very big Arial Black letters</p>

<p>I agree with with Sarah. She's a super smart chick, and if all the theater is confusing her, I can only imagine what effect it will have on the jury. What is code, what is API, what is definition, and what actually runs, or is there to enable and facilitate&nbsp;interoperability&nbsp;is blurry when you are in the game--I cannot even image anymore what it is like for the normals.</p>
<p>The only thing that keeps me optimistic in all of this is the possibility for some API literacy lessons for the masses, amidst all the theater. I guess we have to see how it goes&nbsp;and hope there are more opportunities to help folks understand what APIs actually are.</p>

<p>I am&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthit.gov/facas/sites/faca/files/SingleSourceofTruth-APITFRecommendations.pdf">reading through the API task force recommendations</a>&nbsp;out of the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC), to help address privacy and security concerns around mandated API usage as part of the Common Clinical Data Set, Medicare, and Medicaid Electronic Health Records. The recommendations contain a wealth of valuable insights around healthcare APIs but&nbsp;are&nbsp;also full of patterns that we should be applying across other sectors of our society where APIs making an impact. To help me work through the task force's recommendations, I will be blogging through many of the different concepts at play</p>
<p>In addition to highlighting&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/05/10/the-concept-of-patientdirected-apis/">the usage of "patient-directed&nbsp;APIs" that I wrote about earlier</a>, and taking <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/05/10/a-healthy-stance-on-privacy-and-security-when-it-comes-to-healthcare-apis/">a healthy stance on privacy and security when it comes to healthcare APIs</a>, I wanted to separate out the conversation around a patent's right to access their own personal health information, and how APIs are being used as the enabler. Here is the chapter from the task force's recommendations:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Many of the discussions within the task force centered around the notion that the patient directed app of our purview supports the patient&rsquo;s HIPAA right to access his/her own PHI from a Covered Entity, as required under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/45/164.502">HIPAA &sect; 164.502</a>. </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>This could be characterized in several ways:</em></p>
<ol style="padding-left: 20px;">
<li><em>the individual requesting access to their information</em></li>
<li><em>an entity designated by the individual to receive a copy of PHI (as part of the individual exercising his/her right to access PHI)</em></li>
<li><em>the medium on which the individual requests that PHI be provided or transmitted as part of the individual exercising his/her right to obtain a copy of PHI</em></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em> Alternatively, the patient directed app may also be characterized as a third party formerly authorized by the individual to receive PHI or a tool for engaging the individual in treatmentEach of these scenarios creates challenges when attempting to determine oversight of an app&rsquo;s behavior there is not one clear solution.</em></p>
<p>I am going to educate myself about <em><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/45/164.502">HIPAA &sect; 164.502</a></em>, and get to work understanding what other precedents exist--maybe with <a href="http://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html">FERPA</a> or <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/complying-coppa-frequently-asked-questions">COPPA</a>, or other similarly regulated industries. I am just looking to understand where the lines are drawn when it comes to people having a "right to access" when it comes to their data, especially when APIs are playing a central role like they are with healthcare interoperability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have read the healthcare API task force recommendations several times now, but I am only a couple pages into when it comes to cherry picking ideas I want to consider more deeply, as well as have indexed as part of my overall API industry research. So stay tuned for continued posts about how APIs are being used to drive patient-centered&nbsp;access to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">their</span> healthcare data.</p>

<p>The next round of the Oracle v Google Java API Copyright battle has kicked off again in San Francisco after being sent back to the lower court by the United States Supreme Court. This round is all about deciding if Google's usage of the Java API in their Android platform was allowed under fair use. If I was in San Francisco I would be there to hear the case first hand--I am lucky there are some really smart folks covering the case&nbsp;and live tweeting things.</p>
<p>I went through the Tweets from&nbsp;Sarah Jeong (<a href="https://twitter.com/sarahjeong">@sarahjeong</a>), contributing editor at @Motherboard, Parker Higgins (<a href="https://twitter.com/xor">@xor</a>), EFF activist, and Mike Swift (<a href="https://twitter.com/Swiftstories">@Swiftstories</a>), Senior Correspondent for MLex. They are all providing some smart, and pretty amusing commentary on what is going on, so I wanted to organize the relevant Tweets into a Twitter collection summary for inclusion in my research.&nbsp;</p>
<div align="center" style="width: 60%; border: 0px solid #000; margin-left: 135px;">
  <a class="twitter-timeline" href="https://twitter.com/kinlane/timelines/730194899920932864" data-widget-id="730232433828724736">Oracle v Google </a>

</div>
<p>I will add more tweets to it each day of the trial, and since it's a Twitter collection, it will update here on the blog post, or if you'd rather,<a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane/timelines/730194899920932864">you can access it directly&nbsp;via Twitte</a>r. I have no idea how long this round of the case will play out, but I will definitely be tuning in, and ranting about it when I have time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know if there is anyone else covering the trial, that I should be including in the Twitter collection. I want to try and capture as complete of a record as possible, from multiple perspectives if possible. While I am bummed that the precedent for copyright has been established for APIs, I'm hopeful that we can look at this round as an API literacy opportunity. ;-)</p>

<p><span>One phrase that is used regularly across the task force recommendations that really caught my attention was the concept of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><em>"PatientDirected APIs"</em></strong></span>. It is a powerful concept, when you think about APIs existing, not just for helping integrate healthcare systems, and innovate around the development and delivery of the web and mobile applications, but doing it all because of, in service of, and at the direction of the patient. The document has grabbed my attention because this is the first time I've seen such an end-user focused API vision in the wild.</span></p>
<p><span>While these electronic healthcare record APIs will be used for system integration, delivering web and mobile apps, and benefiting healthcare platform operators, and developers, the reason for the APIs will be existing is to benefit the patient. This just isn't how things are done in Silicon Valley, where you always focus on benefits for the platform, its partners and investors first, maybe the developers secondarily, but in most cases the end-user is just an afterthought. In startup culture, things are just turned on its head, allowing for some serious imbalance in how we do things with APIs.</span></p>
<p><span>There are a wealth of topics for me to work through from the task force recommendations out of ONC and HHS. I will keep blogging, as I read through, and work through the important recommendations it contains. Once I have my head wrapped around the document more, and up to speed with&nbsp;what they are doing, I'm hoping I can contribute some more ideas that might help stimulate things as healthcare providers roll out their APIs.</span></p>

<p>How we define our APIs has dramatically changed in recent years. Since Swagger came onto the scene around five years ago, there has been a rapid growth in the number of open formats, tooling, and services to help us define APIs. Companies are using API definitions like OpenAPI Spec, Postman, and API.json to communicate about their APIs at almost every stop along the API life cycle. This is my research to better understand all the moving parts in this fast growing sector.</p>
<p><a href="http://apis.how/oq38yeqkkd">This guide</a> focuses on API definition formats like OpenAPI Spec and API Blueprint, as well as schema formats like JSON Schema, and MSON, but I also touch on media types, link relations and other common building blocks for defining our APIs so they speak a common language. While there is some open tooling included in this guide, I'm trying to focus on the specifications, and formats themselves, and help make sense of the amount of information available to us.</p>
<p>I fund my research through consulting, selling my guides, and the generous support of my sponsors. I appreciate your support in helping me continue with my work and hope you find it relevant in your API journey.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 May 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-smoke-and-mirrors.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I get brought into a lot of API discussions with IT departments from companies, institutions, and government agencies, which are often coordinated by business groups who are interested in better meeting their goals using APIs. This is often an immediately charged conversation, with IT coming to their table with a whole array of baggage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In about 75% of the situations, IT, and developer representatives are nice, or rather they are tight-lipped, relying on a myriad of smoke &amp; mirrors to defend their dark arts. Let me stop for a moment, and put out there that I was IT director from 1998 through 2010. I'm not saying IT are bad people, but there are a wide variety of ways we slow, obfuscate, and distort the conversation to be in our favor -- takes one to know one. I wouldn't say that I was 100% honest in my approach to being an IT leader, but I tried my hardest to keep things as transparent as I possibly could.</p>
<p>Anyways, in a couple of the &nbsp;IT discussions I've had lately, there was an OpenAPI Spec available to define the resources that were on the table, and in a handful of other conversation there were not. Keep in mind that most of these scenarios are with a more traditional version of IT, not with startup technology groups (a whole different beast). As I step back, I am taking notice of the harmonizing effect that an API definition can have, in keeping conversations focused, productive, and moving forward toward a common goal.</p>
<p>In the conversations without an OpenAPI Spec, back-end systems and legacy processes dominated the discussion, even though we are all on a conference call to discuss an external, partner, and public facing API. In the discussions where an OpenAPI Spec was present, we focused on exactly which resources were needed (nothing more), and the details (params, responses, etc) that were needed by all consumers--essentially providing us with a scaffolding for the discussion, that kept things moving forward, and not bogged down in legacy sludge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Backend focused discussions&nbsp;always seemed to get slowed down by what was, and what is. The API definition focused conversations seemed to focus on what was needed, using a common language that everyone at the table understood. The presence of an OpenAPI Spec seemed to cut through the smoke &amp; mirrors, which I think often alienates many of the business users. I find having three versions of an OpenAPI Spec and APIs.json file present: 1) simple outline 2) YAML and 3) JSON, was also something that significantly improved discussions, keeping conversations focused while also making them as inclusive as possible.</p>
<p>I think people will always bring their baggage to these discussions, but I'm liking the harmonization effects API definitions like OpenAPI Spec, API Blueprint, Postman, and APIs.json are having in&nbsp;these conversations. I'm hopeful that these API definitions can continue providing bridges between business and IT groups, helping close a canyon that has existed for decades.</p>

<p>I am <a href="https://www.healthit.gov/facas/sites/faca/files/SingleSourceofTruth-APITFRecommendations.pdf">reading through the API task force recommendations</a> out of t<span>he Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC), to help address privacy and security concerns around mandated API usage as part of the Common Clinical Data Set, Medicare, and Medicaid Electronic Health Records.

To help me work through the task force's recommendations, I will be blogging through many of the different concepts at play.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/05/10/the-concept-of-patientdirected-apis/">Beyond the usage of "patient-directed&nbsp;APIs" that I wrote about earlier</a>, I thought the pragmatic view on API privacy and security was worth noting. When it comes to making data, content, and other digital resources available online, I hear the full spectrum of concerns, and it leaves me optimistic to hear government agencies speak about security and privacy in such a balanced way.</p>
<p>Here is a section from the API task force recommendations:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Like any technology, APIs allow new capabilities and opportunities and, like any other technology, these opportunities come with some risks. There are fears that APIs may open new security vulnerabilities, with apps accessing patient records "for evil", and without receiving proper patient authorization. There are also fears that APIs could provide a possible "fire hose" of data as opposed to the "one sip at a time" access that a web site or email interface may provide.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In testimony, we heard almost universally that, when APIs are appropriately managed, the opportunities outweigh the risks. We heard from companies currently offering APIs that properly managed APIs provide better security properties than ad-hoc interfaces or proprietary integration technology.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">While access to health data via APIs does require additional considerations and regulatory compliance needs, we believe existing standards, infrastructure, and identity proofing processes are adequate to support patient directed access via APIs today.</p>
<p>The document is full of recommendations on how to strike this balance. It is refreshing to hear such a transparent vision of what APIs can be. They weigh the risks, alongside the benefits that APIs bring to the table&nbsp;while also being fully aware that a "properly managed API" provides its own security. Another significant aspect of these recommendations for me is that they also touch on the role that APIs will play in the regulatory and a compliance process.</p>
<p>I have to&nbsp;admit, the area of healthcare APIs isn't one of the most exciting stacks in the over 50 areas I track on across the API space, but I'm fully engaged with this because of the potential of a blueprint for privacy and security that can be applied with other types of APIs. When it comes to social, location, and other data the bar has been set pretty low when it comes to privacy and security, but health care&nbsp;data is different. People tend to be more concerned with access, security, privacy, and all the things we should already be discussing when it comes to the rest of our digital existence--opening the door for some valuable digital literacy discussions.</p>
<p>Hopefully, I don't run you off with all my healthcare API stories, and you can find some gems in the healthcare API task force's recommendations, like I am.&nbsp;</p>

After publishing my post, Runscope CEO, John Sheehan (<a href="https://twitter.com/johnsheehan">@johnsheehan</a>) said he was behind the original spec for the Twilio magic numbers.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none">

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane">@kinlane</a> I borrowed the idea from payment processors using magic numbers to generate specific kinds of outcomes like declines</p>

<p>Which I think adds another dimension to the concept of having test numbers like this. Different numbers give you different outcomes, and different credit card numbers give you different results. What else could you do with test numbers&nbsp;and unique identifiers? Existing invoice and order numbers for different commerce situations. Seems like you could load just about anything into any alpha and / or numeric that you would want to.</p>
<p>Around the turn of the century (I don't think I've ever said that) I used to work on web applications for non-profit organizations where I used to build campaign code tracking for large, and lengthy mail, phone, fax, and other types of activities. We had 6 to 8 digit identifiers, which every two digits had unique meanings--allowing us to build a pretty robust set of scenarios that helped us track every step in the campaigns evolution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyways, I think the concept is worthy of further exploration. I could see API providers crafting a pretty robust set of keys that could represent almost any object served up as part of API operations, with a very structured approach for how you tailor a multitude outcomes involving these objects. For me, this type of stuff goes way beyond just having a sandbox for your API, and could provide a much more meaningful way help developers polish their integrations.</p>

<p>As I push out stories on the next round of the Oracle v Google API copyright case, considering how I will write about API deprecations and acquisitions I'm privy to, and document the continued march by the enterprise into the world of APIs -- I begin to see how APIs will continue to wither on the vine, and never reach their full potential in an increasingly&nbsp;toxic&nbsp;environment.</p>
<p>The Oracle v Google is just the first of many battles to occur between tech giants when it comes to APIs&nbsp;and the application of intellectual property laws. With the number of patents out there that focus on APIs as the thing that is protected by IP, not just the thing behind the API being protected, the copyright of the common API patterns&nbsp;we enjoy&nbsp;will just be the tip of the iceberg. This is how the giants will battle it out, leaving the rest of us fighting for scraps in the cracks.</p>
<p>Legal tussle like what we see between Oracle&nbsp;and Google will become commonplace in the future as the enterprise&nbsp;fights for what they think is their&nbsp;"property" when it comes to integrations, collaboration, sharing, and automation. These battles will take place after this current wave of "interest in APIs" by the enterprise, where these large entities have sent their scouts out to map this uncharted (and mildly threatening) wilderness, understand what everyone is doing, and file patents based on what they see. Simplifying enterprise operations, actually innovating, or truly achieving integration is&nbsp;farthest from their mind. While we are all busy doing the work, these IP cartographers are mapping out the exhaust from our labor.</p>
<p>Alongside all of this, another shift in the winds is occurring, that will reduce some very useful, innovative, and valuable API patterns to just portfolio items of the enterprise. As VC funding cycles shift, the startups who are doing the most interesting things with APIs will have their work gobbled up by the enterprise, either through direct acquisitions, or fire sales -- in any case APIs are IP, nothing more. These winds are strong, and will not just blow away the valuable APIs, but also much of the shade trees that is needed for other APIs to flourish on the vine.</p>
<p>All of this change will sweep up this API experiment&nbsp;as we know it, into the IP portfolios of the enterprise giants, so they can use as leverage in court battles, and venture negotiations of the future. The enablement that APIs bring to the table is just too small of a thing currently for the enterprise to even see. Startups are often too greedy, or beholden to their investors to understand the opportunity they are passing on&nbsp;when they see APIs as intellectual property. API enablement is not IP, the thing they enable is IP, and by freezing up the enabling factor, you will miss out on your IP ever reaching full potential, and will be left with a vineyard of perpetually green grapes.</p>
<p>I know, I know. All my enterprise and startup friends will tell me how naive I am, and this is how business is done. Again, I will say, you are so blinded by your greed, and your belief in this broken IP systems, you are willing to kill off this very interesting experiment--where we all &nbsp;had a seat at the table. At this point, I am left without any hope, and the concept of APIs as we know it will wither on the vine, never reaching their full potential -- this API economy thing we all saw in our minds eye, will not happen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I'm gonna still keep on fighting, and pushing for APIs usage in healthcare, education, government, and other important areas. I will keep building services and tools that embrace APIs as their core, but you will rarely hear me speak of the bright, API enabled future anymore. The experiment is over, the believers in a broken IP system are winning -- they just have too much money, and resources to play the long game, and the wider API space, and the rest of us will lose out.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 May 2016</span>
        <p>I'm spending a lot of time in the Twilio API ecosystem this week, so you will hear multiple stories about what they are up to. This one is highlighting their <a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/rest/call-feedback">Call Feedback API</a> and the growing amount of what I'd consider as infrastructure APIs from leading API platforms. The more API platforms mature, the more I see APIs deployed to assist API consumers manage their integrations, as well as get a the core API resources being made available.</p>
<p>Twilio's feedback API focuses on a single API resource, a call, but could just as easily be applied equally as a quality of service feedback endpoint for anything you are serving up, like video, bot responses, recommendations, and beyond. I like the idea of having one endpoint for serving up a resource, and another endpoint for reporting the quality of service around the resource.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/twilio-call-feedback-api.png" alt="" width="98%" /></p>
<p>Now that I have filed a report on Twilio's approach to using APIs as part of their platform operations, I will be keeping a closer eye out for other platforms doing similar things. I will consider adding it to my stack of existing API infrastructure APIs, alongside access to account, application, billing, and analytics via an API.</p>
<p>As the growth of API integration continues, I will continue looking at the API pioneers for examples of how we can be providing more infrastructure focused API resources, that allow API consumers to manage, orchestrate, and automate their API integrations. As developers use a larger number of APIs to drive any single application or system integration, the need to automate accounts, apps, pricing, billing, analytics and feedback loops is only going to grow.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 May 2016</span>
        <p>One thing I look at closely when I review API platforms&nbsp;is how they approach the monetization of their API resources, and the resulting plans, pricing, and access tiers. How platforms think about, and present this aspect of their operations provide a wealth of insights into what a company's motivations are behind their API operations.</p>
<p>I found the approach by <a href="https://i.materialise.com/api/docs/upload-model-api/">3D printing API platform i.materialise</a>&nbsp;to be an interesting approach which goes beyond just charging for API access and focuses on helping API consumers align their business model with i.materialises. i.materialise presents API consumers with two possible routes, with the first being referral based, and the second being a deeper, white label relationship.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/imaterialise-business-models.png" alt="" width="95%" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://i.materialise.com/api/">i.materialise API provides consumers with access to a &nbsp;full stack of 3D printing APIs</a>, allowing you to upload your model, determine what it will cost to print, all the way to assisting you with order fulfillment, delivery, and invoicing. The i.materialise approach to API monetization is different than other APIs I talk about because it's not about paying for API access. In this situation, it's about providing API access to the manufacturing life cycle -- one that is 3D printer driven.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While I think utility-based, pay as you go API pricing represent the majority of how we approach API consumption at the moment, I think having your business model aligned, and focused on existing, tangible products and services holds a huge amount of untapped potential for APIs. I'm thinking there are endless numbers of small business out there who would benefit from the process of mapping out their product supply chain&nbsp;and service lifecycles, then the opening up of things as a simple web API--even if it is just for internal, and trusted partner use.</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 May 2016</span>
        <p>I am always on the hunt for the little things that make API integration easier, and while <a href="http://theapistack.com/certifying/">working to certify my Twilio API definition</a>, I noticed their <a href="https://www.twilio.com/user/account/phone-numbers/dev-tools/test-credentials">test credentials</a>. When you are playing with the Twilio API, it's pretty easy to add new keys, and create new apps, but they also offering test credentials along with what they call "Twilio's Magic Numbers" so that you can play without connecting to real phones or making actual charges on your account.</p>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/twilio-test-credentials.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>Many APIs provide you access to data or content, but Twilio enters the additional realm of much more complex, programmatic API resources. When getting up and going with these types of APIs, it really helps to have a sandbox to play in, and a ready to go set of test credentials provides this for users by default.</p>
<p>If you are offering up more than just data and content, via your API, you may want to follow Twilio's lead, and create a set of permanent, or even regularly changing set of test accounts for consumers to use. It made my onboarding with Twilio, significantly easier.</p>

<p>I am sure there is some equation we could come up to describe the amount of ideology and / or dogma present alongside each bit and byte of code. Something that exponentially increases with each additional line of code or MB on disk. An example of this in action, in the wilds of the API space, is the difference between an SDK for an API, and just a single sample API call.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The single API sample is the minimum viable artifact that enables you to get value from an API -- allowing you to make a single API request and receive a single API response. Very little ideology, or dogma present (its there, but just smaller quantities). Now, if an API provider provides you with a Laravel SDK in PHP, or a JAX-RS SDK in Java, and React.js SDK, I'm significantly cranking up the volume on ideology&nbsp;and dogma involved with this code. All contributing what type of technical debt I'm willing to assume along the way, with each of one my API integrations, and wider technological solutions.</p>
<p>I work hard to never hold up any single technology as an absolute solution, as there are none, but I can see a potential for the latest wave of "serverless" approaches to delivering code potentially helping us unwind some of our technical debt. Like most other areas of technology, simply choosing to go "serverless" will not provide you the relief you need, but if you are willing to do the hard work to decouple your existing code, and apply the philosophy consistently to future projects, the chances "serverless" might pay dividends in the reduction of your technical debt will increase greatly.</p>

<p>I am doing way more work on the creation of machine-readable OpenAPI Specs for APIs, indexed using machine-readable APIs.json&nbsp;files than I am the actual creation of APIs lately. About <a href="http://theapistack.com/">half of the API definitions I create are for existing APIs</a>, with <a href="http://schema.org.apis.apievangelist.com/">the rest of them describing APIs that should exist</a>. With the existing APIs, in some cases, I am creating client-side code, but mostly just focusing on a well crafted API definition. When it comes to the new API designs, I am focusing on a complete API definition, but also crafting both server-side, as well as client-side code around the definition--when needed.</p>
<p>Even when I do craft server or client code for an API definition, the value of the code is significantly lower than the definition(s). In my mind the code is disposable. I want to be able to throw it away, and start over with anything I am building, at any point. While I have made significant ideological investments into using Linux for my OS, AWS for my compute and storage hosting, MySQL for my database, and PHP + Slim for my API deployment framework, the code that operates within this framework has to be transient. Some code might end up having a long, long life, but if a piece of code isn't generating value, and in the way, I want to either get rid of it or rewrite it to better meet the requirements.</p>
<p>When it comes to delivering technology in my world, my investments are increasingly in the API definitions, underlying data schemas, and the data and content that is actually stored and transmitted within. The PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML is valuable, but a second class citizen to the JSON, and YAML representations of my APIs, schemas, and the valuable data and content stored. For me personally, having made significant investments in a variety of tech solutions historically, this provides me with the flexibility I need to live in the current online climate. This is something that only has been coming into focus in the last year, so I assume it will also continue to evolve in focus over the next couple of years, but I am already seeing significant returns from my investing in definitions over the code when it comes to my API strategy.</p>

<p>There are many different ways to actually deploy an API. If you are a larger, more established company, you probably have existing&nbsp;tools, services, and processes set forth by IT for deploying APIs. If you are a startup, your developers probably have their own frameworks, or possibly a cloud service they prefer using. <a href="http://apis.how/luztdufwj0">This guide looks to map out the world of API deployment</a>, and some of the common ways companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies are deploying APIs in 2016.</p>
<p>This <a href="http://apis.how/luztdufwj0">API deployment guide</a> breaks out many of the common companies, and tools while also looking to identify some of the common building blocks employed by leading providers, in support of API deployment across organizations of all shapes and sizes. This research is conducted by API Evangelist and is the just aspect of a modern API lifecycle, one that includes over 50 stops, from API design to deprecation, with deployment being just one area you should be considering.</p>
<p>I work to update my guides regularly, and if purchase a copy, you'll get any updates to it for the next year. Every reader of API Evangelist guides helps support this research and enables the work to continue--thank you!</p>

<p>I have been tracking on <a href="http://university.stack.network/">how APIs are used in higher education</a> for some time now, keeping an eye on almost <a href="http://university.stack.network/universities/">50 campus API related efforts</a>. I have my <a href="http://apis.how/qxhdqghp4a">University API guide</a>&nbsp;that I regularly update, but I was eager to push forward my storytelling around what is going on, so I have been working on some papers telling the story behind some of the top higher ed API implementations which I have access to.</p>
<p>What better way to kick this off, than to showcase my favorite campus API group, over at <a href="https://home.byu.edu/home/">Brigham Young University (BYU)</a>. The team led by CIO Kelly Flanagan (<a href="https://twitter.com/kelflanagan">@kelflanagan</a>) have embraced APIs on campus in a way that keeps my excited about APIs, and what is possible. In my opinion, BYU isn't just using APIs to shift IT strategy at the school, they are using APIs to shift how their students and faculty see technology, and put it to work on their terms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm pretty familiar with what has been happening at BYU when it comes to APIs, as I see Kelly and his team regularly, but I jumped on a Google Hangout with them, so that I could get the latest. The results is a short five page essay, about the history of the API efforts on campus, some of the benefits to faculty and students, and a glimpse at the future of APIs at the school.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://apis.how/adazaak60a">The paper is freely available for you to download as PDF</a>, but I will also be working on some stories that I used&nbsp; the paper, as part of my regularly blogging here on API Evangelist. I want to keep bringing attention to what they are up to at BYU, but also generate attention at other schools about what is possible when it comes to APis. As I note in the paper, I'm also working with Davidson College in North Carolina, and will be working to keep spreading the conversation to other schools.</p>
<p>You can find me speaking at University of California in San Diego this June, so stay tuned for more information about how APIs are used in higher ed this summer--showcasing my conversations with BYU, Davidson, and UCSD, as examples of how APIs are making an impact in higher education.</p>

<p>I am always working as hard as I can to develop as complete as possible OpenAPI Specs for the APIs that I monitor. I call this <a href="http://theapistack.com/">my API Stack research</a>. When possible, in addition to mapping out API operations for an API using <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, I also work to create a machine readable OpenAPI Spec for each API.</p>
<p>In most cases I only have the time to profile the surface area of an API -- the host, base url, all properties, and required parameters. I don't always have time to reach what I'd consider to be a complete API definition. This is something that takes authenticating, achieving a successful request and response for each endpoint present, then generating JSON schema for each response -- this takes a significant amount of effort to do properly.</p>
<p>Thankfully in addition to investing in this work myself, I am also getting the assistance of my partners like&nbsp;<a href="http://apis.how/bgdteovduo">Dream Factory</a>, who are interested in getting specific API definitions completed, and make sure they have complete API definitions for the leading APIs out there today. Here are a handful of them I'm working on producing this week:</p>

<p>I've assigned each API its own Github repo to store the OpenAPI Specs, as well as indexing them using APIs.json, and facilitating the conversation using the Github issues. My goal is to streamline the process of making sure all the endpoints are represented, and a complete definition for both the request and the response exists--while keeping an eye on the future, in a potentially crowd sourced, Github-centric way.</p>
<p>If there is an API you'd like to see get completed, let me know. I am happy to prioritize other APIs after this. My goals it to focus a dedicated amount of time each week to this, but unfortunately this takes money, so I'm looking to get investment from partners, and the general community to help make sure happens. If you want to help, feel free to ping me, and let me know what you need.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/05/02/http-header-awareness-using-the-link-header-for-pagination/">I was learning more about using the Link header for pagination yesterday</a>, as part of<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/31/gathering-my-thoughts-about-open-referral-and-the-human-services-api/"> my work on the Human Services Data Specification (HSDS)</a>, and this approach to putting hypermedia links in the header got me thinking about other possibilities. Part of the reason I was considering using the Link header for pagination on this particular project was that I was looking to alter the existing schema as little as possible -- I liked that I could augment the response with links, using the header.</p>
<p>Another side thought I had along the way were around the possibilities for using it to augment 3rd party APIs, and APIs from an external vantage point. It wouldn't be too hard route API requests through a proxy, which could add a header with a personalized set of links tailored for each API request. If the request was looking up flights, the links could be to value add services that might influence the decision like links to hotels, events, and other activities. If you were looking up the definition of a word, the links could be to synonyms--endless possibilities.</p>
<p>You wouldn't have to just use it for pagination, and other common link relations, you could make it more about discovery, search, or even serendipity injected from outside sources. Anyways, I think the fact that you can augment an existing response using a header opens up a lot of possibilities for adding hypermedia behaviors to existing APIs. It might also be an interesting way to introduce existing API owners to hypermedia concepts, by showing them the value that can be added when you provided valuable links.</p>

<p>As <a href="http://theapistack.com/">my API Stack</a> work gets more attention, folks are reaching out to me to see if I have done certain APIs, or see if I'd prioritize some of the ones already on the list. One thing I'm also noticing is that people are often looking for the JSON schema of each of the API responses, just as much as they are looking for the OpenAPI Spec for the API surface area.</p>
<p>I had someone looking for the <a href="http://stack.apievangelist.com/companies.html">complete schema for the Reddit API</a> today, while I was&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/05/02/working-to-establish-a-complete-openapi-spec-for-leading-apis/">working to authenticate, and record the responses to each endpoint for&nbsp;AngelList, AlchemyAPI, CenturyLink, NTT Docomo, Stripe, Twilio, and Verizon</a>. An OpenAPI Spec for the request structure of an API will get you a long ways in on boarding and learning about an API, but you will need the schema to complete any integration.</p>
<p>This is one of the reason I'm working to establish a better process for certifying that an OpenAPI Spec is complete, because without the definitions, providing a JSON schema, will only get you part way--still so much work to be done. This is why API service providers are looking to have it defined, because a complete spec is what will be used to map to other systems, tools, and services.</p>
<p><a href="http://schema.org.apis.apievangelist.com/">After spending a couple days going through Schema.org</a>, and working on the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/31/gathering-my-thoughts-about-open-referral-and-the-human-services-api/">Human Services Data Specification (HSDS)</a>, I'm feeling the gravity of having common, machine readable schema available for the industry to work from. I've spent a number of cycles in the last two years creating OpenAPI Specs for APIs, but often stopping short of requiring the JSON schema to be present. From here forward, I will equally prioritize the response schema --it is proving to be just as valuable as the response described using OpenAPI Spec.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2016/05/02/http-header-awareness-using-the-link-header-for-pagination/">HTTP Header Awareness: Using The Link Header For Pagination</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">02 May 2016</span>
        <p><a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/#pagination"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/github-link-header.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I was revisiting the concept of pagination for a specific project I am working, and after consulting my API research, I came up with a suitable approach using a Link Header. Beyond applying this in my specific project, I thought the usage of the header for pagination would be a suitable topic for helping with HTTP header awareness -- a topic I will be writing about regularly, to help folks be more aware of useful approaches to using HTTP headers.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/#pagination">Github has the best example of using the link header for pagination that I could find</a>. Github uses the&nbsp;Link response header to hold a handful of Hypermedia link relations including next, last, first, and prev. Providing a nice way to handle not just pagination, but potentially any other related action you might want to take around an API response. It also provides a way to augment link relations to any existing API design, without adding to the actual response body -- which is one reason I decided to use it for my existing project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>HTTP headers are a critical aspect of API integration, and an area that I feel many developers are lacking awareness of. Which is why I will be working harder to write up simple uses like Link header for pagination, that can help API providers, as well as API consumers better use common HTTP header patterns. To be clear, the Link header is not unique to Github, and is something that is <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988#page-6">articulated in RFC 5988 for web linking</a>. Something I will add as a tooling to my API design research, so it can be considered as part of an overall <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">API design toolbox</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">30 Apr 2016</span>
        <p>I was playing with <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/catalog/">Microsoft's API Catalog</a>, a tool to visualize and analyze the API overlap between standards specifications and type systems within browsers, and their footer caught my eye. I am always looking for quality examples of companies doing platform communications and support well, and I think their layout, and <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks/">available building blocks</a> in their footer, is worthy of showcasing.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/catalog/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/api-monitoring-microsoft.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>For me, these numbers, and the available communication and support building blocks, send the right signals--that a platform is alive and active. These are the data points I tune into, to understand how well a platform is doing, or not doing. There are no absolutes when it comes to this type of monitoring, as anything can be gamed, but sign Github activity, road map evolution, and blog storytelling can provide a vital heartbeat for any healthy API platform.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We are picking up speed with the planning for <a href="http://boston2016.apistrat.com/">@APIStrat in Boston this November</a>, and with the <a href="http://boston2016.apistrat.com/program-committee/">event committee assembled</a>, and the <a href="http://boston2016.apistrat.com/call-for-talks/">call for talks open</a>, we are looking at what the possible topics are for sessions. We have seeded the list with the usual suspects like API design, management, testing, monitoring, and others, but we want to also consider what the alternative topics are, and what is relevant to the API sector in 2016.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is most important to you in 2016? Is it the trendier topics like bots, voice, and IoT? Is it more practical things like evangelism, versioning, and discovery? Is it the technical, business, or politics of APIs that are impacting your operations most in 2016? If you want to come and present on it, <a href="http://boston2016.apistrat.com/call-for-talks/">make sure you submit your talk by May 20th</a>. Otherwise you are welcome to <a href="https://twitter.com/apistrat">tweet at us</a>, <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0e6f7e677d7a7c6f7a4e3d7d6d6f626b20606b7a">email at us</a>, write a blog post, commit to a Github repo, or any other way you desire--we'll add into the mix, for the event committee to review.</p>
<p>It is a lot of work to make sure @APIStrat keeps reflecting the wider API movement after 3 years, and we depend on you keeping us informed. I'm enjoying the fact that we are only doing one event this year, as it is giving us more lead time to engage in discussions with the community, and continue making it an inclusive event. Another thing I'd like to hear about from y'all, is what is relevant to Boston, something I'm sure I will learn more about as I continue my profiling of Boston area businesses.&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Apr 2016</span>

<p>The relationship between API provider and consumer is a fragile one. As an API provider I am offering up my valuable digital asset, data, content, and digital resources. I would like you to take this Application Programming Interface or SDK that I have built, and put it in your business systems and applications. As an API consumer, I'm given access to valuable business API asset, which I'm expected use in a respectful way, that is always in alignment with a providers terms of service -- an environment where so much can go wrong, and does each day.</p>
<p>I watch companies take a wide range of tones when it comes to setting the stage for this relationship. Some companies are super protective of their valuable content (like Marvel Comics), some are very communicative and inviting like Slack (inject your bot into us). where others wobble between a more open, the back to strict, like Twitter has done over the last couple years. In my opinion, it comes down to how you see your digital resources, and your belief in intellectual property -- when I you, I mean you and your investors.</p>
<p>I try NOT to read all the patent notifications that come into my reader, as it fucking depresses me, but everyone once in a while I have to revisit to help remind everyone, what an illness patents will be, when it comes to APIs working. This fragile relationship I speak of above, operates well, or not very well, depending on how loose, or how much friction exists at this layer. There are plenty of examples out there of APIs who do not do well when they restrict, or too heavily meter API consumers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help build an image in your mind. Imagine the Twitter API, and all the apps that have been built on it. OK, now add in Stripe for payments, Dropbox for storage, Instagram for Images, Facebook for Social, Amazon EC2 for compute, and YouTube for videos. Now, think about enforcing copyright on every API design, and patent licensing on each process involved. It will grind these billion dollar revenue engines to a screeching halt. Nobody will build on these platforms if they have to bake your legal heavy design, and process into their business.</p>
<p>Modern web APIs are balance between the technical, business, and politics of how data, content, and algorithms are exchanged. Simple, ubiquitous web technology is working on the technical side of things. Simple, pay as you go, utility based, and tiered access is helping strike balance on the business side of things. TOS, privacy, security, transparency are the knobs and dials of the political side of things, let's not willingly invite in something so invasive, like patents into the API layer. Patent your algorithm, copyright your content, and license your data, but keep the API definition copyright free, and your API process patent free.</p>
<p>In the <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=9,280,678.PN.&amp;OS=PN/9,280,678&amp;RS=PN/9,280,678">"secure cloud storage distribution and aggregation"</a> patent I'm reading this morning, its not the patent that offends me. It is the patent being so focused on the API being the thing that makes the patent. Patent how you index, search, and secure your file storage wizardry, but the API design, and operations should NOT be a focal point of your patent. You want people to integrate with your "secure cloud storage distribution and aggregation", bake the API design and process into their businesses, you want the cloud storage industry to speak your API -- don't lock it down, otherwise API consumers will look elsewhere.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Apr 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-storytelling.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+MikeAmundsen/posts/9d8QTVVDuJd">I was reminded by my friend Mike Amundsen of the importance of storytelling in our world</a>. When I am asked by anyone doing APIs, what is the most important thing they should be doing, my answer is always "storytelling". I don't care if its internally, publicly, on the corporate blog, or your personal blog, tell the story of what you are doing. I do not care how good your API is, if you aren't telling the story of this, nobody is going to care.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I hold up storytelling as the most important tool in your toolbox within developer groups, they often snicker, dismissing it. I also have a contingent of my NOT fanbase in the API space who love to dismiss me with -- nobody reads or cares about stories! I'm never phased by these folks, my focus is on the people who are truly trying to build community, and reach their intended audience. #NoHaterz</p>
<p>While stories swirl all around is many forms, the one I like to reference the most, is when it comes to the mating ritual that is startup funding. If you are looking to get funding for your startup, you have to be sending the right signals, otherwise your VC mate will never be interested in you. You will need to be on TechCrunch, Venture Beat, and other tech blogs. Hacker News, Reddit and Hacker News needs to be in sync. Your stories should also be in sync with what is floating around VC firm blogs, aggregate, and other investor related streams.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Startup valuations are are defined by an ocean of stories crashing on the shore each day. Bots are a thing because of storytelling. We are focusing on selling to the enterprise and abandoning B2C solutions because of storytelling. Google loves them some moonshot storytelling. Elon Musk understand the importance of the right story at the right time. Stories of what people are using. Stories of what people are investing in. Stories of what the future will hold, and will be a 20B industry by 2020.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is marketing Kin! I'd put it in the fiction section of the library if I was in charge, but I'm not. Its all storytelling. If you need another example, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/">visit my secret to Amazon's success post</a>. This story does 2K page views a month, and I've seen it referenced in keynotes, framed on the wall of a bank, and on the home page of a federal agencies internal portal. This story is more fiction than it is fact, yet it keeps on resonating with folks, getting passed around, and turning people on to the concept of APIs, and why they are important.</p>
<p>Please keep telling your story, if for no other reason, so that I have stories to retell. ;-)</p>

<p><a href="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/?doc">I came across the Wikimedia Unique Devices data set, which also is served up as an API endpoint, along with the other APIs the platform offers</a>. The data set and API provides access to a list of unique devices that have visited Wikipedia, for a specific period of time.</p>
<p>The data set and API only has data back to January currently, but I'm sure is something that will evolve over time. I really like the fact that we have organizations who are operating at scale, and are open and willing to share their data. This type of information is high value, and is something that can help us all better understand the ever shifting digital landscape around us--thank you Wikimedia for making accessible.</p>
<p>While playing with their <a href="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/?doc">Unique Device API</a>, I also noticed how transparent they are with their page view data, also making it available as simple set of API endpoints.

<p>I am <a href="http://apis.how/3bjch3csvo">working with my partner Cloud Elements</a> to build out a community of evangelists, who are interested in delivering on <a href="http://evangelism.apievangelist.com/building-blocks/">many of the essential building blocks I track on when it comes to API evangelism</a>. I get regular requests from companies who are looking for evangelism and advocacy resources -- in desperate need of smart folks who can help craft content, crank out code, in the service of evangelizing a platform.</p>
<p>The work I'm doing with Cloud Elements, is the early work to help deliver on what API providers, and service providers are needing. Right now we are on-boarding new folks to the concept, and getting feedback on what some of the common elements, and challenges will be. One of the folks I'm engaging with on this is expert PHP and API developer, tech lead, author, consultant and open source maintainer, Lorna Mitchell (<a href="https://twitter.com/lornajane">@lornajane</a>).</p>
<p>Lorna is one of several folks I've been working with to help deliver on API Evangelist projects ranging from blog, and white papers, to training, and how-to guides. If you are a PHP developer, <a href="http://www.lornajane.net/?s=git&amp;submit=Search">have been learning about Git and Github in the last couple of years you have probably come across Lorna's work</a>. I was talking to my friend Mark Body on Skype today, and mentioned Lorna and he said oh yeah, I've used her Git training materials before, in my stories and talks -- something I echoed as well, having pointed my readers and clients to her training materials regularly.</p>
<p>After five years of doing what I call hacker storytelling, writing code, JSON, and stories about APIs, I understand how much hard work goes into creating content that is educational and simple, focused on very technical topics like APIs, while also driving search engine traffic over long periods of time. Lorna has done very well these areas,crafting blog posts that will keep being surfaced in Google searches for a long time to come, and help walk people through some very lofty technical concepts--wave after wave.</p>
<p>If you are needing help with storytelling as part of your industry, or API platform, let me know. I'm happy to see where I can help. Feel free to reach out to Lorna as well, she is looking to help the right companies and platforms craft white papers, guides, training and tutorials. If you are an evangelist who is looking to do the same, let me know, and I'm also happy to plug you into the community we are assembling, and see where you can help deliver. If you want to test drive some of first tasks and challenges we have going on in the beta phase, you are welcome to sign up on your own at&nbsp;<a href="https://cloudelements.influitive.com/join/dev032016">Mt.

<p>One of the side effects of the recent bot craze, is that I'm getting to showcase the often very healthy API practices of Slack, as they grow, scale, and manage their developer ecosystem. Slack is beginning to renew my faith that there are API providers out there who give a shit, and aren't just looking to exploit their ecosystems. There are two Slack blog posts that have triggered these thoughts, <a href="https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/the-slack-platform-roadmap-34067b054177#.mhuax8lrn">one on the Slack platform road map</a>, and <a href="https://slackhq.com/a-little-thing-about-release-notes-997d2e06842d#.hmmeyia86">a little thing about release notes</a>, both of which reflect what I would love to see other API providers emulate in their platform operations.</p>
<p>Slack is going the extra mile to set the right tone in their community, with what I consider to be some of the essential communication building blocks of API operations, but they simply call <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"keep in touch"</strong></span>:</p>

<p>I just copied and pasted that from their developer portal. Slack does not stop there, also providing an&nbsp;<a title="Frequently asked questions" href="https://api.slack.com/faq">FAQ</a>, a&nbsp;<a href="https://api.slack.com/docs/community-code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://trello.com/b/HPpcIqd8/slack-app-ideaboard" target="_blank">Ideaboard</a>&nbsp;to further set the tone for how things can and should work in a community. What I like about the tone Slack is taking, is that it is balanced--"keep in touch"! Which really is just as much about us API consumers, as it is about Slack. Slack has done the hard work of providing most of the essential API building blocks, as well as a valuable API resource, now its up to the community to deliver--this balance is important, and we should be staying in touch.</p>
<p>Remember the tone Twitter took with us? Developer Rules of the Road!! Very different tone than "keep in touch". The tone really matters, as well as the investment in the common building blocks that enable "keeping in touch", both synchronous, and asynchronously. Having a road map, and change log for your API goes a long way, but telling the behind the why, how, and vision behind your road map and change log--gives me hope that this API thing might actually work.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite popular belief in Silicon Valley, there are many different ways to fund the design, development, deployment, and operation of valuable API resources. Not all APIs are destined to be the next Amazon, Twitter, or even Twilio. Some APIs just need exist, be available, and will never be a revenue engine--one of these APIs is the <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/api/bulk-info/#judge-data">Court Listener API.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/">Version 3.0 of the Court Listener API possesses 15 valuable endpoints</a>, providing access to&nbsp;courts, dockets, opinions, people, sources, ratings, and other details about how laws are made in the United States. <a href="https://free.law/2016/04/19/judicial-database-announcement/">With their latest release containing a comprehensive database of judges and the judiciary, to be linked to Court Listener&rsquo;s corpus of legal opinions authored by those judges</a>.</p>
<p>Increasingly APIs like Court Listener, and the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/31/gathering-my-thoughts-about-open-referral-and-the-human-services-api/">Human Services Data Specification (HSDS) API</a>, are capturing my attention. These types of APIs represent the type of impact I'm looking to make using APIs, going beyond what APIs can do for a single application or industry, but what they can do for wider sections of our society. Focusing on getting agile, nimble, and more efficient in how craft laws in our country, and how we make sure people are fed, and find the government services they need in their life.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/donate/">The Court Listener API depends on grants, and donations to operate</a>, which is an approach I will be showcasing more when it applies to APIs that deliver valuable human, civic, and research related resources. APIs like the Court Listener API provide an important window into how our local, state, and federal judicial system is operating (or not), and will need our financial support to do what they do. Which I think is a very viable approach to designing, deploying, and operating APis -- that is, if we all step up and support these efforts.</p>

<p>I am using my <a href="http://minimum.viable.api.operations.definition.apievangelist.com/">minimum viable API operations definition tool</a> to continue profiling the API sector, this time to size up the Slack API community. Slack is kind of a darling of the API space, so it kind of seem silly to profile them, but profiling those who are doing this API think right, is what API Evangelist all about--whether I follow the hype or not.</p>
<p>Using my minimum viable API definition, I went through the Slack API portal looking for what I'd consider to be the essential building blocks that any modern API platform should have.</p>

<p>Performing better than <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/04/21/sizing-up-the-imaterialise-3d-printing-api-with-my-minimum-viable-api-operations-definition/">the review of the i.Materialise 3D printing API</a> that I conducted the other day, Slack checks off all but one of the essential building blocks-everything except for pricing. The only other area(s) that I find deficient, is when it comes to machine readable API definitions like OpenAPI Spec and Postman Collections. These aren't required for success, but they can sure go a long ways in helping developers on-board from documentation, to generating code, and tooling that will be needed for integration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm assuming Slack hasn't generated OpenAPI Specs because they have a more XML-RPC design, which I think many folks assume can't be documented in this way. While it doesn't lend itself to more easily being documented with OpenAPI Spec, I found some simple little hacks that make it doable, allowing you to also document even XML-RPC designs. Having some OpenAPI Specs and Postman Collections would make the API more accessible for people looking to play with.</p>
<p>Anyways, I just wanted to test out the <a href="http://minimum.viable.api.operations.definition.apievangelist.com/">minimum viable API operations tool</a> on another API. I am trying to profile several APIs in this way each week, helping the number of APIs I am monitoring grow, while also encouraging other API providers to follow Slack's lead.</p>

        <span class="post-date">25 Apr 2016</span>
        <p><a href="https://schema.org"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/schema-org/schema-org.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I am gearing up for another wave of <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">API definition</a> work, so I am taking the opportunity to produce some more tooling that assists me in the process. One of the tools I want to build, is a simple solution for walking me through one or many OpenAPI Specs, and push me to make sure every parameter has a complete set of descriptions. I possess amazing powers of bullshit, and can craft default description for almost anything I come across, but it would be nice to have an an ever evolving autocomplete dictionary to augment my existing super powers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I already have <a href="http://apis.json.autocomplete.apievangelist.com/">an APIs.json driven autocomplete tool, that loops through all the parameters within the OpenAPI Specs that are indexed</a>. I just needed a rich set of fields and parameters to pull from -- <a href="https://schema.org">Schema.org</a>. The rich vocabulary that is Schema.org possesses 992 properties across 642 schema types. I've long wanted to craft OpenAPI Specs for Schema.org, but needed a reason to help push things forward, and this is a perfect opportunity to kick things off.</p>
<p><a href="http://schema.org.apis.apievangelist.com/">As a starting point, I created 642 separate OpenAPI Specs</a>. One for each of the schema types. I already have an API that will generate an OpenAPI Spec from any JSON schema, building out GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods, as well as a default 200 response, and connecting it to the schema for the API response definition. As I was doing the work I realized that I didn't want to limit the OpenAPI Specs to just the JSON version, so as I generated I also published a YAML version.</p>
<p><a href="http://schema.org.apis.apievangelist.com/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/schema-org-api-definitions.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>Next I'm going to use <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist-tools/schema-org-openapi-specs/tree/gh-pages/api-commons">these 642 OpenAPI Specs as an autocomplete index</a> for helping me quickly fluff up the parameters of other existing API definitions. Next I'll work on wiring up the hierarchies and relationships present in the Schema.org definitions. Right now, none of the OpenAPI Specs will validate as the parameter types aren't all valid, but I didn't want to lose the object references.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond being an autocomplete index which I can use across my micro tools for working with API definitions, I am thinking this Schema.org work will bear a shit ton of fruit in future work. I would like to have API implementations for many of the more common Schema.org types, allowing me to help folks design, and deploy Schema.org compliant APIs. Something that I feel will go a long way to help stabilize and standardize APIs, by helping them speak using a more common vocabulary.</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Apr 2016</span>
        <p><a href="http://apis.json.annotation.apievangelist.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/apis-json-annotation.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I am working on <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/04/09/playing-with-one-possible-openapi-spec-for-the-human-services-data-specification-hsds/">one possible API definition for the Human Services Definition Specification (HSDS)</a>, and the next phase of this work involves bringing in a small group of technical, and non-technical folks to have discussions around their API designs, in context of the master specification I am looking to pull together.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help drive the discussion I am wanted to use the <a href="http://adopta-agency.github.io/open-referral-api/api-commons/openapi-spec.json">OpenAPI Specification that I created for HSDS</a>, and I also knew I wanted to use Github issue management to help keep track of the synchronous, and asynchronous conversation that would occur around it. However Github tends to have a perceived barrier to entry for many non-developers (which I don't fully get), so I wanted to leverage the platform, but also soften the way everyone discussed the overall specification, as well as each individual endpoint.</p>
<p>The HSDS specification is pretty verbose, and I needed a way to have conversations at the high level, but also down to the endpoint level. To help facilitate this, I got to work on a<a href="http://apis.json.annotation.apievangelist.com/"> prototype micro tool which enables a conversation around any API(s) that are indexed within an APIs.json file</a>, producing a human readable list of endpoints, parameters, etc., but then uses Github issue management as the core of the conversation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Resulting in <a href="http://apis.json.annotation.apievangelist.com/">my APIs.json Annotation tool</a>. It is just a first draft, so there will be a lot of changes that need to occur. I'm going to test it against 20+ APIs.json collections I have defined as part of <a href="http://theapistack.com">my API Stack</a> work to try and harden it a little bit. My APIs.json Annotation tool runs in my single repo app style, leveraging Jekyll + Github Pages + Github API to operate--Github is the front and backend.</p>
<p>Anyone can view the conversation, but if you want to participate you have to be added to the Github repository, and pass in a <a href="https://github.com/settings/tokens">Github personal token</a>. This is something I often automate with a simple Github login, where I use <a href="http://OAuth.io">OAuth.io to obtain token</a>, but I kind of see the token as a minimum viable investment to understanding Github for using each tool.</p>
<p>It is really important to me that each app stands on its own feet. Not all of my micro tools that I develop in this way will enjoy zero outside dependencies, but most of them can be easily forked, and ran in any Github user account or org (with little or no setup). Conversations around API is just one area I am looking to simulate with this approach to delivering tooling, and specifically APIs.json tooling, that can be used throughout an API life cycle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are welcome to play with <a href="http://apis.json.annotation.apievangelist.com/">the APIs.json Annotation</a>, or any <a href="http://apievangelist.com">of the other tools I have listed on my home page</a>. I will keep adding them here, so that they can be found, but like all my work they are all a work in progress. <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist-tools">Each tool has its own dedicated repo and issue management</a>, where you are welcome to join in the conversation around the road map for each one. I am just looking to develop a robust toolbox of small micro tools that will help be more successful across the life cycle of the APIs I am working on, but maybe you can benefit using them too.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-cross-origin-resource-sharing-cors.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I tend to only work in environments where I have full control over the server, so Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is never really an issue for any of the APIs I have control over, but is a pervasive problem for APIs, and JSON files I come across on the web. This is one of the reasons I really enjoy the fact that I publish all of my JSON driven, hacker storytelling projects using Github Pages and Jekyll.</p>
<p>In the last couple weeks I have been working on a bunch of micro tools that deliver specific functionality which can then be used throughout the API life cycle. All of these apps are developed using JavaScript, and depend on being able to read from any number of JSON file stores. Sometimes these files are stored within the project, but most likely I'm calling the remote JSON files of other projects, something that depends on the sharing of resources across domains.</p>
<p>If I am publishing a JSON file publicly on the open Internet, I want it to be accessible from anywhere. CORS has to be default. The speed, and agility at which I'm able to ingest and work with APIs.json files, and the OpenAPI Spec indexes they contain, sets me up for some serious nimbleness across my work.</p>
<p>If you are working with open data on the web, make sure and consider the CORS enablement by default when working with your JSON data on Github. It will make your life easier, as well as anyone else who will be looking to consume the valuable data you are putting out there.</p>

<p>I'm always on the hunt for like-minded folks who I can partner with, and bring needed products, services, and tools to the API space. If someone is selling something to the API space, its likely I have had a conversation with them about the sector at some point. I always enjoy these regular encounters, but its the handful of them that continue, and evolve into deeper relationships that I enjoy the most.</p>
<p>One of most recent relationship which I have been cultivating, is with a new <a href="https://www.hitchhq.com/">API startup called Hitch</a>. I have a long history with both the founders Bruno Pedro (<a href="https://twitter.com/bpedro">@bpedro</a>) and Luke Miller (<a href="https://twitter.com/lukeam">@lukeam</a>), in their previous lives with API Changelog and <a href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a>, but began talking with them more heavily bout their vision for Hitch earlier this year. I have spent considerable time with Luke and Bruno discussing the current state of the API life cycle, from design to deprecation, helping contribute to their vision and road map in any way that I can.</p>
<p>As Hitch prepares to shift into higher gear, helping API providers build community, the Hitch team asked me to join the team in an advisory capacity. I am always happy to share my thoughts, experience, and views on the space, but I'm stoked for the opportunity to help advise them on their road map. As Hitch evolves, you'll hear me tell more stories about the solutions they are bringing to the API life cycle. I'm hoping I can influence what they bring to the API life cycle, while also using them as another valuable source of stories about the API space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hitch is just getting going so there isn't much for me to focus on yet, but I'm looking forward to continue sharing my research with the team, to help them in any way I can. I just wanted to put it out there that I was involved, and turn up the volume my public storytelling about building community, and the API life cycle in preparation for what Hitch is bringing to table. I'm looking forward to being part of what is cooking over at Hitch--stay tuned!</p>

        <span class="post-date">22 Apr 2016</span>

<p>I was just participating in an interesting conference call about multiple API implementations, which are putting the <a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/OpenReferral/blob/master/Human%20Services%20Data%20Specification%20%20v1.0.md">Human Services Definition Specification (HSDS)</a> to use. The call was brought together discuss a shift in the current path one of the projects was taking, which involved using <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/search/">Azure Search Service</a>, and whether or not the original vendor solution was still necessary, because the cloud solution appeared to meet all their needs.</p>
<p>I sat and listened to the pros and cons of each approach. Why Azure allowed them to quickly meet the project needs, and could scale. Why the other vendor solution had a more holistic view of the problem, and shared the investment from many implementations. I had nothing to offer. The only common ground I had was around the already established schema for delivering human services. I didn't have any awareness of each individual project, the resources and skills available each group possessed, or a belief in any particular cloud platform, database solution, or programming language.</p>
<p>While Azure, and the other vendor approach dominated the first part of the conversation, everyone one on the call was in agreement around HSDS driving everyone's schema, while also agreeing were missing a common approach to defining and delivering the API. The vendor on the call was working on the next version of their API which used the HSDS format, with the Azure driven solution spoke HSDS as well. To add to the mix, I am also working on two additional implementations that will also be speaking HSDS--we all just needed a common approach to defining the API.</p>
<p>As the next step, I suggested scheduling another call, where I walk through <a href="http://developer.open.referral.adopta.agency/">the API definition I am applying to my projects</a>, providing a YAML version of my OpenAPI Spec definition. I prefer using YAML, to help lower the cognitive barrier to entry for business users of the group, demonstrating how OpenAPI Spec can be used by everyone to quantify each individual API, but in a way that we can share, discuss, and reuse--helping establish a harmony in design across all of our implementations.</p>
<p>I always work hard to not set the bar to high when it comes to the magical powers of <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">API definitions</a> have when it comes to facilitating API discussions between technical and business groups, but the benefits in situations like this are clear. I feel API definitions have the potential to help folks unpack the dogma (and insecurities) we all possess around the architectural decisions we have made, the programming languages we are using, and the cloud platforms that are increasingly depending on. Continuing to demonstrate for me the ways that APIs can help facilitate how we work together, with API definitions acting as a machine readable specification that can help us define what is needed by everyone at the table.</p>

        <span class="post-date">22 Apr 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 5px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-personal-api-decisions.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="http://bionicteaching.com/a-bit-more-on-the-personal-api/">My friend Tom Woodward is continuing his personal API journey on his blog</a>, sharing more of his thoughts around taking control over his information, and sharing some of the conversational exhaust that his journey has generated. The conversation around what what is "personal API", is where the value in all of this for me, something that is full of endless perspectives, and views of what APIs do. Which is one of the things I truly love about APIs, as they mean so many different things to different folks.</p>
<p>As i mentioned before, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/16/personal-api-are-not-just-a-local-destination-they-are-a-journey/">when I mention the concept of personal API to some of my engineering friends</a>, they seem to always focus on people designing, developing, and operating an API stack on their own server, or at home. The recent post from Tom, focuses around a comment from our other friend Alan, who commented on his previous post, talking about the process of personal API being, "a bit binary (reclaim or &ldquo;let it burn&rdquo;)". I'm thinking Alan's perspective has been strongly influenced by Tom's heavy "reclaim" desires, as well as two other friends, who have embarked on similar journeys.</p>
<p>I'm endlessly intrigued by the dimensions of personal API that people are drawn into, and focus on. That personal API is about hosting or managing your API, or just about getting your information out of someones platform. When I read Tom's post, I actually do not see local or cloud, reclaim or let it burn, I see Tom working to understanding what information he generates online, understand the tradeoff's around the platform where this information lives, then logically making decisions around how he manage this. Sure this might involve abandoning platforms, and could involve setting up some self-hosted APIs, but more often it will not.</p>
<p>I can't help but think Alan might be missing some details of his own personal API journey, as a result of his focus on his friends. When we focus to heavily on a specific aspect of API enablement (migration), I find people tend to miss many of the other benefits also occurring. I'm guessing that many the reasons that went into his original adoption of Flickr, feeling like he can rely on it, and his lack of interest in ever leaving the platform, were most likely API influenced. APIs have have made Flickr a a ubiquitous tool in our lives, allowing the community to share photos using <a href="http://oembed.com/">oEmbed</a>, develop valuable syndication, upload, and other useful solution, including WordPress integrations, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.flickr.com/tools/aperture">tools like Aperture</a>--APIs have been shaping everyone's decision to use the photo sharing platform for many years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the reasons I keep using the phrase personal API, is because of how people respond to it, view it, and accept of reject it. To me, personal API involves having my own hosted API stack, depending on 3rd party APIs (my personal storage API is Amazon S3 &amp; Dropbox), to host, sync, share, syndicate, publish, reclaim, orchestrate, collaborate, control, open, and restrict access to my bits and bytes. My journey is not yours, and your journey is not mine, but the process of sharing our stories, and having conversations around it are critical to each of us learning from each other.</p>
<p>APIs are empowering every brand you know and love (or hate) to make decisions around how they maximize where their bits and bytes are stored, accessed, and put to use across the web, mobile, and increasingly devices. Additionally APIs are empowering every brand you know and love (or hate) to also make better decisions around how they maximize where your bits and bytes are stored, accessed, and put to use across the web, mobile, and increasingly devices. Personal APIs are about shifting this balance in your favor, but for many of us, in many situations, we are fine with offloading these decisions to others, as it can be lot of work to operate on our own. &nbsp;At some point though, when they are ready, there will be a wealth of information out there to help them take back control, no matter how small that first step it might be.</p>
<p>In the end, I don't care if anyone cares about APIs, or personal APIs, but I do care about people being aware of the online services they use, and that they are equipped to make the best possible decisions they can about what services they use. For me it is less about APIs, than it is about how APIs are already being used to enable your world, and helping ensure that you have the awareness and opportunity to assert whatever amount of control over your digital self that you feel comfortable doing, whenever you are ready.</p>

<p>I always have an inbox full of requests from companies asking me to take a look at their APIs, and provide any feedback that I can. I do conduct a more formal review for some companies, but I also enjoy looking through the API operations of any API, just as part of my regular monitoring (if I have time). When I do have time, the first part of any scope of review, is to see if it meets my definition of a minimum viable API operation.</p>
<p>This is a definition I've been refining for over five years now, looking through thousands of APIs. Even with all this refinement, I still need a single place I could go, and quickly apply to any of the APIs that are in my review queue. My objective in doing these reviews is partly to help me get to know what an API does, but also provide feedback to the API providers, as well as generate stories that I can share with my readers, helping them polish their own strategy along the way.</p>
<p>To help me streamline the reviews I do, and deliver feedback to API providers, I created a little micro tool for my self, that I can use as a checklist while I go through the operations of each API in my queue. To beta test my <a href="http://minimum.viable.api.operations.definition.apievangelist.com/">minimum viable API operation definition tool</a>,&nbsp;I profiled the <a href="https://i.materialise.com/api/">3D printing API i.Materialise</a>.</p>

<p>The only areas the i.Materialise API stumbles for me is having a road map, change log, as well as a dedicated support page, with a contact person and email to reach out to. You can go to the public side of the i.Materialise site and use the contact page, which is linked in the footer of the developer portal, but I strongly recommend having a dedicated support page, and channels that are dedicated to the API community.</p>
<p>The blog, RSS, and Twitter feeds are not dedicated to the API, and are company-wide. This is fine, but at some point I recommend a dedicated blog, RSS, and Twitter accounts for the API. It can be easy to burn out API consumers with too much general information that doesn't apply to them, and there is little overhead involved with deploying a blog, RSS, and Twitter accounts dedicated to the community.</p>
<p>iMaterialise is closer to being a complete API definition, than most APIs that I look at--something that won't take much effort to bring up to speed. The area I do recommend they focus energy on is around the availability of an <a href="http://apis.how/xmynjnqxwr">OpenAPI Spec</a>, <a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>, and <a href="http://apis.how/xakqrgkfkm">Postman Collections</a> for the platform. These elements would significantly add to the available documentation for the platform, while also allowing them to <a href="https://apimatic.io/">easily generate SDKs for the platform using APIMATIC</a>, which is another deficient area for the API (no code page). In addition to better docs and SDKs, these API definitions would allow any developers to quick load up, and begin playing with the API in popular HTTP clients like <a href="http://apis.how/gwbjyujag1">Postman</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://apis.how/ebsh6b2hrd">DHC</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lack of an OpenAPI Spec is the most deficient area in my opinion. The availability of a definition, would push the presence of the iMaterialise 3D Printing API beyond the minimum viable API operation definition for me, and into the zone of a robust platform. One that will go along way towards attracting new developers, on boarding them quicker, and helping them go from discovery to successful integration -- which is what this is all about.</p>
<p>Next, if I have the time, I will create an OpenAPI Spec for the platform which will give me more awareness around the actual API design.</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Apr 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-outside-in.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>A &nbsp;huge pet peeve for me is when a company has a blog, but not provide an RSS feed--it really grinds my gears! Although it is something that aggravates me, I understand many of the reasons behind it. People just don't see their blog through an outside lens. They visit other company blogs when they want to read them, usually via a bookmark, or possibly rely on an email digest once a week--they aren't RSS reader users. RSS consumers were always a niche (that almost went mainstream), but is one that has taken a big hit with the closing of Google Reader.</p>
<p>I'm sure most of the companies would immediately turn on an RSS feed if I dropped them an email, but I'd rather write about it, and reach just the cream (my readers) on top of the API space. One of the most important side effects of being on the API journey in my opinion, is that expansion, evolution, and fine tuning of your powers for empathy that will occur along the way. Your API developer portal becomes a front line for conversations with the outside world, where you will carefully(hopefully) share your most precious internal resources, and entertain external views on how they should be exposed and put to use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my experience companies who are able to think outside the corporate firewall, do the best with APIs, with those who are open to culture change in close second--everyone else will falter. I can't help but feel that RSS is a very 101 example of this in action. I want you to read my blog, but because I didn't think beyond what I do, and my peers, when it comes to providing and consuming blogs, having an RSS feed didn't occur to me. If I was an RSS reader user, and the absence of RSS was a pain point, my tune would be different.</p>
<p>You can see this awareness in play over at <a href="https://www.workiva.com/">the&nbsp;risk, audit, finance, and compliance platform Workiva</a>. It is one of the few places I've seen <a href="http://investor.workiva.com/investors/resources/default.aspx">RSS at work in such a useful, and transparent way</a>:</p>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/workiva-rss.png" alt="" width="250" /></p>
<p>This is a level of RSS, and corporate accessibility that I only dream of. If I had an RSS feed for the press releases, event schedule, and SEC filings for every company I track on, I'd be in heaven. However with Workiva, the dream ends there--<a href="https://www.workiva.com/blog">their blog doesn't have an RSS feed</a>, or at least one that I can easily find.&nbsp;Which for me demonstrates where the average company invests in, and will develop empathy. It is usually developed around their own pain points in their operation, and within their own industry. Workiva is in the the business of monitoring corporations, and they see the value in having RSS for the signals that matter the most to them--blog, obviously not that important of a signal in this game yet.</p>
<p>I do not expect every company to cater to every need the long tail of what the public will want, nor do I expect all companies to be able to see their company through an external lens right out of the gate, but for me, the existence of RSS is one signal I tune into--similar to the signals having an API, or not having an API sends. I understand that many of my readers see RSS as a pretty insignificant thing, but for me having a blog, but not considering the wider syndication, distribution, and consumption of said blog, contributes to how I view a company's ability to think outside their firewall, and empathize with their customers, the public, and external players like me.</p>

        <span class="post-date">19 Apr 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10p;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-people.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I've heard the same thing for years--that the average person will never care about their digital stuff enough to ever want to learn about APIs, let alone for the concept of the personal API to ever be a thing. People love to comment, and tweet it at me anytime I talk about evangelizing APIs to normals, about reclaiming your domain, or <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/16/personal-api-are-not-just-a-local-destination-they-are-a-journey/">the concept of the personal API</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First off, you aren't original. IT has been telling the normals to not worry their :pretty little head" about the technical details for many, many years. It is how those with the power stay in power. If people are technically literate, and we built simple technology solutions for people, they wouldn't need us, or buy our bullshit. It is a very scary notion for many of us very insecure technologists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've worked as a professional developer since 1987, IT lead since 1998, and been evangelizing the API opportunity since 2004. These arguments are nothing new for me, but it does fascinate me that people think they are original, with very little awareness of the larger machine they operate on behalf of when they wield these statements. Like I should stop doing what I do, and having the expectations that I have, because the entire world will not fall into line -- its all or nothing. ?? WTF</p>
<p>I do not think in scale like you do. You are the slave in believing that all your ideas should scale. Not me. I'm happy if I reach one person. People like Tom Woodward (<a href="https://twitter.com/twoodwar">@twoodwar</a>), who understand that personal APIs are not about a single, perfect stack of APIs, living on a single beautiful server in your living room. Which is another rookie assault I get from fantasy believing developers looking to disarm my notion of the personal API, with their extremely simple view of what it is a "personal API".</p>
<p><a href="http://bionicteaching.com/personal-api-progress-in-pursuit-of-nirvana/">Tom is well on his way, when it comes to the API journey</a>. Tom understands that he doesn't have to be a rockstar ninja developer, or all mighty IT player to use APIs. Tom is just working to understand the footprint he leaves online each day, where all hist bits and bytes live, and how he can assert more control over this digital version of his existence. Tom will mostly likely never have a perfect stack of APIs (as technologists envision), but he is making some impressive inroads when it comes to identifying where he operates online, where he'd prefer to be operating, and how APIs can help him achieve the level of understanding and control he is seeking.</p>
<p>My mission as the API Evangelist is not about convincing everyone that APIs are a thing, and that everyone should care about APIs being available on all the platforms that we use as part of personal and professional lives. My mission is about convincing individuals, and individual business owners that they should always be asking the questions that Tom is asking, and working towards a better understanding of their digital self. Each person, business, organization, institution, or government agency I can influence to embark on their API journey, is a win for me.</p>
<p>So remember, when you tell me how nobody will every care about their digital stuff enough to want to learn about APIs, or embark on their own personal API journey, you just marked yourself as being a cog in a very old machine. You believe you are smarter than the average person, and that people are incapable of managing their own digital self, and should pay you, and the new class of technologists to do it for them. I probably shouldn't be educating y'all about this, and just let you keep self identifying for me where you stand on what role technology plays in our lives.</p>

        <span class="post-date">19 Apr 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-ownership.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was reading a post about how <a href="http://www.itbusinessedge.com/blogs/data-security/unclear-sense-of-ownership-hurts-api-security.html">having an&nbsp;unclear sense of ownership hurts API security</a>, which showcases the different views on who owns security, when it comes to exposing corporate digital assets via APIs. When I read the title, I anticipated the story being about a difference in how ownership of the asset(s) itself is viewed, but it ended up focusing on the ownership of security itself, not ownership of the assets which are being exposed -- something I think gets closer to the root of the problem, than who "owns security".&nbsp;</p>
<p>In short, the IT and developers who are often charged with exposing corporate assets via APIs will view those digital resource in some very different ways, than other people at the company. These groups will focus on exposing digital resources in a very technical sense, making them available so that others can integrate into their apps and systems--it isn't always in their nature to secure things sensibly. Their focus is to open up access, something the article touches on, but is something I think it goes deeper than just being about API security. Developers and IT are rarely ever going to see the digital resource in the same way that business stakeholders will, let alone security focused players (hopefully your IT and dev team has specialist influencing things).</p>
<p>APIs have made a name for themselves because a handful of companies successfully exposed their digital resources in this new way, allowing external perspectives of those digital resources to enter the conversation, which allowed for innovation to occur. In this handful of API origin stories we tell like to tell, owners of the digital resources at play were open to outside views of what their digital resource was, and how that resource could be put to use. These leading companies were open to an alternative view of the ownership and access of these digital resources, something that allowed API platforms to flourish &lt;&lt; This <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is not</span> something that will happen in all situations.</p>
<p>APIs really begin to go wrong, when the sense of ownership around digital resource is already unhealthy, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2016/03/21/almost-everyone-is-doing-the-api-economy-wrong/">resulting in what my friend Ed Anuff speaks of, with everyone doing the API economy wrong</a>. Without proper buy-in, developers and IT will often overlook security around resources being exposed--they just don't understand the importance of the resource in the same way. Coming from the opposite direction, business users will often come in and apply their "wet blanket" sense of ownership on the platform--resulting in heavy handed registration and approval flows, sales cycle(s), pricing, rate limits, and other common things you see slow API adoption.</p>
<p>APIs should be about us exposing our digital resources using the now ubiquitous Internet technology, in a way that opens up our resources, and the culture our business, organizations, institutions, and government agencies to outside views about what our resources are, and how they can be put to use. This is something that when done in the right environment, can reap some serious benefits for everyone involved, but when done in a culture where there is a already an imbalance around what digital resource ownership is, shit can really go wrong -- with security being just one stage where it plays out. In the end, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">APIs are not for everyone</span>. Some people just have too strict of a view around the value of their digital resources, and of the ownership of that resource, for the API thing to every actually work--with company IT and developer security practices being just a symptom of a much larger illness.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Apr 2016</span>
        <p><a href="https://gumroad.com/l/eaEq"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/api-evangelist-250-pricing-and-plan-pages.png" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I track on the API operations of around 2000 companies. Honestly, most of the 10K+ APIs in the ProgrammableWeb API directory have long been gone, deprecated, acquired, and had the lights shut off. There are only a couple thousand companies, institutions, organizations, and government who are doing public APIs, with only a couple hundred doing them in an interesting way.</p>
<p>This should not diminish the API conversation, as public APIs are just one aspect of the API discussion, and honestly it is one are that not all companies and organizations will have the stomach for. However, a certain amount of available public APIs will always play an important role in setting the tone for the entire API space, providing us with a (hopefully a diverse amount of) lead(s) when it comes to crafting our own strategies for operating our businesses on the Internet. Very little of what I do as the API Evangelist involves ideas that originate from my own head, and is something that requires a wealth of examples which I can point to in the wild.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am working on new ways to earn a living, while also generating research, analysis, code, and specification that the API sector can put to use in their own operations. One way I will be doing this, is by publishing technology, businesses, and politics of API design guides. This isn't API design as in the sense of REST, and how you craft endpoints, it is design thinking around the operations of your API. I learn a ton, flipping through the API portals of the 2000+ companies I keep an eye on, and I wanted to carve off small chunks of this, and share with you.</p>
<p>One area of API operations that has always fascinated me, and is one of the original founding focuses of API Evangelist, is how companies craft their API plans and pricing. Whether or not an API has a plans &amp; pricing page is a very telling signal all by itself, as APIs are often a side-project, without any real support and investment from its parent company or organization, and the lack of a coherent plan, with simple pricing is often a sign of other deficiencies. However when an API plan and pricing page is present, I to find it to be a very telling representation of a company, organization, institution, government agencies, and even individual(s) in some cases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I track on many data points for any single API I keep an eye on. Ranging from their Twitter account, and Blog RSS, to the activity of their Github profiles. One of the areas I link to, when present, is the plans and pricing pages. This gives me the ability to quickly check up on the pricing of APIs across various business sectors, something that drives my <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">API plans research</a>. With the help of my <a href="http://developer.kinlane.com/">organization API</a>, and my <a href="http://developer.kinlane.com/">screenshot API</a>, I was able to easily harvest, organize, and make available the plans and pricing for 250 of what I feel are some of the more relevant APIs out there today.</p>
<p>To help make my research more explorable, I organized my API plan and pricing highlights into a single PDF guide, which allows you to experience the best of my API research, without all the clicking and searching I had to do. When I record details about the plans and pricing for an API, I have a rating of 1-3 for what I call API plan coupling, which is how tightly coupled their monetization strategy is to their API. Is the pricing that is present directly applied to API consumption, or is it more for the SaaS or PaaS side of things? While not all of the plans &amp; pricing I include in this research are tightly coupled with the API, they are all from platforms where the API does play a significant role in platform operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have many of these the common building blocks employed for the <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/">API monetization strategy</a>, and for the actual <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">API plan implementations</a>, recorded in a machine readable way, as part of my research. For this guide, I wanted to step back, and look at things through more of a design lens, and less from the technical, business, or even the political side of things. I think the visual of each plan and pricing page says a lot, and doesn't need a bunch of analysis from me to fluff it up. Just flipping through, you get a sense of what looks good, what doesn't, a process that I think will hopefully push forward more consistency across the API space.</p>
<p>There are numerous lessons present in the screenshots in this guide, around which building blocks are required to support API plans and pricing. Things like breaking things up into tiers, providing contact information, mechanisms for receiving a quote, demo, and know that a trial version is available. There are also lessons in how to present large amounts of very complex information, and some lessons in not how to do it, with plenty of evidence of why simple works. Oh, and that you should have a decent graphic designer! ;-)</p>
<p>I dismiss claims from the vocal startup, and VC elite, who point out the absolutes when it comes to API monetization, and pricing. That freemium won't work, and that offering unlimited access via API is always a mistake. Every company, API, and consumer will be different. In my opinion there are a wealth of strategies available out there to learn from, which we can apply in your own strategy. There are many variables, seen and unseen, that go into whether or not an API will be "successful" or not, and I strongly reject the notion there are absolutes -- there are only agendas, usually of the behind the scenes kind.</p>
<p>I have a number of API plans and pricing pages that I did not include in the current release of this guide. I will consider evolving, and shifting it up regularly, like I try to do with my other guides. I know I learn a lot from having them in a single place, that I can easily flip through and experience the design patterns present across these 250 API platforms, and hopefully you do to. I'm currently planning an interactive micro-app version of this research, as well as the coffee table edition for the API socialite who also enjoys entertaining.</p>

<p>I was going through <a href="http://developer.ean.com">the Expedia Affiliate Network</a> again yesterday, as part of my <a href="http://travel.stack.network/">Travel Stack Network</a> work. Having individual research projects that pop up on my radar, and force to me take a fresh look at API providers is a huge part of what I do. As I was going through their portal, taking a fresh look at things, their <a href="http://developer.ean.com/approved-devs/catalog/">approved developer catalog</a>&nbsp;was something that stood out for me.</p>
<p>A list of approved developers for any API is something I get asked about fairly regularly, so I want to keep referencing examples when I come across in the wild. Each developer entry in the catalog has the following details:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Logo - </strong>A company logo, or photo of individual developer.</li>
<li><strong>Name -</strong> Name of the company or devloper.</li>
<li><strong>Title -</strong> The title of the developer that is available.</li>
<li><strong>Website -</strong> A dedicated website for the developer.</li>
<li><strong>Address - </strong>The physical or mailing address.</li>
<li><strong>Email -</strong> An individual or company email address.</li>
<li><strong>Office Phone - </strong>The office / business line for developer.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile Phone -</strong> A mobile phone for developer.</li>
<li><strong>Company Description - </strong>Details about the company.</li>
<li><strong>Developer Overview </strong>- Any additional details about developers.</li>
<li><strong>Sample(s) Of Work - </strong>Samples of work with title, description, and a link.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the big picture, I would bundle developer programs, and catalogs as just another layer of a partner program for any platform. Developer would just be an additional tier, sharing most of the same characteristics of other partner programs. I'll have to figure out how to clearly articulate the developer portion, and coherently weave into <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">my existing partner research</a>.</p>
<p>I'd like to see mature partner and developer programs operating within every API out there. I'm hoping we'll see this dimension of regular operations gain traction, alongside some of the tightening down of API programs I am seeing, and API providers work to get to know their ecosystems better. In my opinion, it will all work together to help ensure individual API community health, as well as the health of the wider API space.</p>

        <p>I sign up for a lot of APIs, and I am always surprised at what I see, or don't see, when I first signup for an API service. Personally I really enjoy the ones that have a simple, getting started formula to their signup emails. I signed up for <a href="https://developer.rosette.com/">Rosette a text analytics API</a> yesterday, and I thought their registration email was a good example of this.</p>

<p>This is all I do in the space, is explore, and experience the various APIs available today, and share my thoughts about what I see. I'm looking to organize these elements, into best practices that I can share with other companies as they work on their own strategies. Oh, I also look to apply some of these to my own operations -- I know my registration process needs some love too.</p>
<p>Eventually I will pull together the best of the signup / registration emails I get, and pull together a best practices checklist, that can be used as guide for setting up your own email format. Let me know if you need help in this area, and I'll expedite this work.</p>

<p>Over the last five years many of us have been pushing forward our API design skills to deliver valuable resources to mobile apps. The multi channel opportunity for delivering data, content, and other resources to not just websites, and web applications, but also to iPhone, Android, Windows, and other mobile platform is clear. Alongside delivering web apps to multiple browsers (IE, Chrome, and Firefox), we had to learn to deliver to an increasingly diverse mobile ecosystem (iOS, Android, Windows).</p>
<p>When you have an API core, crafting new endpoints that speak to new channels is not as daunting of a task. I'm thinking through how to deliver API Evangelist knowledge into a Slack channel, Facebook Messenger discussions, and via Alex Voice for use at our <a href="http://boston2016.apistrat.com/">APIStrat Conference in Boston this fall</a>. Whether I am creating bots, or delivering new skills to voice enablement, I'm just adding new design constraints to my already existing stack of things I consider when I'm crafting my API stack(s).</p>
<p>I can't help but be in tune with the frenzy around bots, and the interesting things AWS is doing within the Alexa ecosystem. I do not feel like it is a distraction from my core business, as I'm just applying some new design constraints to what I am already doing. I'm not chasing entirely new things, I'm just responding, and participating in what the latest shifts in what technology are.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com">I don't feel like any of the 50 areas of the API space that I'm keeping an eye on are distractions</a>, as long as I stay true to my API core, and they help me critically think through, and apply new design constraints to the core business value I am already bringing to the table.</p>

<p><a href="http://low-hanging-fruit.github.io/davidson-college/">I am working to identify the low hanging fruit for deploying APIs at Davidson College</a>. It is a process where I target the domain, at the request of someone on campus, then slowly spider the website over a couple week period, and identify CSV, XML, XLS, and JSON files, as well as any tables with over five rows--now I"m also tracking on the presence of any HTML form.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/04/12/developing-api-tooling-for-the-average-business-user-over-at-formio/">At the same time I'm talking with Form.io about some of their case studies and client implementations, working to better understand how their form-centric API solution is making an impact with small business owners</a>. Form.io lets anyone built forms, which then does all the heavy lifting of deploying an API that drives each of the form implemented. I am finding it very valuable to hear about the inroads they are making with businesses, as an API solution, because they speak using "forms"--a language that the average business user often understands.</p>
<p>When it comes to APIs, not everyone has a ready to go implementation in mind for how an API can be used to publish data and content to a website or mobile app, but a greater number of people will understand the need to fill out a form, and have it publish to a central place. I am feeling like this opens up an opportunity to educate the normals about APIs, when it is done in the service of form submissions, eliminating PDF, or even the printed form.</p>
<p><a href="http://low.hanging.fruit.apievangelist.com/">I am adding forms to my list of how I identify low hanging fruit for APIs</a>. I will be tracking on the forms that companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies have on their site, and using as one potential opportunity for some API literacy. I'll also think about other ways that I can use the concept of a form, to help normals understand the possibilities with APIs -- I just wanted to kick off this exploration, as I see forms overlap in my world in my low hanging fruit work at Davidson, and conversations with Form.io.</p>

<p>I spend my days mapping out the API life cycle, <a href="http://apievangelist.com">keeping track of what I consider to be the 50+ areas of a modern API life cycle</a>, based upon the approach I am seeing from leading providers. One area of this life cycle I'm spending way more time than I want to be lately, is in the area of <a href="http://deprecation.apievangelist.com/">API deprecation</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is why I conduct my API research in the way that I do, because when people approach me for advice, guidance, or brain dump in any of these areas, I have a wealth of resources I can pull from. Sadly I have a couple of folks ask me for input on what I'd consider to be a good approach to individual API deprecation, as well as entire company, platform, and API deprecation.</p>
<p>Sadly, there very few "good approaches" to shutting down your APIs in the wild. Luckily there are quite a number of very bad approaches available, that we can reverse engineer, and begin putting together a scaffolding for what might be some possible best practices, when it comes to API deprecation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went through <a href="http://deprecation.apievangelist.com/news/">what I had curated as part of my API deprecation research</a>, and assembled these common building blocks:</p>
<p><strong>Types</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Individual API Endpoints -</strong> Looking to have a plan for the deprecation of individual APIs, or sets of APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Individual API Tooling -</strong> An approach to how you deprecate one of the client solutions available on API platform.</li>
<li><strong>Entire Platform Shutdown - </strong>What is the plan for an entire platform shutdown, ceasing all API operations.</li>
<li><strong>Enter Platform Safe Mode -</strong> What is the plan for just putting the platform into safe mode, and still operating.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Runway</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Initial Expectation Set -</strong> What expectations are, or have been set early on in the API design, and deployment parts of the life cycle when it comes to API deprecation.</li>
<li><strong>Legal Department -</strong> What legally has been provided in terms of service, privacy policy, and other parts of the legal department for a platform.</li>
<li><strong>First Decision -</strong> Establishing that an API or platform will need to be deprecated. Recording the date, time, and other key details on what this decision was reached.</li>
<li><strong>First Notice - </strong>What is the time to the first external notice, either privately to partners, or also publicly to the general community.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Lock-down New Signups -</strong> When will new signups for the platform be locked down, stopping all new user and application registration.</li>
<li><strong>Lock-down New Writes - </strong>When will all POST, PUT, and other write capabilities be locked down, making it easier to stabilize, sync, and migrate for final shut down.</li>
<li><strong>Light Switch Flicking -</strong> Will there be light switch flicking, or dark-out testing, which send real world pain to API consumers, reminding them that a shutdown is imminent.</li>
<li><strong>Other Milestones - </strong>What other milestones are there that will be important to internal, partner, and public stakeholders?&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Final Date -</strong> What is the final date for shutdown, requiring all syncs, migrations, exports, and integration to completely cease.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Communication</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key Players - </strong>As soon as the first decision to deprecate is made, who are the key players, and stake holder that need to be contacted, and made aware of the API deprecation.</li>
<li><strong>Public Players -</strong> Once key stakeholders are made aware, what is the plan to go public, and make the general community, and industry aware that the API deprecation is imminent.</li>
<li><strong>Schedule (Runway) -</strong> What does the entire runway look like, with as complete schedule from first decision, to final date -- including a communication schedule documented along the way.</li>
<li><strong>Historical - </strong>What historical communications will be made available from blog posts, to tweets, documentation, and other communication focused efforts.</li>
<li><strong>Be Real -</strong> Make sure that you are genuine in your plans, communication, and out reach.</li>
<li><strong>Be Friendly - </strong>Be as friendly as you can. It will be a hard time for everyone involved.</li>
<li><strong>Be Transparent -</strong> Try to be as transparent as you possibly can, throughout the process.</li>
<li><strong>Be Respectful -</strong> Showing respect for your consumers, and their challenges will go a long way.</li>
<li><strong>PR Campaign -</strong> Craft a public relations plan, and execute it well. Don't take shortcuts.</li>
<li><strong>Communicate Often -</strong> Make sure and email, post to blog, tweet, and communicate regulatly about the deprecation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tooling</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Migration -</strong> What data migration tools, services, and support will be made available to help customers get their data off of a platform, and somewhere where they can put to use.</li>
<li><strong>Settings Migration -</strong> Will there be the opportunity to export settings, and other configurations, so that they can be applied into other external systems, either automatically, or manually.</li>
<li><strong>Data Sync -</strong> Are there any real-time data sync opportunities, to help reduce the amount of work that is needed at the time of shutdown, slowly getting API consumers offloaded to their new solution.</li>
<li><strong>Data Portability -</strong> Beyond migration, and syncing, can API consumers get raw dumps of all of their usage data, as well as any other object, and entity they have stored via API operations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Licensing</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data License - </strong>How will data be licensed after things are shut down?</li>
<li><strong>Server Code - </strong>What server code will be made available as open source license?</li>
<li><strong>Client Code -</strong> What client code will be made available as open source license?</li>
<li><strong>API License - </strong>How will the API definition, and data schema be licensed for reuse?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Virtualization</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AWS AMI -</strong> Will there be an Amazaon AMI made available for any server or client implementations?</li>
<li><strong>Heroku Deploy&nbsp;-</strong> Will there be Heroku deployment made available for any server or client implementations?</li>
<li><strong>Docker Image&nbsp;- </strong>Will there be Docker images made available for any server or client implementations?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Management</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Github Repo - </strong>Will a dedicated Github repository be made available for the company, platform, API, or other aspects of opportunity, made available for capturing any remaining code, data, and content.</li>
<li><strong>Github Issues - </strong>Is there a Github issues established for handling all concerns, and conversations around the API deprecation.</li>
<li><strong>API Purgatory -</strong> Have you contacted Kin Lane, the API Evangelist, so he can take a snapshot of your API, for inclusion in the API Purgatory Museum.</li>
<li><strong>X-API-Warn -</strong> Using the X-API-Warn header for all requests made to any deprecated APIs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Support</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Contact Person - </strong>Who is the person (name, email, Twitter, and Github) who is the point of contact for the API deprecation process.</li>
<li><strong>Migration Partners - </strong>Are there any migration partners that can help out during any migrations, syncing, configuration, and setup of external solutions.</li>
<li><strong>Migration Locations -</strong> Are there any other existing platforms, including competitors, that you can point API consumers to, as an alternative to the API being deprecated.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Like the areas of my API life cycle, these API deprecation building blocks are by no means complete. I'm just extracting some of the comment elements that I see when I look through just the little bit of API deprecation history that I've managed to curate. The trick now, is to find more time so that I can dig deeper, and find the API deprecation stories I do not have indexed, and hopefully establish a timeline of sorts, along with some of the other possible building blocks that might help folks craft their own deprecation strategy.</p>
<p>I'd love to hear your thoughts on what you think should be considered as part of the inevitable API deprecation process. I thought my friend Mark Boyd (<a href="https://twitter.com/mgboydcom">@mgboydcom</a>) did a good job <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/news/2015-api-deprecation-and-versioning-now-more-strategic-issue/analysis/2016/01/04">capturing the reality of API deprecation from a provider view</a>, as well as <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/news/how-to-manage-risk-losing-api-access/analysis/2016/01/19">what things look like from the API consumer vantage point</a>, if you need a good narrative of what I'm trying to achieve.</p>
<p>Ultimately I think this is a conversation we need to be having more often, with more API providers, out in the open. I'd like to see more platforms publish what their API deprecation strategy is, either as a blog post, or in a more formal way. I'll spend more time next week, digger deeper in the past to find some of the more high profile API deprecation that I'm missing in my research, gather feedback from folks I'm talking to about their API deprecation strategies, and hopefully evolve this list of common API deprecation building blocks forward more.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Apr 2016</span>
        <p><a href="http://low.hanging.fruit.apievangelist.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-grapes.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I get approached by folks all the time who are looking to do APIs at their company, organization, institution, or government agency. The reasons behind these desires to do APIs vary widely. Some want to do API to deliver a specific web or mobile app, while many others just understand they need to get started somewhere, but are unsure of exactly where to begin with this daunting, never-ending task.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In these situations I always tell people to start with the low hanging fruit, which means, if its already on your website, it should also be available as an API. If you are publishing data or content to your website, as HTML, CSV, XML, XLS, or JSON, you should have available via an API. The average company has a mess of information made available via a website, and the API journey is about untangling this mess, and make it available for not just the web, but also mobile, messaging, bot, voice, and other emerging channels in which people are getting their information.</p>
<p>I've been asked to help identify the low hanging fruit for enough groups now, <a href="http://low.hanging.fruit.apievangelist.com/">I'm looking to formalize it as a service</a>. My low hanging fruit process involves spinning up a web spider instance on AWS, giving it a domain as a target, and letting it slowly spider all the HTML pages, looking for the following low hanging fruit, over the course of a couple of weeks.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tables</strong> - Identify an HTML page with a table on it that has more than 5 rows.</li>
<li><strong>CSV</strong> - Identify an CSV file that is linked to from any HTML page within the domain.</li>
<li><strong>XLS</strong> -&nbsp;Identify an XLS or XSLX file that is linked to from any HTML page within the domain.</li>
<li><strong>XML</strong> -&nbsp;Identify an XML file that is linked to from any HTML page within the domain.</li>
<li><strong>Forms</strong> - Identify any page that has a form on it, and also index any fields available with it.</li>
</ul>
<p>After I've spun up the spider server instance, and let it run for a few days, I can output a JSON list of any tables, CSV, XLS, XML, and forms that the spider has found. I publish each of these as JSON files, which can then be reviewed for possible API candidates. Ideally each entry gets fleshed out more, giving it a human readable title, a description, apply some tags, and hopefully identifying the source of the data, and hopefully better understand some of the goals around why it is published.</p>
<p>Once the low hanging fruit bot is released, I follow up with a manual review of the website being targeted, looking for common entities and objects that emerge from the top level, and sub navigation -- reverse engineering the sites information architecture, so it can also be considered alongside the other low hanging fruit that is defined. I would say this process helps identify many of the top level organizational and business motivations for sharing information, where the spidering, and targeting of low hanging fruit represents the under-currents, or less obvious organizational and business motivations behind making information available.</p>
<p>That is my low hanging fruit approach. It is a pretty crude, yet can be a very valuable way to helping jumpstart API efforts at any company, organization, institution, and government agency. If a formal approach has not already emerged out of existing IT, and developer groups within your organization, you might consider a more grass roots, low hanging fruit approach to identifying the next steps for your API effort(s).</p>
<p>With this low hanging fruit target list, and website review in hand, we can start to talk about what is needed next when it comes to designing, defining, deploying, and managing APIs. If you need help with this, let me know, I'm now doing it as a service for more companies and organiations--<a href="http://apievangelist.com/contact/">just contact me via one of my channels, and I'll see what I can do</a>.</p>
<p>P.S. Please make sure you have the legal right to spider the website in this way. I'm only looking to consider the low hanging fruit of your own organization, ad better understand how to jumpstart an official API effort -- we are just doing this from the outside-in.</p>

<p>While I am on the subject of API deprecation, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/04/12/api-deprecation-art/">showcasing some of the interesting ways folks deprecate their APIs</a>, I want to actually send out a message to API operators, that if you are considering, preparing (or not preparing) to deprecate your API, I wanted to talk with you including it in the API Purgatory Museum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was joking about missing Google Wave today, as I read about the army of bots, and bot platforms today, which resulted in Stefano Buliani jokingly asking about my API purgatory list.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane">@kinlane</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/dberkholz">@dberkholz</a> think there should be an API purgatory, do you have the list?</p>

<script src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
<p>Which is something that actually isn't a bad idea. When an API goes away, I would like to have the chance to take a snapshot of what was. I'm not insane enough to think that I can take every API and stand it up, host it, and continue to operate it. However there would be a handful that I would actually be willing to do that, and for the rest I would at least like to create an OpenAPI Spec, and JSON Schema snapshot of the API. Along with some screenshots of the API portal, docs, and other common elements. Who knows maybe I can get a working mock of it up and running for the museum.</p>
<p>Even though Stefano Buliani and I were joking. I'm actually putting out there for real, so if you are planning on deprecating your API and would like to donate the server code to the API Purgatory Museum, or have me take a snapshot of it, drop me a line. I can't guarantee I'll be interested, but if you are interested in your API living on, beyond what you are able to do -- ping me. I'm happy to keep private, so we do not disrupt the order of the universe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I might even work out some sort of credit system that could be applied toward forgiving you for your API sins? ;-) A trade that allows you to go on with your life, while your API lives in a virtualized hell, paying for all of our collective API sins, for eternity.</p>

<p>When I am review API services and tooling, the majority of what I see is targeting the API elite, the most technical, and specialized of us in the API space. Rarely do I come across approaches that really speak to the average business person, but each time I talk to the <a href="https://form.io/">Form.io team</a> I am reminded that these tools can, and do exist in the wild.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I get regularly walk through from the team, so what they do is no surprise, but each time I see it in action, I'm moved by what is possible, and the inroads they are building into everyday businesses. Using Form.io you can build forms, but these aren't forms, they are apps, and they are APIs, as well as being a form. When you are building a form, you are building an API, and when you hit publish, it publishes the API, with the form as the first web or mobile app that is consuming the API.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://form.io/">Form.io</a> gives you the capability to publish one or many of these apps (forms), and manage the data that is pushed out, pulled in, and aggregated from across your network of apps. Form.io does all the heavy lifting for you, while still speaking the common language of the form -- which almost everyone in the business world understands. I walked though a couple of Form.io most recent case studies (which I'll talk about in future posts), but I wanted to take a moment to highlight that Form.io has made an API design, deployment, and management tool--except you don't realize that is what you are doing, as an end user, you are just building a form that matches meets your business need.</p>

        <span class="post-date">12 Apr 2016</span>
        <p>I'm in the middle of a sprint, where I am going through 50 of my main API stacks, to see what has changed, and who is still home. I'm always fascinated by the number of APIs that just fade away into a 301 redirect to a domains home page. Some projects get gobbled up by domain squatters, where others almost rise to the level of API deprecation art.</p>

<p>I might get this one framed. I thought the background, combined with the message was a great representation of the current state of API affairs. Its getting harder and harder to operate an API, keep it up and going, and live up to the hype and expectations.</p>
<p>I am going to start saving more snapshots of what happens when an API goes away--who knows maybe some day I'll have an interesting collection.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="http://stack.apievangelist.com/companies.html">I was going through the list of APIs that I depend on</a>, auditing the services that I'm paying for, and trimming the budget where I can, a process that involves spending time on the pricing and plan pages for the APIs I pay for--understanding pricing. <a href="http://developer.kinlane.com/apis.json">I have all of my internal APIs defined as an APIs.json collection</a>, as <a href="http://stack.apievangelist.com/apis.json">well as the 3rd party APIs which I depend on</a>. This allows me to easily navigate all the moving parts of these APIs, and quickly get at what I need during times like this.</p>
<p>As I was browsing the pricing pages, and evaluating the replacement of a couple of these systems I wanted to better understanding the terms of service, and licensing for these APIs I am employing. I try to keep the legal department for all of the API I use indexed with APIs.json as well, something that allows me to then navigate to the legal side of these platforms. My APIs.json index for this IT collection, gives me easy access to the legal side of my API integrations.</p>

<p>While these building blocks are not machine readable like the OpenAPI Spec, Postman, and other items I have indexed with APIs.json, they do provide me with a single place to go and find the pricing, TOS, privacy policies, trademark, branding, security, and support for the APIs I depend on to run my businesses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use OpenAPI Specs to help guide my integration from the generation of client code, and then load into my Postman or other web API client. I'm also increasingly used other secondary machine readable elements like Twitter users, Github users, and Blog RSS to stay in tune with the heartbeat of these APIs. The Twitter and Github APIs allow me to pull details about these companies operations in real time, something I'm hoping I can do with pricing, security, TOS, and privacy updates some day. #hopeful</p>
<p>Wearing my old IT director hat (which my therapists says I'm not supposed to), it just makes sense to have an up to date, machine readable <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json index of the APIs I depend on</a>. In my opinion, we should have real time monitoring data from my <a href="http://apiscience.com">API Science</a> account, and performance data from my <a href="http://apimetrics.io">APIMetrics account</a>, and accurate data on plans and pricing for services, and what I am spending. Currently, only a handful these providers give me analytics, and API usage data, let alone other vital details on spend, errors, security, and other critical aspects of my integration--if I do get it, I have to go get it manually, a small group have APIs for these data points.</p>
<p>Do you have a single dashboard, list, or napkin with the critical business and legal aspects of API integrations? Or are you just leaving the management of these details to your IT and developers?&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Apr 2016</span>
        <p>I see a lot of APIs in my daily work. The diverse number of ways in which APIs are being used is one of the things that keeps my ADD brain interested in all things APIs. While the technical, business, and politics of the API game infinitely has ways to keep me paying attention, I find myself engaged more lately, not just for the belief in the potential of APIs for good, but around the potential for misuse--at a troubling pace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Increasingly I am stumbling across API implementations, that when I am initially learning about, the 12 year old boy in me is immediately interested, but then the 43 year old skeptical in me recoils, like I am seeing a car accident on the highway.&nbsp;<a href="https://insitu.com/information-delivery/video-exploitation/tungsten">Insitu's Tungsten Software Development Kit has this effect on me</a> -- Insitu makes technology for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV).</p>
<p><a href="https://insitu.com/blog/2016/02/16/a-true-find-capability-for-uas"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/insitu-drones.png" alt="" width="75%" /></a></p>
<p>I think the tagline on their home page sums itup well--the API opportunity is at this layer of civil, commercial, and defense deployment of UAVs.</p>
<p><a href="https://insitu.com/blog/2016/02/16/a-true-find-capability-for-uas"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/Insitu-1.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>I think their own description of the&nbsp;Tungsten Software Development Kit, speaks well to what APIs can do for almost any device, including UAVs:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Our Tungsten Media Toolkit offers the ideal software development kit (SDK) for companies and platforms that demand flexible, superior, real-time digital media solutions. Designed by software developers, Tungsten can be used for a wide array of media purposes and applications and offers developers an extensive application programming interface (API) to operate on media from a variety of sources, be it cameras, network streams, archives, and beyond. Insitu Mission Systems addresses your metadata-rich media challenges by applying the Tungsten toolkit and deep expertise in tactical data collection and processing.</em></p>
<p>With the awareness I've seen realized from using APIs in between the back-end, and front-end web and mobile applications, I can only imagine what is possible, when you open up API access to a drone, its camera, and all its information gathering capability.&nbsp;It is exciting to think about from a technical perspective, that is when I have my technological blinders on -- which is default mode for me, as a white male software architect living in the US.</p>
<p>However, when I take these blinders off, and think about the potential for abuse in all three areas listed above, I can't help but worry for our future. APIs are a win for these platforms, and their partner developers, but when it comes to transparency and accountability at this layer I've seen very little action. Which is part of the reason I am writing about it. I'm all for APIs being a thing in UAV, but part of my motivation isn't about the drone opportunity, its the opportunity for transparency and accountability to be baked into this layer by default, so that we help minimize the number of negative outcomes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While UAV usage worries me, I think the cat is out of the bag, and there is no stopping this type of technology from being a thing. We just have to get better and ensuring the mechanisms are in place to ensure platform providers, and their developers are doing the right thing. The opportunities for misuse is extremely high, but I am hoping that it will be something that can be reduced with an open API approach. #NotHoldingBreathe</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Apr 2016</span>
        <p><a href="http://adopta-agency.github.io/open-referral-api/">I just published the OpenAPI Spec I just created for the Human Services Data Specification (HSDS) into one of my default portals</a>, which once the OpenAPI Spec is indexed via the portals API.json, I get a ready to go landing page, documentation, and other tooling for supporting the API. I have been pushing forward my API documentation, beyond the (now) standard issue Swagger UI, keeping the OpenAPI Spec core, but evolving the UI portion using Jekyll and Liquid.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://adopta-agency.github.io/open-referral-api/documentation/">I have a default API docs implementation, which loops through all OpenAPI Spec included within a project, and renders HTML documentation for each path, verb, etc.</a> I'm still working on how I recreate the dynamic functionality brought to the table by Swagger UI, but so far I'm really, really enjoying the flexiblity with the user interface, and overall experience I get using this approach--I know the interactive portion will come.</p>
<p>One of the things I'm enjoying being able to do, is apply additional, external elements to the OpenAPI Spec, by augmenting them with independent, APIs.json defined schema. <a href="http://adopta-agency.github.io/open-referral-api/apis.json">One example of this I am calling API filters, a simple filter collection defined in both YAML and JSON, that is indexed along with the OpenAPI Spec, within the APIs.json index</a>. For the Open Referral API I wanted to provide the complete documentation, but also play around with other different, filtered views of the API -- designed for specific audiences.</p>
<p>The first entry I made into API filters, I called "learn the basics", only showing the core resources that were available via the Open Referral API, eliminating all of the noise.</p>

<p>This API docs view, gives me just the handful of core endpoints, filtering out the other 60+ APIs that someone who is just learning about the Open Referral API do not need to be bothered with when they are learning. Next, I wanted to focus in on a specific area of the API, like services, and only show the summary elements, that most people will care about when it comes to these services. I'm calling this one "services summary":</p>

<p>The Liquid driven HTML API docs are the same for the <a href="https://github.com/adopta-agency/open-referral-api/edit/gh-pages/documentation/index.html">full documentation</a>, for <a href="https://github.com/adopta-agency/open-referral-api/blob/gh-pages/documentation/services-summary/index.html">learn the basics</a>, or for the <a href="https://github.com/adopta-agency/open-referral-api/blob/gh-pages/documentation/learn-the-basics/index.html">services summary</a>. All three documentation elements are also all <a href="http://adopta-agency.github.io/open-referral-api/api-commons/openapi-spec.json">driven from the same OpenAPI Spec</a>. The only thing I did, was specify one of the API Filters by name, in the top of each specialized docs page -- the Liquid template handles the rest. Its still pretty crude, and I'm sure it will need a lot of polishing, but it provides me with a simple, machine readable way to filter out the endpoints I do not need, accomplishing what I set out to do.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/f073d9a8d1bec151b16a9c8e7f8cd335.js"></script>
<p>I am using schema approaches like this more lately. An approach that when indexed along with the OpenAPI Spec, in an API.json file gives me other layers, and dimension that I can apply for not just documentation, but almost any other stop along the life cycle. To me, and important part of this is that these elements do not live embedded within the OpenAPI Spec, living independent of the the machine readable definition of the API. Each one lives its own schema file, and when indexed alongside each API definition, within the APIs.json, interesting things happen--all without cluttering up the OpenAPI Spec, keeping it purely about the API.</p>
<p>My goal in this work, is to provide me with a way that I can equip the other less technical advocates for the Open Referral format, with a toolbox of documentation, visualizations, and other snippets that will help them articulate what the API can do. Since all of these API documentation snippets are APIs.json, and OpenAPI Spec driven, using Liquid, and Jekyll to render, they are something that anyone could put to use, for any API.</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Apr 2016</span>
        <p>As I was preparing for my talk with Dan from Open Referral, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/31/gathering-my-thoughts-about-open-referral-and-the-human-services-api/">I published some of my thoughts on the organization, and the Human Services Data Specification (HSDS)</a>. One of the things I did as part of that work was generating of a first draft of an OpenAPI Spec for the Open Referral API. To create that draft, I used the existing Ohana API as the base, exposing the same endpoints as they did in the Code For America project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the last couple days, I spent some more time getting to know the data model set forth by HSDS, and got to work evolving my draft OpenAPI Spec to be closer in alignment with the data schema. To do this I took the JSON Schema for HSDS that was available on the Github, and generated used it as a framework to add any missing elements to the API definition, resulting in almost 70 API paths, in support of almost 20 separate entities dictated in the HSDS.</p>

<p>This is a very formulaic, generated, representation of what the Open Referral API could look like. While I have lots of ideas on how to improve on the design, I want to be cautious to not project too much of my own views on the API design--something the community should do together. I can tell a lot of work went into the current specification, and the same amount of energy should go into evolving the API design.</p>
<p>I accomplished what I wanted. Learn more about HSDS, get more familiar with the entities at play, while also producing a fairly robust representation of what an API could look like for Open Referral. It has way more details than the average implementation will need, but I wanted to cover all the bases, providing full control over every entity, and relationship represented in HSDS. Most importantly I was able to get more intimate with the specification, while also producing an OpenAPI Spec that will playing a central role throughout this project.</p>
<p>Next I'm going to play with some minimum viable representations, and other ways to tell stories and talk about the HSDS. I'd like to eventually have a whole toolbox of YAML / JSON driven UI elements, like the one I pasted in this post, allowing me to describe all the moving parts of the Open Referral work. More posts to come, as I work through my thoughts, and play possible designs for the Human Services Data Specification (HSDS).<!--?p--></p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Apr 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 5px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/freemium.jpg" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I had another conversation with an API service provider today about their freemium accounts not converting. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/22/i-am-hearing-a-lot-more-talk-about-restricting-free-and-freemium-tiers-of-api-access/">I've been sharing my thoughts about these freemium service account conversations</a>, as I work to understand a shift that is occurring, and what my own feelings are. At this point, I feel like we (providers and consumers) are all responsible for freemium not working, than it is about the concept itself not working.</p>
<p>Some of the poor behaviors of service providers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No Business Models </strong>- Everything being free, and not having a coherent business model.</li>
<li><strong>No Ascension Possible </strong>- There is free account, maybe one more paid level, then unobtainable beyond.</li>
<li><strong>Credit Card Trap -</strong> Requiring credit card on demos, trials, without easy way to not be billed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the poor behaviors of service consumers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No Communication - </strong>Never actually engaging in a conversation with platform providers.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple Accounts -</strong> Using multiple accounts to get around limitations of individual accounts.</li>
<li><strong>Drop Service -</strong> Only use the service to get what you need, then migrating off of service.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>I feel that the concept of freemium model, when its bundled with a coherent monetization strategy, can work. However, I feel like service providers will ultimately have to tighten down their controls, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/30/best-buy-will-not-issue-api-keys-to-free-email-accounts-and-wants-to-get-to-know-your-company/">do like Best Buy has done</a>, requiring that developers get to know them before you get any meaningful API access. #MakesSenseToMe</p>
<p>Sadly, when the bad behavior by developers, and API consumers, is coupled with a push by investors to focus&nbsp; on selling to the enterprise, we are going to see free and freemium tiers go away. We'll see plenty of quality services emerge, but unless you have enterprise resources behind you, you won't be getting access to them. Which in my opinion will further shift the way software is developed and consumed, back toward the old way we did before SaaS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm guessing many of you business folks will just file this under markets working things out. However I think it is more about those with resources actually maintaining the upper hand. It bums me out that 1000lb gorillas can offer free services to lower the bar so low, nobody can survive. These aren't healthy market behaviors or forces, it is just bad for everyone without the resources to survive in these environments.</p>
<p>Another realization I've had about all of this, is that a whole generation of developers have grown up in this environment. I talked to a "senior engineer" yesterday, who told me about his long career, that started in 2007. Leaving me realizing that many developers think free software is normal, and 99c apps is a good thing. Buying into the unrealistic, market disrupting, and dominating behavior of the Googles out there.</p>
<p>Honestly I don't give a shit anymore. I won't be writing about any solutions that my small business can't afford, and kick the tires before swiping my business credit card. Who am I though? Nobody. As a real small business, I will always spend the time to get to know my service providers, and well as my service consumers, and I will be able to find money in the cracks -- as I have since 1988. #onward</p>

<p>I am spending time evaluating the evolution of the three applications offered by <a href="https://restlet.com">Restlet</a>, as they work to bring the experience across <a href="https://restlet.com/products/apispark/">API Spark</a>, <a href="https://restlet.com/products/restlet-studio/">Restlet Studio</a>, and <a href="https://restlet.com/products/dhc/">DHC</a>, into closer alignment. To describe what Restlet does in my API terminology, API Spark is an API deployment solution, Restlet Studio is an API design solution, and DHC is an API client solution. These are extreme simplifications, but helps me keep the fast moving API space somewhat organized (for me), and helps me share stories that (hopefully) make sense (for you).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every couple of weeks I spend an hour or two talking with Jerome Louvel (<a href="https://twitter.com/jlouvel">@jlouvel</a>), the founder of Restlet, about their road map, and where the wider API space is going. Similar to my own work, <a href="http://apievangelist.com">trying to map out the API life cycle</a>, Restlet is trying evolve their own suite of API solutions, into more of a life cycle management solution. Restlet touches all of the core areas of the life cycle, including design, definitions, deployment, management, and client, while also making moves into testing, and beyond. I told Jerome I would spend more time thinking about this journey that they are on, and provide any thoughts I can.</p>
<p>While I was playing with DHC, making some calls to my blog API, I kept being pulled down to the bottom tab, below my API response information, where there are tabs for history, assertions, HTTP, and docs. While the API request and response is very technical, at the bottom of the DHC client, I see elements of the business and politics of APIs.</p>
<p><a href="https://restlet.com/products/dhc/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/API_Evangelist_Blog_-_DHC_by_Restlet.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>For me, the features Restlet has exposed as tabs in the DHC footer, resemble how APIs are acting as business contracts. The docs represents the contract language, the HTTP tab is the details of the exchange, assertions are what is expected of the contract, and history is the recording of the contracted exchange (or lack of). What keep pulling my eyes to the bottom of the screen in DHC was the concept of assertions, which the dictionary says is:</p>
<ol>
<li>the act of stating clearly and strongly or making others aware</li>
<li>something stated as if certain</li>
</ol>
<p>What assertions are being made of any API? Assertions span the three tiers of API operations for me, crossing the technical, business, and politics. In theory assertions shouldn't just be API developer-centric, they should also reflect the needs of API consumers, business, and end-users as well. As I'm playing with assertions in DHC, I'm thinking how can we open up these definitions to business groups? How do we collaborate and share assertions across our API teams? Or possibly with an entire API community or industry?</p>
<p>While assertions are applied at the specific API level in DHC, I can't help but see the need for a library of company-wide assertions, some unique to specific APIs, with others existing more universally and applied across many APIs. This leaves me thinking that assertions need to stand on their own, independent of any single API, be portable and shareable, and always be written in as plain English as possible--something that can be agreed upon across all stakeholders involved with an APIs contract.</p>
<p>I feel like assertions will be a growing dimension of APIs, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/23/exposing-the-meaningful-skills-our-apis-possess-for-use-in-the-next-gen-messaging-and-voice-apps/">similar to APIs needing to have the "skills" required for simple, meaningful implementations in bot, and voice enable applications</a>, assertions are just the contract level promise of what an API can do, will do, and then actually is proven to do reliably. Anyways, just thinking through my ideas, in preparation for my next conversation with Jerome. Having partners that I can brainstorm with like this helps me work through my ideas, and hopefully they can cherry pick some useful items from my ramblings for their road map.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Apr 2016</span>
        <p>It always makes me smile, when I talk to someone about one or many areas of my API research, sharing how I conduct my work, and they are surprised to find how many areas I track on. <a href="http://apievangelist.com">My home page has always been a doorway to my research</a>, and I try to keep this front door as open as possible, providing easy access to my more mature areas like API management, all the way to my newer areas like how bots are using APIs.</p>
<p>From time to time, I like to publish my API life cycle research to an individual blog post, which I guess puts my home page, the doorway to my research into my readers Twitter stream, and feed reader. Here is a list of my current research for April 2016, from design to deprecation.</p>

<p>I am constantly working to improve my research, organizing more of the organizations who are doing interesting things, the tooling that is being deployed, and relevant news from across the area. I use all this research, to fuel my analysis, and drive my lists of common building blocks, which I include in my guides, blueprints, and other white papers and tutorials that I produce.</p>
<p>I am currently reworking all the PDF guides for each research area, updating the content, as well as the layout to use my newer minimalist guide format. As each one comes off the assembly line, I will add to its respective research area, and publish an icon + link on the home page of API Evangelist--so check back regularly. If there is any specific area you'd like to see get more attention, always let me know, and I'll see what I can do.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2016/04/08/example-of-api-service-providers-making-onboarding-with-services-easier-using-api-definitions/">Example Of API Service Providers Making Onboarding With Services Easier Using API Definitions</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">08 Apr 2016</span>
        <p><a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/building-blocks/">API definitions like OpenAPI Spec, API Blueprint, and Postman</a>, have been gaining in popularity over the last couple of years, mostly because of the their ability to deploy interactive documentation like Swagger UI. However, the API providers who have been using them the longest, have also realized these machine readable definitions can be applied effectively at almost every step along <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/04/08/my-api-life-cycle-research-from-design-to-deprecation/">a modern API life cycle, from design to deprecation</a>.</p>
<p>I'm always encouraging companies, who are selling software services to the API space (aka API service providers), to make sure and have APIs for their entire stack, as well as speak in as many of the leading API definition formats as you possibly can. To help in this effort, I try to regularly showcase the API service providers who are doing it right--this round, its the folks over at <span><a href="http://apimetrics.io">APImetrics</a></span>.</p>
<p>The screen that comes up, when you go to add new API calls to the monitoring service is exactly what I am talking about, allowing me to get up and running using the API definition format of my choosing.</p>
<p><a href="http://apimetrics.io"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/Fullscreen_4_8_16__1_09_PM.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>I am given the option to manually add an API, or do a bulk import of the APIs I wish to monitor using the service. I'm given the option of importing WSDL, OpenAPI Spec, RAML, Blueprint, and Postman, which reflects the leading API definition formats, any API service provider should be speaking by default. If you need help enabling this in your services, I recommend talking to the <a href="https://apimatic.io/">APIMATIC</a> folks about using their <a href="https://apitransformer.com/">API Transformer</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">API definitions</a> are quickly becoming the central contract that gets passed around among technical folks, and increasingly with business units as well. No matter where you exist on the API life cycle, between API design, all the way to deprecation, your customers should be able to onboard, and offboard using all of the modern API definition formats--enabling your users get up and running in seconds, rather than minutes, hours, or even not at all.&nbsp;</p>
