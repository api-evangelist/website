<p>I started <a title="actively looking for evangelists, advocates and ambassadors in multiple cities last week" href="/2012/11/03/evangelists-needed-in-new-york-chicago-boston-seattle-denver-austin-and-portland/">actively looking for evangelists, advocates and ambassadors in multiple cities last week</a>.&nbsp;I got a great response from quite a few folks who were already evangelizing in their communities or just curious about evangelism.</p>
<p>Even with the response <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I&rsquo;m still looking for evangelists in Portland, OR, Seattle, WA and Austin, TX</span>.</p>
<p>If you're interested in attending tech meetups and hackathons in your town and evangelizing some innovative API and developer platforms, I want to talk more.</p>
<p>I was surprised to get numerous folks contacting me in other cities around the world, saying they were open evangelism in their area.  Even though I&rsquo;m actively looking in Portland, OR, Seattle, WA and Austin, TX, I&rsquo;m still looking to add other cities to my list--so don't hesitate to reach out.</p>
<p>Visit the i<a href="/interested_in_evangelism.php">nterested in evangelism page</a>, submit the form and I&rsquo;ll get you plugged in.</p>

<p>When you operate an API, you need to make sure and communicate with your developer community about what your plans are for the future, so developers can plan their own roadmap, and keep in sync with the coming changes to the API.</p>
<p>In addition to <a title="API issue management with Github" href="/2012/11/08/api-issue-management-using-github/">issue management using Github</a>, API providers can use Github to manage their roadmap using the milestones features of the social coding platform.  Milestones can be directly related to issues or can be larger goals around where you intend to take your API.</p>
<p>Milestones give developers insight into what the plans are the future of an API, using just a title, description and target date.  Milestones are one of the simplest aspects of an API, but can go a long way in creating goodwill with your developers.</p>
<p>API providers have to balance transparency versus giving away information to competitors, something that will take regular consideration.  A transparent roadmap for your API will let developers prepare properly, while also letting them know what features are coming in the future--eliminating the possibility of competing with your own ecosystem.</p>
<p>Consider what you can include in your Github roadmap, and using Github for issue management.</p>

<p>Backend as a Service (BaaS) provider <a title="CloudMine" href="https://cloudmine.me/">CloudMine</a> and aggregated social API platform <a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a> announced a partnership today, to make sure the mobile applications developers are building using CloudMine have social baked in by default.</p>
<p>CloudMine is delivering on the BaaS promise and providing all the tools developers need to rapidly develop and scale their mobile applications, by providing a complete backend solution for developers including user management, object storage, push notifications, syncing and other essential tools developers need to be successful.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/53044170?byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;badge=0" width="500" height="281"></iframe></p>

<p>Social is the logical next step in the BaaS evolution.  Social authentication, data, friends, followers are also essential for any developer building an app these days, so the partnership being CloudMine and Singly makes sense.  Instead of CloudMine aggregating these essential social tools, they can rely on Singly to bring this to the table for CloudMine developers--allowing CloudMine to stick with what they do best.</p>
<p>If you want more information, you can head over to <a title="CloudMine" href="http://blog.cloudmine.me/">CloudMine</a> or <a title="Singly" href="http://blog.singly.com/2012/11/12/teaming-up-with-cloudmine-for-backend-superpowers/">Singly</a>, and see how their approach can help your mobile app development.</p>

<p>Mobile app development is at the center of API deployment in 2012.  Much of the interest in designing, developing and deploying APIs is so that you can successfully launch one, or multiple mobile applications.</p>
<p>I get a lot of questions from companies looking to deploy APIs, where they can find development talent that will help them with their API driven mobile initiatives.  Up until now I didn&rsquo;t have much to offer them, any mobile developer I know that is good, is already snatched up, and without direct experience deploying projects with a development shop, I didn&rsquo;t have one to recommend.</p>
<p>Now that has changed, I&rsquo;ve been working with a rock star web and mobile dev shop called <a href="http://concentricsky.com/">Concentric Sky</a>. And over the last couple years I have really gotten to know their team of developers and management--and I&rsquo;ve been blown away by some of the projects they are producing:</p>

<p>Those are just a few of the amazing projects come out of <a href="http://concentricsky.com/">Concentric Sky</a>.  I&rsquo;m psyched to not just have a mobile and web development partner, but one of such high caliber.  I&rsquo;ve worked closely with their leadership, project managers and developers on a couple projects, lead their team on conference panels, and have made a habit of going out to lunch with members of their team when I&rsquo;m in town. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, in the future, when I get asked for recommendations of a mobile, web or API development shop, I&rsquo;ll be sending them to Concentric Sky.  Feel free to <a href="http://concentricsky.com/contact">contact them directly</a> and let them know I sent you, or you can contact me and I&rsquo;m happy to introduce you to their team.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Nov 2012</span>
        <p><a href="http://defragcon.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/defrag-2012/Defrag-2012-Conference.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I was trying to explain the experience of being at the <a href="http://defragcon.com/">Defrag Conference</a>, to a friend&nbsp;the other day.  We are both gearing up for the event, next week (November 14th &amp; 15th), in Broomfield Colorado, and he had never been to one so I wanted to share a little about what the experience is like.</p>
<p>The Defrag event is organized by Eric Norlin, who also organizes Gluecon and Blur conferences, all at the Omni Interlocken resort in Broomfield.  Each of Eric&rsquo;s events have evolved each year, but currently reflect the following focus:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://gluecon.com/2012/">Gluecon</a></strong> - Cloud, Mobile, APIs, Big Data for developers</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://defragcon.com/">Defrag</a></strong> - What's coming next  in technology</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.blurcon.com/">Blur</a></strong> - Human Computer Interaction (HCI)</li>
</ul>
<p>Eric has a unique way of bringing together the leaders from the space to discuss relevant technologies in a very intimate space.  The Omni Interlocken resort is a very key element to the events, which makes it unlike other events I attend.</p>
<p>The first of Eric&rsquo;s events I attended was a Gluecon, several years back.  We drove out to the location, and I remember thinking, &ldquo;oh man we are going to be stuck way out here for 4 days&rdquo;.  But as I learned, that is the point.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/defrag-2012/Omni-Interlocken.png" alt="" width="525" /></p>
<p>You are stuck in a very intimate location where you will eat killer grub, including beef sliders and drink some kick-ass craft beers while rubbing elbows and having deep technical and philosophical conversations with the deepest thinkers and leaders in our space.</p>
<p>Defrag and Glue are part of a small group of events I recommend you <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">never</span></strong> miss in the space.  I&rsquo;m pretty burnt out on large technology conferences, but the value you walk away with from Defrag can&rsquo;t be found anywhere else--putting Defrag in entireley different category for me.</p>
<p>I hope to see you at Defrag next week. If your there, I&rsquo;ll buy you an IPA, while we talk APIs.</p>

<p><a title="Github" href="https://github.com/">Github</a> should be the center of your API operations, with the most obvious use being for <a title="SDK repositories" href="/2012/10/25/sdk-management-for-your-api-with-github/">SDK repositories</a>, but Github offers a lot of other valuable tools that you can use to manage your API platform.</p>
<p>One great use of Github is as an API issue management tool.  The Github issue management system allows you to easily accept issue reports from your API community and apply labels to organize them into appropriate categories, for processing by your development team.</p>
<p>To setup Github Issue Management for your API, just create a new repository, but you won't actually being pushing any code, you will just be using it as a container for running issue management.  Think of it as repository for your API itself.</p>
<p>Once setup, you can link the issue management page directly from your API area, allowing users to actively submit issues, comment and potentially be part of the API product development cycle.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> isn't just for code.  Github can be used for HTML documents and PDF's as well.  This opens up endless possibilities for management of documents you wish to share with your developer ecosystem.</p>
<p>One excellent example of this is publishing presentations from the various talks, hackathons and conferences you present at.  When you are done with a talk and would like to share with your community, you can just expose it as a PDF or HTML document, and push to Github.</p>
<p>You can also use this same approach for how-to guides and training materials you want to make available for your developers.  Allowing them to download and fork, or even follow the changes on Github, for the richest training materials an API provides.</p>
<p>Github provides a powerful way for you to version, evolve and share your essential API resources with the community--keeping them in sync with all other activity around your API.</p>

<p>I'm digging on this statement from Gil Elbaz @ Factual. &nbsp;<span>Gil is participating on a panel &ldquo;The Forest for the Trees: The Meanings of Data&rdquo; at the&nbsp;<a href="http://techonomy.com/conf/12-tucson/" target="_blank">Techonomy Conference</a>&nbsp;</span><span>on Sunday, November 11th in Tucson, Arizona at the Ritz Carlton.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span><a href="http://blog.factual.com/gil-speaking-at-techonomy-on-the-meanings-of-data">We live in a world of patterns. Now we&rsquo;re getting better at discerning them. As we see the big patterns in human behavior, and in the movement of money, products, jobs, weather, energy, disease, and even molecules and stars, a new era of understanding dawns. Can companies and governments draw proper conclusions fast enough? Where will this world of patterns discerned take us?</a></span></p>
<p>I've heard Gil talk several times, and I am a big believer in his views on data, and supporter of <a href="http://www.factual.com/">Factual as a platform</a>. I firmly believe we can help companies and government draw proper conclusions, in very real-time ways, using APIs.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/11/05/api-kpis-should-be-optimized-for-developer-success/">API KPIs Should Be Optimized for Developer Success</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">05 Nov 2012</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/funnel.jpeg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>When it comes to measuring the success of an API, we often experience a lack meaningful metrics, with <a title="many companies only tracking the number of new developers and quantity of API calls" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/05/15/developing-more-meaningful-api-metrics/">many companies only tracking the number of new developers and quantity of API calls</a>.  Going beyond these basic API metrics and identifying true performance indicators (KPI), will be essential if you want to find success with your API.</p>
<p>To speak in a more traditional marketing sense, a pretty standard sales funnel can be used to set the stage, defining the intake of developers as the top of your funnel, paid accounts and production applications the bottom of your APIs funnel--giving you a common framework for hanging KPIs on. &nbsp;</p>
<p>However, when using a sales funnel to frame your API marketing efforts, be careful of being blinded that success will all be all about moving developers from the top, to the bottom of your funnel.  While this is definitely a large part of your efforts, there are plenty of good things that can happen within the funnel that will further drive users into the funnel as well as build trust and evangelism efforts that can be essential to the growth of your API ecosystem.</p>
<p>When planning your API sales funnel, the top is all about bringing in new registrations and the bottom should reflect the business objectives of your API.  But your funnel flow shouldn't always consist of direct flow to the bottom--think about what other beneficial activities can happen within the funnel:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Talent Acquisition</strong> -   Finding new developers who understand your API and market</li>
<li><strong>Social Media Marketing</strong> - Tweets and other social media exhaust for users</li>
<li><strong>Story Building</strong> - New stories you can tell about the value your API delivers</li>
<li><strong>Idea Generation</strong> - Creative ideas around how to use your API</li>
<li><strong>Feedback</strong> - Quality feedback from developers about how to make your API better</li>
<li><strong>Evangelists</strong> - Develop the next generation of developer evangelists and advocates</li>
<li><strong>Brand</strong> - Awareness of your brand and the value it represents</li>
<li><strong>Trust</strong> - The trust of developers who will use your API to solve problems in the future</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these activities can boost the strength of your operations, others can feed the bottom line and meet your funnel objectives, but all of them will work to bring more developers into the top of the funnel--helping you scale.</p>
<p>To properly define your API funnel, you need to begin by profiling developers, as they come in the door, and try to figure out where they fit.  Don&rsquo;t assume all developers will be there to build production ready app and drive revenue for your company.  Developers come in all shapes and sizes.  Get to know your developers, who they are and understand where they fit into the equation.  Don&rsquo;t scare off developers who can benefit the ecosystem with an aggressive sales approach..</p>
<p>When establishing and evolving the key performance indicators for your API, make sure be developer centric in your measurements and decisions--don&rsquo;t make them just about monetization and the bottom line.  If you optimize for developer success, when it comes to web APis you&rsquo;ll often find success in all other areas of your API operations.</p>

<p>I call it being an evangelist, but it has other names, such as advocate or ambassador.  Someone who is good at evangelism, in my opinion, starts with a love of hacking but is also having a love of helping others learn and understand technology.  I can&rsquo;t help being an evangelist, it&rsquo;s just part of my personality.</p>
<p>These days, I get enough requests for evangelists, so I decided to start finding passionate hackers within specific communities to help fill requests.  Some requests for evangelists are full time positions, some part time, while others involve just going to meetups and hackathons in evenings and on weekends as needed.</p>
<p>Currently I&rsquo;m on the hunt for some passionate hacker personalities in New York, Chicago, Boston, Seattle, Denver, Austin, Atlanta and Portland.  If you live in these cities, are passionate about API, mobile, social and the cloud--you should consider a life of evangelism.</p>
<p>Even if you aren&rsquo;t quite sure what an evangelist, advocate or ambassador does, feel free to reach out.  Chances are you are already attending meetups, hackathons and already doing evangelism activities--you just aren&rsquo;t getting paid or receiving incentives to do so.</p>

<p>One very powerful way to use <a title="Github" href="https://github.com/">Github</a> within your API strategy is for developer profiling.  This approach requires the deployment of another Github solution, API <a title="Developer login using Github" href="/2012/10/29/api-developer-login-using-github/">Developer login using Github</a>.</p>
<p>After you implement authentication for you API using Github, the <a href="https://www.singly.com/docs/github">Github API</a> provides a wealth of opportunity for you to learn more about developers.</p>
<p>The types of developers you want for your API are also developers who have an active Github profiles.  Using Github, you can immediately tell if someone is an active developer based upon their presence and usage of the social coding network.</p>
<p>Github provides basic profile details, like where a developer lives and which programming language they use.  You can also see which other tools and code they following and commit to, giving an overall profile of their developer lifestyle.</p>
<p>Using Github you will also be able to tell if a user has downloaded or forked your own API SDK's, giving you insight into how well your SDK"s are being received and used.   There are endless ways you can use Github to stay in tune with your developers, but first you have to employ <a title="Github authentication as part of your API strategy" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/09/05/provide-api-developers-with-github-login-using-singly/">Github authentication as part of your API strategy</a>--then get to work profiling developers, and better understand who they are.</p>

        <p>I spend a lot of time trying to find company logos and a little blurb about what a company does. &nbsp;You'd think in this cloudy API driven world there would a simpler way. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I decided to create my own solution. &nbsp;I created an <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/about.json" target="_blank">about.json file for API Evangelist</a>.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/4003224.js?file=about.json"></script>
<p>When you need my company logo, a quick description about API Evangelist or other key information like my Twitter account or Blog RSS, you know where to find it.</p>
<p>Now, could you please create one for your company? &nbsp;You can copy my about.json above, go to <a href="http://jsoneditoronline.org/">JSON Editor Online</a>, paste it in and create your own. &nbsp;When done, make sure and save to your desktop as text file and upload to the root of your site. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll always take a look at http://example.com/about.json first to see if a company has it, before Googling on my own for a logo and about blurb.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Nov 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/electronic-frontier-foundation/electronic-frontier-foundation-logo.gif" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/11/no-copyrights-apis-help-us-make-case">Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) needs our help</a> to explain to the Federal Circuit Court on why there should <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span></strong> be copyrights on APIs.  As EFF published today:</p>
<blockquote><em>Earlier this year, we applauded District Court Judge Alsup for getting it right and holding that, as a matter of law, one could not copyright APIs. The case, Oracle v. Google, is now on appeal to the Federal Circuit, where a three-judge panel is going to revisit Judge Alsup&rsquo;s ruling.</em></blockquote>
<p>The EFF is soliciting the our assistance in how to help build the case, asking for feedback on two example areas:</p>
<ol class="mainlist">
<li>Software reimplementing someone else&rsquo;s API, calling someone else&rsquo;s API, or any other uses of third-party APIs for interoperability, competition, or innovation.</li>
<li>Reimplementation of an API, where the resulting software benefitted the original API creator, perhaps by increasing the creator&rsquo;s user base or otherwise benefitted the developer community</li>
</ol>
<p>I think we are in the infancy of API deployment, so it&rsquo;s going to be tough to find many solid examples. &nbsp;But I think the two areas we can demonstrate the importance of no copyright on APIs, is within two business sectors that evolved on the web, using APIs and are critical to business and government today:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Cloud</strong> - As EFF said, Eucalyptus reimplemented the Amazon API to offer a competing cloud storage service.  You also saw the same with <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/2010/09/01/google-storage-for-developers-interoperability/">first implementation of Google Developer Storage</a> and up to &amp; other providers: <a href="http://trac.cyberduck.ch/wiki/help/en/howto/dunkel">Dunkel Cloud Storage</a>, <a href="http://www.hosteurope.de/produkte/Cloud-Storage">âHost Europe Cloud Storage</a>, <a href="http://trac.cyberduck.ch/wiki/help/en/howto/greenqloud">GreenQloud Storage Qloud</a>, <a href="http://www.scaleupcloud.com/">ScaleUp Technologies</a>, <a href="https://www.mh.connectria.com/rp/order/cloud_storage_index">âConnectria Cloud Storage</a>, <a href="http://trac.cyberduck.ch/wiki/help/en/howto/lunacloud">Lunacloud</a>, and <a href="http://trac.cyberduck.ch/wiki/help/en/howto/dreamobjects">DreamObjects Cloud Storage</a>&nbsp;providing unprecedented interoperability for cloud computing.</li>
<li><strong>Social</strong> - Same as with cloud you have seen competition pop up for both Twitter and Facebook, mimicking their platform and APIs.  Platforms like <a title="App.net" href="https://join.app.net/">App.net</a> have copied Twitter&rsquo;s social network providing competition, and potential value to Twitter users by allowing developers to use App.net for things they can't use Twitter for.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think another clear example of open API design being used to help users is Pinboard&rsquo;s implementation of the Delicious API:</p>
<ol class="mainlist"> 
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="85" align="center" valign="top"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/pinboard/pinboard-icon.png" alt="" width="75" /></td>
<td><strong><a title="Pinboard" href="http://pinboard.in/api/">Pinboard</a></strong> - Wherever possible the Pinboard API uses the same syntax and method names as the Delicious V1 API. This implementation allowed users to seamlessly export Delicious bookmarks accumulated over several years to Pinboard when Delicious was sold by Yahoo. &nbsp;If Yahoo had copyrighted their API design, Pinboard could never have done this.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</ol>
<p>A slightly different approach to offering benefit to users via an open API design is surrounding the Instagram API:</p>
<ol class="mainlist"> 
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="85" align="center" valign="top"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/instagram/instagram-icon-250.png" alt="" width="75" /></td>
<td><strong><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/02/08/instagram-launches-api/">Instagram API </a></strong>- In 2010, before Instagram itself launched an API, a passionate developer launched a rogue API for the popular photo sharing platform based upon Instagram's own internal API design they used to drive the popular iPhone application.  The move showed Instagram the demand for an API, and after designing and launching their own asked the rogue API to shut down.  A slightly different scenario, but if API design was copyright this may not have been possible.  We&rsquo;ve seen the same approach with a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/05/25/lack-of-pinterest-api-is-a-lack-of-api-business-strategy/">rogue Pinterest API</a>, but it hasn&rsquo;t resulted in the same response from Pinterest unfortunately.   But community driven API design has a lot of potential for opening up companies and encouraging API innovation.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</ol>
<p>I strongly believe that APIs have massive potential for innovation across many business sectors.  The copyright of API design would eliminate much of this potential.  Open API design allows for healthy competition, interoperability and innovation as we&rsquo;ve seen with cloud and social.  But open API design can also augment the lack of standards through market leadership, helping grow healthy industries and essential online utilities.  Amazon EC2 and S3 design standards are clear examples of this in the wild.</p>
<p>Cloud and social are fast become essential components in our everyday lives, but open API have the potential to become mission critical with implementations like <a href="http://open311.org/">Open311</a>.  Some API designs are just too important to be proprietary.   I would argue Twitter, Amazon S3 and Amazon EC2 also fall into this category and need to remain open for the greater good.</p>
<p>Open API design reuse represents the future of API communication.  Companies like <a title="Singly" href="https://singly.com/">Singly</a>, <a title="Temboo" href="https://www.temboo.com/">Temboo</a>, <a title="Webshell" href="http://webshell.io/">Webshell</a> and <a title="Zapier" href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a> are building API aggregation, automation, and languages that very much rely on flexible API terms of use, as well as API design reuse.  Copyright of API design would prevent companies from openly competing, offering redunancy as well as limit new and more meaningful APIs to be derived from existing API implementations.</p>
<p>Without the ability to copy, mimic, mashup, translate, emulate and re-define API design we won&rsquo;t be able to become more fluent in communicating via web and mobile apps using APIs.  We are just beginning to understand online communication via the power of mobile apps.  As we still grunt and groan while communicating via APIs--let&rsquo;s not stunt our growth and development with allowing API design to be copyrighted.</p>

        <span class="post-date">30 Oct 2012</span>
        <p>Dear API Strategy Attendee,<br /><br />As you know we've been tracking the weather events affecting New York. Up until now we've been hoping to run the event much as planned and working around the logistics issues that have come up.<br /><br />We were hoping for better news this morning but the situation in New York is still very serious with extensive storm damage, mass-transit and airports with uncertain reopening times and in some areas there are still emergency rescue situations on-going. There has already been significant travel disruption and it looks set to get worse (none of the event team has yet been been able to get to New York and a number of speakers are already unable to fly).<br /><br />As a result we've had to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">take the tough decision to postpone the event and not run it this week</span>. It's very dissapointing for everybody we realize (not least the team) and we'd wanted to fight through and make everything work but as of this time:<br /><br />- We don't think we'd be able to run much of the program and hence the event would<br />&nbsp; not reach the great potential it had.<br /><br />- There are safety concerns and for people traveling very possible serious travel chaos.<br /><br />Lastly, people on the ground in the city likely have other things to focus on than the event - staying safe and securing everything.<br /><br />So if you were planning to travel, please do not - the event won't take place unfortunately. However, this is a postponement and the event will definitely take place - we're committed to making it happen and making it happen in New York. We will get back to you with new dates and consultation in the next few days.<br /><br />We will certainly work with speakers and sponsors to make sure the program is just as good and likely even better + we'll aim to do it as proximately as possible given people's logistics.<br /><br />All tickets will remain valid for the new event when it runs, however if dates do not fit for you we will reimburse you. We'll keep you posted on that news.<br /><br />Our apologies from the team that we've had to take this decision but we really see no other option. We'll be back with news as soon as we can on a new date / time / venue and in the meantime we hope everybody stays safe.<br /><br />We thank everybody for the awesome support and advice -<br /><br />Kin, Steve and Vanessa</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/github/github-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" />As with most social platforms, <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> provides oAuth for their platform, allowing developers to provide secure credentials and authentication for their users via a Github account.</p>
<p>Service providers like <a title="Singly" href="https://singly.com/">Singly</a> are providing two click authentication using Github's oAuth.  This allows any website or app to offer their users the ability to login with their Github profile.</p>
<p>Allowing authentication via Github is no brainer for API providers. Why require users to create yet another login, or even use <a href="https://www.singly.com/docs/twitter">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.singly.com/docs/facebook">Facebook</a> oAuth?  Allow them to login and retrieve API keys via the one social profile that reflects the programmer side of their online profile.</p>
<p>Github login can be implemented in any programming language, and because it is oAuth, it is something end users will understand.  In addition to providing easy authentication, you will be able to immediately see other important data about a developer that is available via their Github profile.</p>
<p>Consider the potential of using Github authentication as part of your API strategy.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Oct 2012</span>
        <p><a title="Pearson" href="http://developer.pearson.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/pearson/pearson-logo.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>One API I&rsquo;ve been watching grow and evolve from day one is the <a title="Pearson Developer Community" href="http://developer.pearson.com/">Pearson Developer Community</a>.  I first wrote about them when Peasron <a title="announced a new initiative to build an API platform that give developers access to the publisher's content" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/10/pearson-plans-api-platform-to-unlock-content/">announced a new initiative to build an API platform that give developers access to the publisher's content</a> in May of 2011.  Then in <a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/08/16/re-inventing-pearson-publishing-using-apis/">August 2011 they launched three APIs</a>:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/longman-dictionary/apimethod/get-entry-0/189/overview">Longman Dictionary</a></strong> - The Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English is the flagship Longman dictionary</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/ft-press/apimethod/get-book-block/189/overview">FT Press</a></strong> - FT Press provides essential insights from the best business books and original writings by leading business thinkers</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/eyewitness-guides/apimethod/entries-guide/189/overview">Eyewitness Guides</a> </strong>- The DK Eyewitness Travel Guides show you what others only tell you</li>
</ul>
<p>After Pearson got acquainted with the ins and outs of API evangelism, and supporting the Pearson developer community, they <a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2012/06/18/launching-apis-one-book-at-a-time/">released two more APIs</a> this year:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/pearson-kitchen-manager/apimethod/courses/190/overview">Pearson Kitchen Manager</a> </strong>- Pearson Kitchen Manager is a valuable resource for food enthusiasts and chefs alike, featuring a vast collection of recipes from bestselling Pearson textbooks of top culinary schools</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/nursing-health-survival-guides-api/apimethod/get-article/189/overview">Nursing &amp; Health Survival Guides API</a> </strong>- The best-selling Pearson Nursing &amp; Health Survival Guide series is the UK's premier quick reference, aide memoire support for health and social care students and professionals while in practice and studying</li>
</ul>
<p>It looks like Pearson is really finding a rhythm with identifying content to make available, as well as the right approach to deploying as APIs. They have 3 more high value publishing APIs available:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/penguin-classics-api/apimethod/get-article-1/189/overview">Penguin Classics API </a></strong>- The Penguin English Library is a collection of 100 of the best novels ever written in the English Language. Classics like Jane Eyre, Dracula and Great Expectations </li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/dkimages-api/apimethod/list-images/189/overview">dkimages API</a> </strong>- The dkimages API is an encyclopaedic collection of 90,000 high-resolution images</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/peachpit-visual-quickstart-guides-api/apimethod/get-article-0/190/overview">Peachpit Visual QuickStart Guides API</a></strong> - With more than 12 million copies in print, Visual QuickStart Guides have been a vital part of the computer book category for years</li>
</ul>
<p>That is a total of 8 APIs endpoints Pearson has made available via their developer center--providing some valuable text and image content that developers can use to build web and mobile apps.</p>
<p>What impresses me with Pearson is that they&rsquo;ve found an efficient way to identify valuable assets within legacy inventory, part them out and expose these valuable parts and pieces as APIs.  Essentially giving them a new life--driving web, mobile and tablet applications.</p>
<p>Pearson has deployed their developer center with all the <a title="essential API building blocks" href="/the_building_blocks_of_a_successful_api.php">essential API building blocks</a>, while also executing an efficient API evangelism campaign around their APis, and delivering value to developers.  It&rsquo;s a commendable operation for such a big publisher.</p>
<p>If you are interested in hearing more about what Pearson is up to with their APIs, you can catch them at the <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference this week in NYC</a>.  Pearson will be presenting as part of a media API session as well as helping sponsor the event, to make sure we can all get together an have these conversations.</p>

<p>Code samples in a variety of languages are how API owners help developers understand an API in the language that makes the most sense to them.</p>
<p>Not all developers will understand REST, HTTP and other things you might take for granted.  Very simple code samples will help demonstrate an APIs functionality, making the learning process a hands-on experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> provides a very lightweight tool for publishing API code samples, that can be embedded on any website, called <a title="Gist" href="https://gist.github.com/">Gists</a>.  You can easily copy / paste a working code sample into a Gist and Github returns a lightweight, embeddable JavaScript that you can use in documentation, blog posts and any where you will need to share with users.</p>
<p>Github Gists can be a much sexier, and easier to implement alternative to html &lt;code&gt; tags. While also allowing easy management and versioning of API code samples alongside <a title="Github API SDK Management" href="/2012/10/25/sdk-management-for-your-api-with-github/">Github API SDK repositories</a>.</p>

<p>The most common use of <a title="Github" href="http://www.github.com">Github</a> by API providers is to publish API SDK's to the popular social coding platform.  If you look at most of the the top API providers in operation today, you will find they are actively using Github to not just manage and publicize their API SDK's, but actively interact with their developer ecosystem in the process.</p>
<p>Github provides the necessary workflow for initial design, development and publicizing of API SDKs, allowing owners to create separate repositories for web-based SDKs like PHP, Python and Ruby and mobile SDKs for iOS, Android and Windows mobile.</p>
<p>By making API SDK's public repositories on Github you get all the code management benefits of Github, but also make them available for social interaction by your developers.  They will be able to download, fork and potentially commit additions and modifications back to an SDK's repository, allowing owners to harness the creative potential of the developer community.</p>
<p>Active Github repositories for an API are an essential part of any API ecosystem.  If you don't use Github for anything else, make sure you publish your SDK's as a public repository. It will make the development of your client libraries a much more social experience, providing huge benefits for your API.</p>

        <p><a title="APIPhany" href="http://www.apiphany.com/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/apiphany/APIphany-Logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I get so busy sometimes my stories pile up. Some only seeing the light of day when I get caught up on research, projects, travels and speaking. On story I&rsquo;ve been meaning to write for almost 3 months now is about <a title="APIPhany" href="http://www.apiphany.com/">APIphany</a>, one of the new generation of API providers.  I met the APIphany team in person when I went out to Washington DC in August.</p>
<p>The APIphany team was cool enough to come out and support my <a title="API Craft Washington DC" href="/2012/08/18/api-craft-washington-dc/">API Craft meetup in DC</a>, then the next morning I went out to their offices and met the rest of the team.  APIphany sees the industry very similar to me, and believe in self-service, pay as you go API services that allow for anyone to innovate around APIs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been watching their progress and they have 3 very cool projects made public so far:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.washingtonpost.com/">Washington Post</a> -</strong> Developer area for Washington Post, providing some endpoints including an Issue Engine API, White House Visitors Log API,  and the Campaign Finance API</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.ridemetro.apiphany.com/">Houston Metro</a> -</strong> Developer portal for the Houston area, providing public transit in the Houston metropolitan area for bus and rail</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.votinginfoproject.org/">The Voting Information Project (VIP)</a> </strong>- Offering APIs and developers tools to provide voters with access to customized election information, helping them navigate the voting process and cast an informed vote</li>
</ul>
<p>When I met the team in August, they described how they were building out so many custom projects for customers that were API driven, they decided to standardize their approach and offer a product.  The APIphany API management solution provides all the standard offerings we are getting used to in the space:</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/apiphany/apiphany-team.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Administration Portal</li>
<li>Developer Portal</li>
<li>Key Management</li>
<li>Access Control and Security</li>
<li>Subscriptions and Billing</li>
<li>Monitoring</li>
<li>Analytics and Reporting</li>
</ul>
<p>APIphany also gives you the ability to host the API in a variety of cloud providers, and my favorite is they provide you with an API to manage your API.  The team has been building and managing web APIs for government, enterprise, and non-profit customers since 2006--so they get it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.apiphany.com/">APIphany</a> is also supporting the <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference</a> in New York City, November 1st and 2nd.  If you want to meet the team, you should make sure your there--if not just head over to <a title="apiphany.com" href="http://apiphany.com">apiphany.com</a> to talk with them directly.</p>

<p>While I was <a href="/2012/10/24/my-presentation-to-the-presidential-innovation-fellows/">out in Washington DC this week</a>, one of the Presidential Innovation Fellows in my workshop was from the Department of Energy, and shared one of the best examples of APIs delivering value I&rsquo;ve seen in awhile.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://bioenergykdf.net/">US Department of Energy has developed the Bioenergy Knowledge Discovery Framework</a> (KDF), which is a platform for researchers and engineers from national laboratories, academia, and private industries to upload files, customize information online, and exchange knowledge with each other.</p>
<p>The Bioenergy Knowledge Discovery Framework provides acess to a landmark &ldquo;Billion-Ton&rdquo; bioenergy study on fuel resources, providing a wealth of information from a variety of researchers.   The study generated a large volume of interest, and resulted in numerous requests for raw data disclosure from the researchers.</p>
<p>In response the project deployed a web API, providing direct access to raw data, saving the resources necessary to reach out to researchers as well as the researchers valuable time in processing requests and providing data.</p>
<p>The US Department of Energy estimates they <span style="text-decoration: underline;">saved $882,000</span> in operational costs and researchers valuable time by bundling the API with the bioenergy study.</p>
<p>This is why I evangelize APIs.  The US Department of Energy case study demonstrates not just the value of APIs, but how they can actually make government more efficient and save tax payers money.</p>
<p>In addition I strongly advocate that&nbsp;<a title="APIs and raw data access should be default" href="http://kinlane.com/2012/05/15/diving-deeper-into-data-from-research/">APIs and raw data access should be default</a> for all studies and resulting reports, allowing anyone to dive deeper into the research and provide additional insights.</p>

<p>Out of date API documentation is by far the most common mistake API providers make, and also the <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2010/08/12/web-api-documentation-best-practices/">number one pain point for API developers</a>.  It makes sense that you will want to keep your API documentation in sync with each version of your API, and one way to handle this is to version them both, using Github.</p>
<p>To use Github for your API documentation, all you need to do is create an single public repository, which you can use to manage HTML versions of your API docs.  By putting your API documentation in its own repository you can keep the version of the API code repository in sync with it's corresponding documentation.</p>
<p>With the API documentation in Github, you can then easily publish to your API area or just allow developers to go directly to the Github repository and browse documentation there.</p>
<p>To help you edit your API documentation, you can use tools like <a href="http://prose.io/">prose.io</a>,&nbsp;which will allow even non-developers to assist in maintaining API documentation, with all changes stored neatly in a central Github repository.</p>
<p>Storing API docs in Github will also make them more portable.  Some developers may wish to download a copy for offline work, or just prefer having locally for their own reference.</p>
<p>With the right approach to managing your API docs with Github, you can easily keep them up to date, in sync with your API, while also making them easily accessible by all API consumers--without much of the headache often associated with managing API documentation.</p>

<p>I spent two hours with a handful of the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/innovationfellows">Presidential Innovation Fellows</a> in Washington DC yesterday.  They were some super savvy folks from a wide variety of agencies and backgrounds including education, energy and health.</p>
<p>During my two hours with them I walked through several areas of  the API industry, from my perspective, including:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>History of APIs</li>
<li>API Planning &amp; Design</li>

If you&rsquo;d like a custom presentation on it, let me know and I&rsquo;ll see if I can find a slot to do a Google Hangout.</p>
<p>I had a blast talking to the Presidential Fellows, and I hope that I left them with some value that will help them be successful in their various initiatives.  They are already halfway through their sprint, and have a lot of expectations put on them.</p>

        <span class="post-date">24 Oct 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/federal-government/government-owners-uncle-sam.jpeg" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p>I had a great discussion with a friend who works in federal government yesterday.  We were talking about various ways to &ldquo;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">successfully</span>&rdquo; deploy APIs within the federal government.  She gets APIs, understands the benefits, but she had some very realistic perspectives on where API deployment within the federal government can fail.</p>
<p>While discussing this with her, we kept coming back to two points:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>API Garbage Littering the Internet</strong> - With some of the tools, making it easier to deploy APIs, the potential to just post meaningless and worthless data sets grows</li>
<li><strong>Lack of API Ownership </strong>- There are big movements to get APIs deployed, but then very little ownership once its up.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regarding worthless APIs being deployed, I think we can mitigate this by providing some sort of ranking or voting systems for APIs, allowing developers to upvote or downvote and add some critical feedback on what is right, or what is wrong.  This will allow the &ldquo;cream&rdquo; to rise to the top, and everything else just disappear from view.</p>
<p>Next, her perspective on lack of API ownership after an API is launched, is a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">very big problem</span>.  It is something I see in the public sector all the time.  Everyone gets excited about standing up an API, but once it&rsquo;s in the wild, they lose enthusiasm--leaving the API to whither on the vine.</p>
<p>APIs will not succeed if they do not have an owner.  For technology companies, it might make sense for them to have an API as a product, assemble a team and dedicate resources to the API. &nbsp;Even hire an evangelist or advocate.</p>
<p>When it comes to government, maybe we need a different approach.  A sort of personal API deployment platform like <a title="Socrata API Foundry" href="http://www.socrata.com/api-foundry/">Socrata API Foundry</a>, that will let anyone publish a dataset as API--allowing any individual to achieve "machine readable by default", as <a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2012/06/01/barak-obama-directs-all-federal-agencies-to-have-an-api/">directed by President Obama back in May</a>.</p>
<p>By empowering data owners within government to publish themselves, and give them the tools to handle the business of their APIs, and interact directly with consumers, maybe we can ensure APIs have an owner--one that cares about the data and truly understand the value it offers.</p>
<p>Just some quick thoughts, from a great conversation.  I will flush out more ideas on this as soon as I can.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/10/24/a-hackathon-philosophy-from-warren-wilbee-of-microsoft/">A Hackathon Philosophy From Warren Wilbee of Microsoft</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">24 Oct 2012</span>
        <p><a href="https://twitter.com/wwilbee" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/microsoft/warren-wilbee-microsoft.jpeg" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>While doing the weekly hackathon roundup in September, I noticed an uptick in the number of <a title="Windows 8 Hackathons" href="http://whosin.com/pg/whois/20074247/Warren+Wilbee">Windows 8 hackathons</a> that are going on.  I decided to reach out to Microsoft and see if I can get more information on what they are trying to accomplish, and see what their perspective is on hackathons.</p>
<p>After talking to several people I was directed to a gentleman by the name of Warren Wilbee (<a href="https://twitter.com/wwilbee" target="_blank">@wwilbee</a>), Director of ISV Evangelism at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx">Microsoft</a>.  Wilbee is a passionate evangelist, one that isn't just externally evangelizing, he is actively working to evolve internal culture and options about the value of hackathons at Microsoft.  When I got on the phone with him, he said the reason I was directed to him is because he had recently circulated an internal memo regarding the makeup and value of hackathons.</p>
<p>He feels strong that hackathons are very useful, you get the opportunity to get X number of people into a room, doing exactly what you want--delivering a very direct result. "Hackathons are purpose built", when you put on a hackathon for developers you get to define exactly what you, sending the desired message your company wants developers to receive, says Wilbee. By contrast, sponsoring a hackathon is a very different exercise and value proposition--proceed with caution.  The hackathon organizer gets to define the purpose and drive the outcomes. The sponsor will not have access to this value, potentially excluding you from all the marketing or social "halo" produced at the event.  Sometimes there are opportunities to offer a prize that will be in-line with the organizers purpose, but just flashing your logo will not deliver much value to your company.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.devcamps.ms/"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/microsoft/windows-8-hackathons.jpeg" alt="" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>When you do put on a hackathon, Wilbee is passionate about it being a "participatory event". Get your people to come and participate, don't just require them to show up, make it part of their responsibility to be involved.  There is a social and community aspect to hackathons, "the shared experience of being in a room at 3am, committed to a common goal is a galvanizing, bonding experience." This is something you get by just showing up for a short period of time or just sponsoring an event.</p>
<p>In Wilbee&rsquo;s opinion APIs and software platforms are here to stay, and hackathons do a great job educating people about the value they deliver.  We will definitely see more organized efforts around these types of events, across many business sectors, in the future.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/10/22/open-source-your-api-with-github/">Open Source Your API With Github</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">22 Oct 2012</span>
        <p><a title="Github" href="https://github.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/github/github-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a title="Github" href="https://github.com/">Github</a>&nbsp;is a frequently used service in the toolbox of API owners.  The most common use of Github is for publishing API SDKs in a variety of languages and platforms.  But when it comes to truly being an "open API", some API owners are actually open sourcing their API design using Github.</p>
<p>Open sourcing the design of your API will not be sensible for every provider.  Many companies are looking to ensure developers use their API, maintaining an advantage over competitors.  However in some cases, open sourcing the design of your API is a way to ensure interoperability between partners or among mutliple companies within a certain business sector.</p>
<p>Simple examples of an API design might be for common systems like blogs, news, links, calendars or other API designs that don't deliver any sort of proprietary offerings.  If you are looking to ensure synchronicity between say, the calendar of multiple organizations, developing a single API and open sourcing the design and possibly a version of it in multiple programming languages, might make sense.</p>
<p>With a consistent API design, and code to deploy the API, any organization can download or fork the Github code, deploy the API for themselves--ensuring consistency and interoperability between any deployment. If a single organizations has unique needs, they can extend and commit the code back to Github, allowing the central repository manager to decide if it is a change that should be added to the core offering.</p>
<p>Not all APIs are created equal. &nbsp;Consider the possibility of actually open sourcing your API, the benefits it might bring to others, as well as your organization--they might exceed keeping it closed and proprietary.</p>
<p>This approach to using Github, is by far the truest meaning of the word, "Open API".</p>

<p>When <a href="/2012/10/20/the-right-partnership-for-the-api-strategy--practice-conference/">3Scale and I first decided to do the API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference</a> in New York, one of the first people I reached out to about speaking and sponsoring the event, was Laura Merling (<a href="https://twitter.com/magicmerl">@magicmerl</a>), SVP Applications Enablement Platform and Strategy at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.alcatel-lucent.com/open-api-platform/">Alcatel-Lucent</a>.</p>
<p>As soon as I told her about the event, she said &ldquo;We are in! What do we need to do, to support it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m stoked to have Laura kick off the event on Thursday, November 1st with a keynote as well as having <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/sponsors.php">Alcatel-Lucent as a gold sponsor.</a></p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve never heard Laura speak, I highly recommend making sure you are there.  She always has great insight into the success Alcatel-Lucent is having within emerging markets and the telco space. &nbsp;Also, her talks are always positive, energetic and demonstrate leadership in the space--something I want my daughter Kaia to experience.</p>
<p>During Laura&rsquo;s keynote I&rsquo;m sure we will here more about <a href="/2012/09/06/alcatel-lucent-open-sources-their-api-management-platform/">Alcatel-Lucent's new open source offering, API Grove</a>, as well as their openly licensed <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/16/alcatel-lucent-creates-methodology-for-apis-and-makes-available-under-creative-commons/">API lifecycle and methodology</a>.</p>
<p>Make sure you <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/register.php">get registered</a> today, before the event is sold out--there aren&rsquo;t many tickets left. &nbsp;I'll see you there.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference</a> is kicking off in 12 days in New York City.  The event will be keynotes, sessions and panels from over <a title="60 leading individuals across all sectors of the API industry" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/speakers.php">60 leading individuals across all sectors of the API industry</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve wanted to have an API industry event that was about ideas, practice and strategy, not just about companies, their products and clients for a while now.  This is something that I could never achieve on my own.  I just don&rsquo;t have the money or all the connections to bring everyone together.</p>
<p>To make API Strategy &amp; Practice happen it took the right partnership.  That partnership is with <a title="API service provider 3Scale" href="http://www.3scale.net/">API service provider 3Scale</a>.  The 3Scale team views the industry much like I do, that by openly educating people about the benefits of APIs and discussing the technical, business and political challenges we face in the industry--we can truly make change across all business sectors. &nbsp;Allowing all of us to be succesful in whatever products and services we provide.</p>
<p>Through the regular discussion I have with the 3Scale team, we discovered our shared desire to have such an API industry event.  We discussed what the event would look like, then quickly started figuring out what it would take to make it happen.  We felt we both had resources necessary to pull it off, and even though there is a lot of risk, that it was something that had to happen, for the benefit of the industry.</p>
<p>Here we are, 8 weeks later, and the event is a reality.   I just wanted to say thanks to 3Scale for not just sharing my vision of the API industry, but also partnering with me to make this event a reality.  I hope all my readers can make it to the event and participate in the discussions about APIs, platforms, mobile, and how we can all work to solve the biggest challenges in the space. &nbsp;This discussion will allow all of us to make significant change across all business sectors and at all levels of government using APIs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Oct 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/open.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>When I set out to put on an API industry event in early 2012, I had grand visions of what it would be.  Getting everyone together to discuss the best ideas, approaches the  industry has to offer--while also discussing the critical topics such as open APIs, developer rights, monetization, etc.</p>
<p>Fast forward 10 months, and the event is a reality, and even though it doesn&rsquo;t exactly look like I imagined, it is damn close--with&nbsp;<a title="lots of amazing API discussions" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/sessions.php">lots of amazing API discussions</a>.</p>
<p>After I <a title="API event has 60 speakers" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/speakers.php">announced the event has 60 speakers</a>&nbsp;yesterday,  I saw a tweet from Dave Winer (<a title="@DaveWiner" href="https://twitter.com/davewiner">@davewiner</a>):</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" style="padding-left: 35px;">
<p>A conference about APIs with only speakers representing corporate APIs. Not one open API, so no interop. Lost.<a title="http://0ox.r2.ly/" href="http://t.co/VBmfy5nb">0ox.r2.ly</a></p>

<script src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
<p>Now for those of you who don&rsquo;t read entire posts, I&rsquo;m NOT going after Dave.  We&rsquo;ve already tweeted back and forth and discussed, and he is supportive.  This post is about my feelings and thoughts on "open", and how we can all work together to make sure the industry is as open as possible.</p>
<p>First, I don&rsquo;t see things as black and white.  When it comes to politics, life or the API industry.  To ability to snap our fingers and everything becomes open will not happen.  It will be a lot of hard work and be very painful.</p>
<p>Next, I can honestly say there isn&rsquo;t anyone else in the space who is dedicated to open APIs as much as I am.  Sure Dave is much bigger name and has more history on this, but this is ALL I do.  Period.  I don&rsquo;t work on anything else. It is my day and night job.</p>
<p>I have written constantly about the need for <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/04/04/open-building-blocks-for-an-api/">open API building blocks</a>, <a title="open API billing and traffic control" href="/2011/05/21/open-source-api-billing-and-traffic-control/">open API billing and traffic control</a>, all while constantly <a title="what open even means" href="http://apivoice.com/2012/05/30/public-api-vs-open-api/">asking what open even means</a>?  My evangelism has helped guide two of the service providers in the space to deliver the first enterprise grade open source API products, from <a title="WSO2" href="http://wso2.com/products/api-manager/">WSO2</a> and <a title="Alcatel-Lucent" href="http://apigrove.net/">Alcatel-Lucent</a>. &nbsp;While these products aren't everything I want, they are a start.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a firm believer in constantly discussing what &ldquo;open&rdquo; means.  Is it free access, write capabilities, TOS, open source software under the hood, distributed technology, embracing open standards or is it just using the word, as many people feel comfortable with.  Through these open and honest conversations, I firmly believe we&rsquo;ll educate people and change their opinions one by one.</p>
<p>This is one of my goals at the <a title="API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference</a>.  At first glance it is easy to think the event might appear to be a corporate API lovefest, but let&rsquo;s scratch the surface a little bit:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Steve Klabnik</strong> - His keynote title is &ldquo;Why Open?&rdquo;&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Singly</strong> - I don&rsquo;t know anyone who cares more about open access to personal data than Singly&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Swagger</strong> - Tony and the gang are building amazing open source tools that facilitate API development</li>
<li><strong>Kirsten Jones</strong> - Kirsten&rsquo;s talk on educating owners and devs about HTTP is critical to the standard being used consistently across industry&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Temboo &amp; Webshell </strong>- These guys entire business rely upon open TOS allowing them to aggregate APIs and their existence provides real pressure for API owners to open up&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Hack Education</strong> - I&rsquo;m biased here.  But there is nobody in education working as tirelessly as my girlfriend Audrey Watters to open up data that is locked in education silos</li>
<li><strong>Donors Choose</strong> - An online charity that provides open data and APIs to make classrooms better&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Seabourne</strong> -  Seabourne has a suite of open source and open API products like Cumula that are transforming the government and making it more open and transparent</li>
<li><strong>Digital Strategy</strong> - I will be showcasing all the open tools, data and API initiatives across federal agencies--spearheaded by the GSA</li>
</ul>
<p>That is 10 out of 60 of the session and keynote speakers bringing open discussions to the table. &nbsp;There are also three panels that are purposefully designed to discuss open:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Building Great APIs: Do&rsquo;s and Don&rsquo;ts&nbsp;</li>
<li>API Business Models&nbsp;</li>
<li>APIs Platforms and Business Model Tradeoffs</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see there will be plenty of "open" discussions at API Strategy &amp; Practice--I&rsquo;m sure I could extract more if I had time.&nbsp;I would love to be able to have a perfectly open API industry and perfectly open API event, where everyone agreed on what open was, widely used open standards and came together to truly make the industry the best it can be.  But it doesn&rsquo;t exist.  We have to create it incrementally.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/index.php"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/api-strategy-practice-conference/api-strategy-home-1.png" alt="" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>API Strategy &amp; Practice took corporate sponsorship to make sure everyone has an event to come to.  Then we got to work bringing together the best minds (yes some corporate running closed APIs), to work together and discuss all the issues across a multitude of industries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m 100% dedicated to the concept "open".  I don&rsquo;t work for any corporation, I&rsquo;m 100% independent so that I can have the loudest, most unrestrained voice possible. And I am dedicated&nbsp;to making sure the event is about the community, ideas, strategy and real discussions about the toughest challenges we face in the space.</p>
<p>If you aren&rsquo;t there, participating in these discussions, I&rsquo;m afraid we are losing an important voice, and that is a lost opportunity.  So please contact me if you wish to be there.  I will make sure you get in. &nbsp;Otherwise, you will miss your chance to convince some of the folks who might not see open, in the same way you do.</p>

<p>I finished updating the <a title="speaker linup" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/speakers.php">speaker lineup</a> for the <a title="API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference</a> this weekend.  While we still have a couple of panels to finalize and keynotes to announce, the speaker lineup is almost final.</p>
<p>We have spent almost 8 weeks reaching out to leaders across the API industry, soliciting submissions for keynotes, panels and sessions.  It has been a lot of fun taking all the submissions and crafting the most compelling schedule as possible.</p>
<p>It was really important to me that we didn&rsquo;t just&nbsp;discuss the common areas of the API industry, like service providers, REST, etc.  Not that these aren&rsquo;t relevant--they are!  But I wanted to make sure we discuss some areas that are critical to the space, but do not get much airtime.  Topics like API design and API life-cycle methodologies.</p>
<p>I feel it is also critical to discuss where we are going, by covering topics like API automation, aggregation and building of programming frameworks on top of numerous APIs--trends that will allow us leap forward in how we consume and build apps on top of APIs.</p>
<p>In the next two weeks I will be going through our lineup in detail and talking about the various API session tracks like music, social, payments, government and education to name a few prominent session areas.</p>
<p><a title="API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/api-strategy-practice-conference/api-strategy-home-1.png" alt="" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>While I started getting excited about this event back in August, it is really starting to get real.  I&rsquo;m really psyched about how this event has come together.  There will only be 250-300 people at the event, so it&rsquo;s going to be a very intimate opportunity for network with these API industry leaders.</p>
<p>Make sure and <a title="register for the API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/register.php">register for the API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference</a> ASAP, and I look forward to seeing you there.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Oct 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/healthy-developers/Jeremia-Kimelman.jpeg" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></p>
<p>As part of my research into how to create <a title="Healthy Developer communities" href="http://kinlane.com/blog/tag.php?Search_Tag=HealthyDevs">healthy developer communities</a>, I've been spending time reaching out to organizers of developer meetups in different cities so I can get some insight into what it takes to successfully organize and run a developer meetup.</p>
<p>I recently spoke to Jeremia Kimelman (<a href="https://twitter.com/jeremiak">@jeremiak</a>)&nbsp;of <a title="Tout" href="http://www.tout.com/">Tout</a>, who runs <a title="Mobile Developer Mondays" href="http://www.meetup.com/momolabs/">Mobile Monday Developers</a>. Jeremia took over the Mobile Monday Developers with the idea that he would create a meet up format where tech companies could reach out to developers in a non-spammy way.  Companies could sponsor workshops and come in to deliver on topics like HTML5 or HTML5 vs Native Apps, and do it in a way that would add value to developers worlds.</p>
<p>This is a model that I'm sure many tech companies would drool over, and very often view meetups as a perfect medium for this type of sales pitch.  As I reach out to meet up organizers I get the vibe that many of them already get solicited by companies in this fashion--either because they don't respond at all, or by being somewhat hostile to my questions about their meetup.</p>
<p><a title="Tout" href="http://www.tout.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/healthy-developers/Tout.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Jeremia was able to grow his meet ups from about 40 to 140 members with this model, but when I asked him if this was a model that could be replicated, he replied, "definitely not".  It doesn't create value. It doesn't solve the problems developers face and ultimately will doom your meetup to failure.</p>
<p>As platform and API owners it's easy to drink our own kool-aid and think what we are offering is what developers want.  Jeremia said it's easy to project your business understanding onto developers, and assume they are concerned with things like monetization and in-app payments, when in reality these things might be the furthest thing from their minds.</p>
<p>In an effort to truly deliver value to developers, Jeremia decided to pivot, working to better understand better how to make it a community owned event. By actually solving the problems developers face, making the event truly about learning and growth--not about what we perceive developers will need, and our products.</p>
<p>Not all developers are created equal.  iPhone developers won't see things the same way as Android devs, and Windows mobile developers are going to have way different needs than others.  "Don't try to be everything to everyone", said Jeremia.</p>
<p><a title="Meetups" href="http://www.meetup.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/meetup/meetup_logo.gif" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>To make it about developers and to introduce community into the meetup he is playing around with letting attendees share the problems they personally face as developers, letting the group openly discuss the problem, provide solutions and help each other learn and grow.  This has the potential to bring value and community to the meetup in an organic way, not something that is imposed by him or a company.</p>
<p>As API or platform evangelists I think it's easy to be self-centered, making hackathons and meet ups all about us. &nbsp;When in reality we should be actively working to just support developers as they are. &nbsp;We need to work with them to understand the problems they face, and help them find solutions--even if the solutions are not our products and services.</p>
<p>In the end, if the developers are successful and we helped them get there.  It will go a long way in building trust, something that can't be established when just evangelizing or selling our company to developers at meetups around the country.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Oct 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/federal-government/innovation-fellows/PresidentialInnovationFellows.jpeg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was honored this month to receive an invitation from Todd Park (<a title="Todd Park" href="https://twitter.com/todd_park">@todd_park</a>), the U.S. Chief Technology Officer, on behalf of the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/innovationfellows">Presidential Innovation Fellows Program</a>, to come out to Washington DC and spend an afternoon coaching and working with some of the Presidential Innovation Fellows on the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/innovationfellows/opendata">Open Data Initiatives</a> project.</p>
<p>The Presidential Innovation Fellows program brings together top innovators from the private&nbsp;sector, nonprofits, and academia with top innovators in government to collaborate on solutions that aim to deliver significant results in six months, while being supported by a broader community of interested citizens throughout the country.</p>
<p>The objective of the OpenData Initiatives are centered around:</p>
<blockquote><em>Stimulating a rising tide of innovation and entrepreneurship that utilizes government data to create tools that help Americans in numerous ways</em></blockquote>
<p>Working with the Innovation Fellows is just one areas I&rsquo;m <a title="working to change the way our government works using APIs" href="/federal_government.php">working to change the way our government works using APIs</a>.  I strongly feel that opening up our government, and evolving how it operates using web APIs is fundamental in bringing democracy into the 21st century.</p>
<p>While speaking with the Innovation Fellows I will cover the usual material I have published here on API Evangelist:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="History of APIs" href="/blog/tag.php?Search_Tag=History">History of APIs</a></strong> - Brief overview of the modern web API movement</li>
<li><strong><a title="API Building Blocks" href="/buildingblocks/">API Building Blocks</a> </strong>- The essential building blocks to a successful API</li>
<li><strong><a title="Service Providers" href="/serviceproviders/">API Service Providers</a></strong> - Roundup of the service providers who can help deploy APIs</li>
<li><strong><a title="API Tools" href="/apitools/">API Tools</a></strong> - Pull together list of tools that can be used to design, deploy and manage APIs</li>
<li><strong><a title="API Industries" href="/industries/">Industries</a></strong> - Some of the top industries putting APIs to use</li>
<li><strong><a title="Hackathons" href="http://hackweekends.com/">Hackathons</a></strong> - How hackathons are being used to drive innovation</li>
</ul>
<p>My intentions are to help share everything I know with the fellows to make sure they are well equipped to execute as part of the OpenData Initiatives.  APIs will be the underlying technology that stimulates innovation and the interface that allows Americans to develop tools that utilizes government data.</p>
<p>APIs won&rsquo;t just be the underlying technology that drives this, the philosophies and methodologies that have fueled the current web API movement will be essential in changing culture in washington.  APIs have the potential to allow federal agencies to take inventory of the rich data and content they posses, and open up government, making their day to day operations much more public, and a truly participatory process.</p>
<p>This process won&rsquo;t be giving the folks who run our government another thing to learn or do, it will allow them share much of heavy lifting associated with day to day operations with the public, corporations and nonprofits--leaving them much more nimble to accomplish their core mission.  APIs aren&rsquo;t just about technology change, they are about cultural change, and have the potential to be the change we want to see in washington.</p>
<p>As I prepare my thoughts to go out to DC I wanted to put it out to my readers and see what you feel I should share with the Innovation Fellows about the API space.  What do they need to know to make their six month iniatives as impactful as possible?  How can I best distill down everything we&rsquo;ve learned in the public space about openness, transparency and developer ecosystems, so they get the true essence of this movement?</p>

<span>We saw major enhancements coming down the pipes with IOS 5 and Mac OS X Lion. What really stood out was their new <a title="iCloud" href="http://www.apple.com/icloud/">iCloud</a>.</span><p></p>
<span>iCloud is free, seamless storage in the cloud for documents and everything else you use on your Mac and IOS devices.</span><p></p>
<span>This means documents you've written, presentations you've prepared are available on any IOS device. You can view and edit the same document, in its latest state, on all your devices. And since iCloud automatically updates any changes you make, you don't even have to remember to save your work. </span><p></p>
<span>iCloud will also have a full set of APIs for developers to take advantage of, allowing them to implement iCloud storage, sync, and backup for documents into any application.</span><p></p>
<span>Apple's iCloud represents a continued evolution of the file system from being local to existing on the Internet and available on any device. This means that all design, collaboration, publishing and printing will move off the desktop as well. </span><p></p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/10/12/the-api-evangelist-mission/">The API Evangelist Mission</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">12 Oct 2012</span>
        <p><a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/api-evangelist-logo-400.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Many folks who encounter <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> think I'm working to evangelize a single API. &nbsp;I field so many questions about this I thought I would address by publishing an API Evangelist mission statement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The mission of API Evangelist is to educate business, nonprofit and government leaders about the value of APIs to their organizations.</p>
<p>API Evangelist is made up of four properties:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>API Evangelist </strong>(<a href="http://apievangelist.com">apievangelist.com</a>) - Business of APIs</li>
<li><strong>API Voice</strong> (<a href="http://apivoice.com">apivoice.com</a>) - Politics of APIs</li>
<li><strong>API Stack</strong> (<a href="http://theapistack.com">theapistack.com</a>) - API discovery and ranking </li>
<li><strong>Hack Weekends</strong> (<a href="http://hackweekends.com">hackweekends.com</a>) - Hackathon news and calendar</li>
</ul>
<p>With API Evangelist I strive to be the independent voice for the industry, providing the public with information about API:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a title="API Building Blocks" href="/buildingblocks/">Building Blocks</a></li>
<li><a title="API Service Providers" href="/serviceproviders/">Service Providers</a></li>
<li><a title="API Industries" href="/industries/">Industries</a></li>
<li><a title="API Tools" href="/apitools/">Tools</a></li>
<li><a title="API News" href="/news/">News</a></li>
<li><a title="API Analysis" href="/blog/">Analysis</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The goal is to provide a wealth of resources for those looking to design, develop and deploy APIs without bias towards a specific platform--allowing them to make an educated choice about what path they should take.</p>
<p>To stay independent and operate API Evangelist, I need to bring in revenue, and keep things moving forward.  I strive to do this in as healthy of a way as possible, without giving away control over my attention and focus, and contribute as much as possible to resources I provide to the public.</p>
<p>Areas I currently offer consulting services in are:</p>
<p><strong>Strategy</strong></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>API Evangelism</strong> - Design and oversight of companies API evangelism efforts</li>
<li><strong>Monetization Strategy</strong> - Design and oversight of a companies API monetization, business model and incubation approaches</li>
<li><strong>Hackathons</strong> - Targeting, planning and execution of hackathons</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Research</strong></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Industry</strong> - Analysis of specific industries, API providers within and the opportunities available</li>
<li><strong>Markets</strong> - Identifying and deeper understanding of evangelism opportunities within specific cities and countries</li>
<li><strong>Developer Profiling</strong> - Targeting and profiling of developers within industries, markets and of specific, existing APIs</li>
<li><strong>Providers</strong> - Providing a deeper understanding of how specific APIs operate their API operations</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Speaking</strong></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Webinars</strong> - Participating in webinars with companies and individuals</li>
<li><strong>Conferences</strong> - Speaking and presenting at technology conferences</li>
<li><strong>Meetups</strong> - Speaking and participating at local meetups</li>
<li><strong>Workshops</strong> - Design and execution of workshops at existing events</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these consulting areas are design to provide as much value to the client, while amplifying the signal and content via the four API Evangelist properties, and other syndication opportunities, under a <a title="Creative Commons License" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">creative commons license</a>--enabling the public to consume and provide the greatest possible good for the API industry.</p>
<p>I feel strongly that a wealth of open resources will help ensure a fast growing and healthy industry by educating non-developers, non-technical business leaders about the benefits of APIs and healthy developer and partner ecosystem.</p>
<p>Please let me know how you can help support me in what I do, providing the industry with the information it needs to be successful, while also giving you what you need to successfully provide the services you offer.</p>
<p>This <a href="http://kinlane.com/mission.php">mission statement is a permanent fixture on my central kinlane.com site</a>, it''s not just the API Evangelist mission, it is my mission.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Oct 2012</span>
        <p><a title="NPR" href="http://www.npr.org/"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/npr/npr-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>NPR is defining new models for content distribution. One that other media providers can follow, when designing their API driven content delivery platforms.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://dev.npr.org/">NPR Story API</a> provides digital access to NPR content and to other station content--allowing both NPR and stations to contribute and consume local and national news stories.</p>
<p>In an effort to provide NPR stations with more control over the content they contribute to the platform for distribution, <a href="http://digitalservices.npr.org/post/npr-api-content-permissions-control">NPR Digital Services has introduced content permissions control via the NPR story API</a>.</p>
<p>Currently content stored on the  Story API&rsquo;s platform can be retrieved by anyone with an API key--allowing content pushed across the network to be consumedd in 3 ways:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Create Once, Publish Everywhere</strong> - Stations and npr.org push content into the API and then pull the content onto other platforms, such as other station-owned web properties and mobile apps</li>
<li><strong>Station Networks</strong> - Content is shared between multiple stations in a content network, both on web sites and mobile apps</li>
<li><strong>National</strong> - Station content is featured on npr.org and NPR mobile apps with links back to station digital properties</li>
</ul>
<p>Using the new content permissions, stations can now control who is allowed to pull their content from the API.  The permissions work by allowing stations pushing content to specify whether the content should be:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Public to all</li>
<li>Public to the NPR station network</li>
<li>Public to a group of stations listed in a whitelist </li>
<li>Public to everyone except for stations on a blacklist</li>
</ul>
<p>The new changes allow stations to set these permissions at the individual story level, as well as create permission groups to add multiple stories to.</p>
<p>NPR's approach is a great model for how APIs can facilitate content exchange across a large network of providers, allowing for the widest distribution possible-while also allowing content owners control over who has access to their valuable content in a very granular way.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/npr/NPR-Digital-Services.png" alt="" width="450" /></p>
<p>APIs are all about providing access to valuable content and resources, but should also be designed to give the proper amount of access, so your content doesn&rsquo;t end up being consumed, distributed in ways you don&rsquo;t find appropriate.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Oct 2012</span>

<p>Marketing to developers is no straightforward task, and with the growth in the number of APIs, platforms, tools and active evangelists and advocates, it is only going to get harder.</p>
<p>Developers just don&rsquo;t want to be sold anything.  We just want to do what we do, and just be left alone--until we need help and reach out.  Then we need you to be there.</p>
<p>With <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> I&rsquo;m evangelizing the importance of APIs to a wider audience beyond developers, while also helping companies understand how they can market their services to developers.</p>
<p>Helping non-developers understand about APIs is getting easier each month, while helping API owners market to developers is getting harder.</p>
<p>Many companies are even opting to not use the term advocate or evangelist, as these names are beginning to have a negative impression with developers.</p>
<p>Developers are bombarded by one or many evangelists, everywhere they go, and many of these evangelists are more sales and marketing than developer support--giving everyone a bad name.</p>
<p>If you are looking to evangelize your API in the near future, deeply consider your approach.  Your objective is not to sell developers on your API, but to help them be successful in what they are doing--something that may or may not involve your companies API.</p>
<p>Your only option for evangelism is to be as authentic as possible and truly solve the problems developers face, otherwise developers will look elsewhere--and with the increased competition, developers have a growing number of options when it comes to APIs and platforms to get the job done.</p>

<p>Chris and I will be exploring a couple are of specific areas, regarding the business of APIs:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Emerging API economy and digital business ecosystems</li>
<li>How to assemble the building blocks of a successful API</li>
<li>When a complete open source API management platform delivers business value</li>
<li>Future trends in maximizing the value of APIs</li>
</ul>
<p>WSO2 brings a wealth of API experience to the table and I look forward to exploring these areas with Chris.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/10/06/github-is-the-social-network-of-the-future/">Github is the Social Network of the Future</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">06 Oct 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/github/github-logo-transparent.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>There is a lot of news about social networks in the last couple of weeks, with <a href="http://go.bloomberg.com/tech-blog/2012-10-04-facebook-grows-to-1-billion-users-creates-video-to-show-global-reach/">Facebook reaching 1B users</a>, a <a href="http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/myspace_gets_new_look_stays_true_to_its_roots">brand new look for MySpace</a> giving people hope for the struggling social network, the <a title="great twitter migration to app.net" href="http://apivoice.com/2012/10/04/has-the-great-twitter-migration-to-app.net-begun/">great Twitter migration to App.net</a> and what a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/technology/dick-costolo-of-twitter-an-improv-master-writing-its-script.html">master of improv Dick Costolo is, writing Twitters script</a>.</p>
<p>All of these news items are in some way trying to convince us of what the future of social networking will look like, declaring Twitter, Facebook, MySpace and App.net as a contender.  While all of these social networks aren&rsquo;t going anywhere, I think there is one social network that represents the future of all social networks--<a title="Github" href="https://github.com/">Github</a>.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know what Github is, you probably aren&rsquo;t a programmer.  Github is a social network built around the software version control software <a title="Git" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)">Git</a>. &nbsp;Using Github, programmers can collaborate around repositories of code, which allows them to download, fork and commit back code in any format--making software development a social endeavor amongst potentially thousands of developers.</p>
<p>While Github is primarily a social network of programmers, repositories don&rsquo;t have to be just code.  Github repositories can contain HTML, text files and many other formats that can be edited by anybody--allowing the power of version control and collaboration to occur between anyone, in any business sector.</p>
<p>I just finished watching <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/en/clay_shirky_how_the_internet_will_one_day_transform_government.html">Clay Shirky&rsquo;s talk on how the Internet will (one day) transform government</a>, using the platform to deal with a flood of new, often times divergent, ideas.  As always, Clay masterfully uses history to lay the groundwork for his argument, that social collaboration and version control with Github is in alignment with how democracy should work.</p>
<p>While Twitter and Facebook have proven to evoke profound social change, I think Github holds amazing potential for change as well. And whether it is allowing developers to build open source software, government to make the legal process truly inclusive of its citizens or <a title="empowering teachers to collaborate on curriculum with Github" href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/07/16/github-for-education-revisited/">empowering our teachers to collaborate on classroom curriculum</a>--Github holds an amazing amount of untapped potential.</p>
<p>Github opens up unlimited possibilities for much more constructive and meaningful social interactions than we&rsquo;ve seen with Twitter and Facebook. &nbsp;Social interactions that will allow anyone to benefit from the successful aspects of open source software development--unleasing a new era of social networking and collaboration.</p>

<p>Hackathons are a popular way for developers to come together and hack on mobile and web apps, in hopes of winning prizes and getting noticed for their innovation.  Silicon Valley has done a great job of keeping hackathons about building apps, but there are many other ways to apply the hackathon model.</p>
<p>One hackathon model that I&rsquo;ve seen a couple times now, is more about hacking a process, rather than hacking an app.  A hackathon where any company, organization or individual can come, with their existing process, and walk participants through what they are looking to accomplish--with the goal of making it better.</p>
<p>The process could be anything they already do on a regular basis and are looking to optimize, or a new process they would like to develop. In our ever-increasing digital world, where Software as a Service (SaaS) and APIs are becoming commonplace in our daily lives, there is an need for constantly identifying, refining and establishing new processes.</p>
<p>APIs open up huge opportunities for more efficient ways of getting things done, and a hackathon is a great way to pitch a process to a bunch of new users, form teams and spend some time hacking together a more efficient way to get it done.  The objective of this form of the hackathon is to refine a process and help make it better, using technology to better solve the problems we deal with every day.</p>
<p>While building apps is a great focus of a hackathon, they might be better used to help people gain efficiencies at their companies and organizations--allowing them to get access to creative new approaches, and knowledge about other potential tools and platforms they can put to use. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I predict hackathons will continue to grow in popularity, and hopefully we can continue to evolve them to reach the widest possible audience. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The Tumblr engineering team has been hard at work on a new Github page, showcasing the <a href="http://tumblr.github.com/#code">open source projects they've released</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Tumblr has also added a <a href="http://tumblr.github.com/#coming-soon">coming soon section,</a> highlighting open source projects they are planning on releasing in the near future.</p>
<p>What's interesting is they have also included <a href="http://tumblr.github.com/#presentations">select presentations from conferences and events Tumblr has presented at</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="http://tumblr.github.com/">Github implementation by Tumblr</a> is pretty unique, and to go even further, Tumblr has also&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/tumblr/tumblr.github.com">open sourced their whole approach to deploying it on Github</a>.</p>
<p><a title="Github" href="https://github.com/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/github/github-logo.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Tumblr's use of Github is worth showcasing. &nbsp;I think it's an innovative approach that other API owners could follow to showcase the open source project they are working on, as well as valuable event presentations.</p>
<p>I'm really impressed with the number of innovative uses of <a title="Github" href="https://github.com/">Github</a> I'm seeing lately.</p>

<p>When it comes to any business, you want to showcase your team, and the value they bring to the table. &nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the things I do here at <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, is showcase great examples of technology across the API industry. &nbsp;</p>
<p>With this in mind I wanted to showcase the <a title="Singly Team Page" href="https://singly.com/about">Singly team page.</a> &nbsp;When you visit singly.com and click on team in the footer, you get immediately see a team member photo carousel:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/singly/team/Singly-Team-Carousel.png" alt="" width="500" /></p>
<p>Which isn't very unique, but next you get 3 things that are unique:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Average number of hours each Singly team member slept this week</li>
<li>Number of Github commits in the last 7 days</li>
<li>Distance walked by Singly team members</li>
</ul>

<p>Singly team members provide this data using Quantified Self (QS) data from products like <a title="Fithbit" href="https://singly.com/docs/fitbit">Fitbit</a> and <a title="Runkeeper" href="https://singly.com/docs/runkeeper">Runkeeper</a>, and social programming networks like <a title="Github" href="https://singly.com/docs/github">Github</a>--driven by APIs. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Next Singly shows a map of their neighborhood in the San Francisco mission district:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/singly/team/Singly-Neighborhood.png" alt="" width="500" /></p>
<p>Then they wrap up with <a title="Instagram" href="https://singly.com/docs/instagram">Instagram</a> photos from team members:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/singly/team/Singly-Team-Instagram.png" alt="" width="500" /></p>
<p>The Singly team page is the best company team page I have ever seen. &nbsp;It shows extremely personal data from their Fitbit and Rukneeper devices, as well as the day to day business of code pushes via their Github accounts. The team page also shows you where the team is located and some Instagram photos to help you get the vibe of the team.</p>
<p>What does your website team page tell about your companies team?</p>

<p>When you spend a lot of time going to conferences, hackathons and events, you start really getting picky about which events you go to. To disrupt my regular routine, I need an event that will always add value to my professional career, but also be a good time!</p>
<p>When it comes to the latest in Internet technolgy, I always make time each year for the Gluecon and Defrag conferences. <a title="Gluecon" href="http://gluecon.com/2012/">Gluecon</a> is usually in the spring and <a title="Defrag" href="http://www.defragcon.com/2012/">Defrag</a> is in the fall--both occurring at the Omni Interlocken in Broomfield, CO.</p>
<p><a title="Defrag Confernece" href="http://www.defragcon.com/2012/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/defrag-2012/Defrag-2012-Conference.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.defragcon.com/2012/">Defrag is coming up November 15th and 16th</a>--right after November 1st and 2nd for the&nbsp;<a title="API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/index.php">API Strategy &amp; Practice in NYC.</a></p>
<p>API Strategy &amp; Conference is psyched to be partnering with Defrag in our first year.  If you <a title="Register for API strategy" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/register.php">register for API Strategy &amp; Conference</a>, you will get 10% off of your registration for Defrag.</p>
<p>The event combination will make November a great time to immerse yourself in the API industry, with API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference, then two weeks later, go further with Internet technology discussions at Defrag.</p>
<p>I look forward to seeing you at both <a title="API Strategy &amp; Practice" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/register.php">API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference</a> and <a title="Defrag" href="http://www.defragcon.com/2012/">Defrag</a> in November!&nbsp;</p>

        <p><a title="Github" href="http://www.github.com">Github</a> should be the center of your API operations, with the most obvious use being for SDK repositories, but Github offers a lot of other valuable tools that you can use to help manage your API platform.</p>
<p>One great use of Github is as an <a title="API issue management" href="/buildingblocks/ticket_system.php">API issue management</a> tool. &nbsp;The Github issue management system allows you to easily accept issue reports from your API community and apply labels to organize them into appropriate categories.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Singly/API/issues" target="_blank"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/github/Issue-Management-Github.png" alt="" width="525" /></a></p>
<p>To setup Github Issue Management for your API, just create a new repository, but you won't actually being pushing any code, you will just be using it as a container for running issue management. &nbsp;Think of it as repository for your API itself.</p>
<p>Once setup, you can link the issue management page directly from your API area, allowing users to actively submit issues, comment and potentialy be part of the API product development cycle.</p>
<p>Along with API Issue Management with Github, you can link issues with the milestones portion of Github, providing deeper roadmap integration, but I will cover that in a separate post.</p>

<p>Back in May, when the <span>White House CIO has released a strategy, entitled "</span><a title="Digital Government: Building a 21st Century Platform to Better Serve the American People" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-government-strategy.pdf">Digital Government: Building a 21st Century Platform to Better Serve the American People</a><span>", which directs all federal agencies to publish HTML, JSON and XML versions of their digital strategy, I wrote a PHP script to monitor the progress.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>To date, 25 federal agencies have successfully published their digital strategy, and I have been updating my script regularly to keep up. And while a few of the agencies still have querks with their HTTP Codes and with JSON formatting, the code is starting to stabilize. &nbsp;So I decided to start <a title="Publishing to Github" href="https://github.com/kinlane/digital-strategy">sharing it on Github</a>, allowing others to put it to use.</p>
<p>The first sample script I'm publishing is a <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/digital-strategy/blob/master/pull-agency.php">basic example of how to pull the JSON version of a single agencies digital strategy</a>. &nbsp;Once it pulls the JSON, it then loops through each item and field on the strategy, and renders to screen. &nbsp;It doesn't make any assumptions on what you wish to do with data.</p>
<p>Next I will publish a more sophisticated version that stores values in a database. &nbsp;Here is the pull federal agency digital strategy PHP script:</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently processing several discussion I&rsquo;ve had with folks about APIs and the future of search when it comes to voice enabled apps, like <a title="Apples Siri" href="http://www.apple.com/ios/siri/">Apple&rsquo;s Siri.</a></p>
<p>It started with a discussion with the <a title="Webshell" href="http://webshell.io/home">Webshell</a> folks about their blog post, <a title="Webservices supply chain management : the SIRI case" href="http://api500.com/post/27440326130/webservices-supply-chain-management-the-siri-case">Webservices supply chain management : the SIRI case</a>.  Next I was reading a presentation from Pat Cappelaere(<a href="https://twitter.com/cappelaere">@cappelaere</a>) CEO of <a title="Vightel Corporation" href="http://projects.washingtonpost.com/top-secret-america/companies/vightel-corporation/">Vightel Corporation</a>. called <a title="Building Tomorrow&rsquo;s Web Services API" href="http://www.slideshare.net/cappelaere/building-tomorrows-web-services">Building Tomorrow&rsquo;s Web Services API</a>.</p>
<p>Pat has an interesting image in his deck, showing who the next generation consumer of your API will be:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/siri/Siri-API-Search.png" alt="" width="525" /></p>
<p>These conversations reflect a whole new area of consideration for the future of web APIs.  Will voice be the dominant way to search via our mobile devices?  If so, how do we expose our companies resources, in a way that makes them easily consumed by voice enabled apps?</p>
<p>At the simplest, we need to discuss where REST fails us in this scenario, and at the most complex we need to discuss what &ldquo;activities&rdquo; will be consumed by voice apps and what types of &ldquo;supply chain management&rdquo; processes or framework will we need to manage all of this.</p>
<p>All of this will feed into to whether or not your company, its products and services will be found in a Siri-like search, when voice enabled apps become the default.</p>

        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/charts-graphs-1.png" alt="" align="right" /></p>
<p>When you have an API, you track two things:  1)  Number of Developer Registrations and 2)  Number of API requests.  This is how we determine a successful API, right?</p>
<p>You should track those two things, but those metrics alone do not define a successful API.  You should go much further.  Each API owner will have their own definition of success, thus their own set of metrics to measure success.</p>
<p>With this in mind, there is no single framework for measuring your API, but here is one suggestion for a basic framework to think about when tracking your API developers.</p>
<p>First establish some buckets to put users in:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>New</strong> - Brand new developer</li>
<li><strong>Active</strong> - Developer actively using API (come up with number)</li>
<li><strong>Inactive</strong> - Developers who go below the "active" number threshold for X number of days</li>
<li><strong>Billable</strong> - Developer who is paying you $$</li>
<li><strong>Partner</strong> - A developer who are working closer with than rest of developers</li>
<li><strong>Internal</strong> - Your staff or contractors who actively use your API, even for testing</li>
</ul>
<p>Then make sure and flag each user with a timestmap when they change status:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>5/2/2012 - New</li>
<li>5/2/2012 - Active</li>
<li>7/9/2012 - Billable</li>

<p>I like to generate daily, weekly and monthly counts for each bucket, plus see numbers on the churn between buckets.</p>
<p>Looking at developers in buckets, and tracking on their transitions between buckets allows you to start seeing the big picture, when large groups of users are migrating between status, or the individual picture, like why a single developer just went inactive.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see much to learn from just watching new registrations and number of API calls, but by creating meaningful buckets to place developers in, then understanding their evolution between these buckets, I think you can learn a lot with a pretty simple set of metrics.</p>

        <span class="post-date">18 Sep 2012</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.wordnik.com/" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/wordnik/wordnik-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>We all have our own approaches to API design and development, many of which will never see the light of day.  In the API space we hear a lot about API management and API success stories, but not much about the process of designing, developing and initial deployment of APIs.  I just had a little taste of how the <a href="http://www.wordnik.com/" target="_blank">Wordnik</a> team approaches it, using <a href="http://swagger.wordnik.com/" target="_blank">Swagger</a>.</p>
<p>Often when you hear about Swagger in the industry, you hear about the UI portion.  You know the sexy <a title="interactive documentation" href="http://apievangelist.com/buildingblocks/interactive_documentation.php">interactive documentation</a> that is fast becoming a standard with APIs, but it&rsquo;s just the tip of the iceberg--there is a whole lot more power to Swagger, than just interactive docs.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&ldquo;The heart of Swagger is the specification, and from that, cool shit can get done!&rdquo;,  say Tony Tam Wordnik CEO and technical co-founder.</em></p>
<p>To demonstrate, Tony walked me through Wordnik&rsquo;s approach to designing, developming and deploying a new API driven iPad app, using a team of 3:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>One person driving an editor writing JSON files, which are the Swagger spec for the needed API</li>
<li>The all three discussed the operations, parameters, while adding them to the JSON, and re-running the swagger spec validator after each meaningful change</li>
<li>When they were happy with the specs, they loaded the JSON files into the UI through  apache installed on a local machine</li>
<li>After they inspected each API and operation again, they wrote the models in the spec files, and reviewed again to make sure everything was good</li>
<li>Then they ran the Swagger Codegen and generated a Scalatra (Scala) server from the spec files</li>
<li>Then they ran the Swagger Codegen and generated an Objective-C client from the spec files</li>
<li>The server developer went off and wired the server to the business logic</li>
<li>The front-end guy went and wired the UI to the objective-c library</li>
</ul>
<p>The process took 2.5 hours in total, from API to interface--a technique they call interface-driven development, which focuses on modeling the perfect interface for the problem they are trying to solve using an API.</p>
<p><a href="http://swagger.wordnik.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/wordnik/Swagger-Logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>To solve this particular problem, they needed a scala server for the back-end.  they could have just as easily generated a Node.JS server, a Rails Sinatra server or any other based upon simple <a title="mustache templates" href="http://mustache.github.com/">mustache templates</a>. Additionally they could generate JavaScript, Scala, PHP or Python clients, but for this project they only needed Objective-C.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.wordnik.com/" target="_blank">Wordnik</a> approach to API design and development using <a href="http://swagger.wordnik.com/" target="_blank">Swagger</a> is interesting.  For me, it demonstrates that a clean API spec should not be an afterthought, and a means by which you generate interactive API documentation, or when API discovery becomes an issue.  Your entire design, development and management process should center around a meaningful API spec, which will then allow you to deploy your API server, interactive documentation, client code, while also providing API discovery.</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Sep 2012</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/youtube/Youtube-Stack-Overflow.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>YouTube has decided to <a href="http://apiblog.youtube.com/2012/09/the-youtube-api-on-stack-overflow.html">cease support for Youtube API QA via dedicated Google Group, and exclusively use Stack Overflow</a> for developer QA support.</p>
<p>Every developer knows that <a title="Stack Overflow" href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> is where you go to get the best answers for your programming issues, and API providers are taking notice too.</p>
<p>Stack Overflow has always been something I recommend paying attention to for any API evangelist, but more API providers are considering it be the place where all API developer QA should exist.</p>
<p><a title="Facebook" href="https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/545/">Facebook</a>, <a title="Foursquare" href="https://developer.foursquare.com/overview/support">Foursquare</a>, and <a title="Salesforce" href="http://blogs.developerforce.com/developer-relations/2012/08/now-in-public-beta-the-salesforce-stackexchange-qa-site.html">Salesforce</a> have all moved their API developer QA to Stack Overflow.</p>
<p>These API providers are still maintaining other API <a title="api support building blocks" href="/buildingblocks/">support building blocks</a> like <a title="bug ticket systems" href="/buildingblocks/ticket_system.php">bug ticket systems</a>, email and <a title="Twitter" href="/buildingblocks/twitter.php">Twitter</a> accounts, but when it comes to public developer forums they feel that Stack Overflow is enough.</p>
<p>While I think having a active presence on <a title="Stack Overflow" href="/buildingblocks/stack_exchange.php">Stack Overflow</a>&nbsp;is a critical part of any API evangelism strategy, I&rsquo;m not 100% sure eliminating a dedicated forum is the right way to go.  I worry you will push developer community completely out on the open Internet, reducing interactions that happen under your brand.</p>
<p>With the size of their developer community, larger APIs often have canyon that exists between them and their developers, and it&rsquo;s easy to widen this canyon by moving general QA exclusively into an open Internet forum.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that much more work to monitor and respond to your community forum as well as Stack Overflow, and even add in Quora, Reddit, StumbleUpon, Google Alerts, and other ways of monitoring the API and developer landscape.</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Sep 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/quantified-self/quantified-self.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m immersing myself into the fascinating new world of the <a title="Quantified Self" href="http://quantifiedself.com/about/">Quantified Self</a> (QS).  If you are not familiar with what QS is, according to Wikipedia:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Quantified Self is a movement to incorporate technology into data acquisition on aspects of a person's daily life in terms of inputs (e.g. food consumed, quality of surrounding air), states (e.g. mood, arousal, blood oxygen levels), and performance (mental and physical).</em></p>
<p>As I do with other areas, I start my research by doing a roundup of companies who offer QS products and services--which helps me define the space. Within an hour I easily found 50+ QS device manufacturers, some of which were complete with API driven integration platforms-- way too many to list in a single roundup, but here are a couple of better known companies:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="Fitbit" href="http://www.fitbit.com/">Fitbit</a></strong> - Fitbit is a health and fitness tracking device</li>
<li><strong><a title="Runkeeper" href="http://runkeeper.com/">RunKeeper</a></strong> - Runkeeper is a device for tracking<span>, measuring, and improving your fitness</span></li>
<li><strong><a title="Withings" href="http://www.withings.com/">Withings</a></strong> - Withings provides connected body scales, blood pressure and baby monitors</li>
<li><strong><a title="Zeo" href="http://www.myzeo.com/sleep/">Zeo</a></strong> - Zeo has sleep tracking and management devices and apps</li>
</ul>
<p>These QS platforms represent a whole new opportunity for the API industry, one that will drive the next generation of healthcare innovation.  Self-quantification starts with data collection, followed by visualization, then cross-referencing and the discovery of correlations--all three opportunites for APIs.</p>
<p>Devices can use APIs via cell and wifi to transmit data for collection and storage, while also allowing app developers to use the same APIs to help end-users manage and visualize their data. Then, when appropriate, use the same APIs providing access to other systems and providers who can then cross-reference and discover correlations within individual or groups of users.</p>
<p>It is exciting to think about the possibilities around QS.  New ways to gather data about our health and the environment around us in real-time, but also be able to understand this data in the most meaningful way possible, in a way that impacts the most important thing to us--our health!</p>
<p><strong>Devices + APIs + Cloud = Exciting Opportunities!</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m stoked to announce that <a title="Steve Klabnik" href="http://www.steveklabnik.com/">Steve Klabnik</a> will be speaking at the <a title="API Strategy &amp; Practice" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/speakers.php">API Strategy &amp; Practice conference</a>, November 1st &amp; 2nd in New York City.  I just added him to the homepage and <a title="API Speakers" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/speakers.php">speaker line-up</a>.</p>
<p>Steve is a highly respected Ruby developer, software craftsman, and an aspiring digital humanities scholar. He spends most of his time contributing to Open Source projects, and maintains both <a title="Hackety Hack" href="http://hackety.com/">Hackety Hack</a> and <a title="Shoes" href="http://shoesrb.com/">Shoes</a>, while also teaching and helping develop curriculum for&nbsp;<a title="JumpStart Labs" href="http://www.jumpstartlab.com/">Jumpstart Lab</a>.</p>
<p>Steve has has written book on <a title="Designing Hypermedia APIs" href="http://designinghypermediaapis.com/">Designing Hypermedia APIs</a>. Well it&rsquo;s better than a book.  I&rsquo;d call it a "living digital book". One where you can constantly come back and get fresh content and interact with the books community and author.  Much better than  the old-school programming book, which you buy once and it sits on your shelf.</p>
<p>What intrigues me about Steve, is that his perspective is very technical, but in his own words, &ldquo;<em>I've found a place between the sciences and the humanities.</em>&rdquo;  Which is a point of view we need to give a platform to, and everyone in Silicon Valley needs to listen.</p>
<p>Steve is exactly the fresh perspective we want to get at the <a title="API Strategy &amp; Practice" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/speakers.php">API Strategy &amp; Practice conference</a>.  I hope you can join us for the two day event in November and be there in person for Steve&rsquo;s talk.</p>

<p>Albert combines over 10 years of entrepreneurial experience with an in-depth technology background. As an entrepreneur, he has founded or co-founded five companies, including a management consulting firm (in Germany), a hosted data analytics company, a technology subsidiary for Telebanc (now E*Tradebank), an early stage investment firm, and most recently (with his wife), DailyLit, a service for reading books by email or RSS.</p>
<p>Albert also served as the president of del.icio.us through the company's sale to Yahoo. His technology background goes back to winning the German national computer science competition at age 18. Albert graduated summa cum laude from Harvard College in economics and computer science and holds a Ph.D. in Information Technology from MIT. He has managed technology projects for organizations as diverse as Tacoda (startup) and Telebanc (leading Internet bank).</p>
<p>USV invests in companies that have large networks of engaged users, differentiated by user experience and defensible by network effects, so USV has a vested interest in understanding developer communities, how APIs will evolve, what types of businesses are best suited to an API driven strategy.</p>
<p>The <a title="API Strategy &amp; Practice" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Practice &amp; Strategy conference</a> fireside chat with Albert Wenger will reflect the tone of the conference, which is a blend of both the technical and business of APIs--providing what is essential for companies to be successful with their API driven strategies.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m updating the login and authentication for my content management system, APIs and other tools to provide authentication using Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and Github by default. I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://singly.com/">Singly as an authentication provider</a>, because their aggregation of API authentication, endpoints and objects across these providers is easy and most efficient way I know to get this accomplished.</p>
<p>In addition to it being easy, I&rsquo;m using Singly for another advantage.  Each service Singly provides has a discovery endpoint, which provides me with metadata and the other endpoints each service provides.  I want to use this meta data to derive a quick snapshot ranking of my authenticating user.</p>
<p>For example, when a user authenticates via <a href="https://github.com/">Github Using Singly</a>, I get the following meta data and endpoints:</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/singly/Singly-Github-Meta-Endpoints.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>Singly gives me 6 endpoints with data from the user&rsquo;s activity in these areas.  I&rsquo;m looking to create an algorithm that will provide me with some quick ranking score based upon the number of repositories, followers and following a user has.</p>
<p>Right now I'm just going to add these up, take average across all my users that have logged in via Github.  I&rsquo;m sure I will evolve the design of the algorithm as I progress, but it should work for now.</p>
<p>My goal is to provide a little more insight into what type of user is signing up for my service, API or otherwise and possibly take different courses of action based upon their overall activity levels on Github.  I mean, if they are Github superstar I want to know it, and also know if they aren&rsquo;t very active at all.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll explore the same algorithm for <a href="https://www.singly.com/docs/twitter">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.singly.com/docs/facebook">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.singly.com/docs/linkedin">LinkedIn</a> authentication, but probably take different values into consideration for those social networks.</p>

<p>I'm happy to be a media partner for the <a title="SOA Cloud 2012 Service Technology Symposium" href="http://www.servicetechsymposium.com/">SOA Cloud 2012 Service Technology Symposium</a>, the largest international conference dedicated to the exploration of SOA, cloud computing and modern service technologies.</p>
<p>SOA Cloud 2012 is happening September 24,25, 2012 in London, UK at the Imperial College London.  The first day kicks off with:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li> <strong><a title="The Era of Intelligent Service Technology" href="http://www.servicetechsymposium.com/agenda2012.php#keynote1">The Era of Intelligent Service Technology</a></strong> -  Thomas Erl's well-known, visionary tour of relationships between and combinations of service-oriented architecture, cloud computing, and semantic Web technologies. </li>
<li><a title="New Paradigms for Application Architecture" href="http://www.servicetechsymposium.com/agenda2012.php#keynote10">New Paradigms for Application Architecture</a>: From Applications to IT Services Speaker by Anne Thomas Manes of Gartner about the convergence of mobile, social, cloud, and information forcing demand that we adopt new paradigms for application architecture and delivery</li>
</ul>
<p>The first day keynotes have not one space agency talking APIs, but two.  With<a href="http://www.servicetechsymposium.com/agenda2012.php#keynote2"> Vicente Navarro of the European Space Agency</a>, and <a href="http://www.servicetechsymposium.com/agenda2012.php#keynote3">Hook Hua of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology</a> (NASA Center).</p>
<p>Second day keynotes are pretty impressive too, with opening keynote by Dennis Wisnosky, US Department of Defense &ndash; "<a href="http://www.servicetechsymposium.com/agenda2012.php#keynote6">Heading, Altitude &amp; Airspeed: Service Orientation, Cloud &amp; Semantics &ndash; All or Nothing!</a>".  Then Michael Hritz, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) &ndash; "<a href="http://www.servicetechsymposium.com/agenda2012.php#keynote7">SOA, Cloud and Service Technologies at the FAA</a>"  and "<a href="http://www.servicetechsymposium.com/agenda2012.php#keynote11">The API Economy is Here: Facebook, Twitter, Netflix and Your IT Enterprise</a>" from Corey Scobie of SOA Software looks interesting.</p>
<p>A couple sessions I&rsquo;m watching closely are:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://www.servicetechsymposium.com/agenda2012.php#the_open_api_economy">The Open API Economy: What Is It and How Do I Capitalize on It?</a> with Laura Olson of IBM</li>

</ul>
<p>Under the <a href="http://www.servicetechsymposium.com/panels2012.php">expert panels</a> the  The New World of Open APIs caught my eye, where they are discussing how the marketplace and economy that surround open APIs is rapidly growing, and has been further fueled by the acceptance of REST-based services and innovative hybrid solutions.</p>
<p>These are just a few of the keynotes, sessions and panel that caught my attention,  I&rsquo;m going to spend some time researching a couple of the speakers and companies and then I might have some more recommendations.  It looks like a lot of API goodness packed into 2 days, and would make a fun trip to London this month.</p>

<p>Today I noticed that NASA, in addition to publishing their digital strategy in <a title="NASA HTML Digital Strategy" href="http://www.nasa.gov/agency/digitalstrategy/index.html">HTML</a>, <a title="XML" href="http://www.nasa.gov/digitalstrategy.xml">XML</a> and <a title="NASA JSON Digital Strategy" href="http://www.nasa.gov/digitalstrategy.json">JSON</a>, added a "recent commits" Github widget on their digital strategy homepage.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a small, but very important addition.  It shows that NASA sees the importance of not just using Github, but pushing code and interacting with developers via the social network.</p>

<p>I was spending time thinking about API discovery methodologies this afternoon (I know...I have issues), but with <a title="ProgrammableWeb approaching 8K public APIs" href="http://www.programmableweb.com/">ProgrammableWeb approaching 8K public APIs</a>, its a very real problem.</p>
<p>Currently, as an application developer, when I have an idea, I start by sketching what I want to build and set out to find all of the resources I will need to make it a reality.  I pick my platform of choice and then set out to find other API resources I will need to bring my app to life.</p>
<p>I will need a database, user management and some analytics for my back-end, selecting a <a title="Backend as a Service" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/08/22/mobile-backend-as-a-service-roundup-and-the-future-of-web-apis/">Backend as a Service</a>&nbsp;(BaaS)&nbsp;provider like <a title="CloudMine" href="https://cloudmine.me/">CloudMine</a> or <a title="Kinvey" href="http://www.kinvey.com/">Kinvey</a>.  Next I need authentication and social integration with <a title="Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn using Singly" href="http://www.singly.com">Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn using Singly</a>.  After this I will have to piece together my application from a variety of individual APIs like <a title="Twilio" href="http://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a>, <a title="Urban Airship" href="http://urbanairship.com/">Urban Airship</a>, <a title="Iron.io" href="http://Iron.io">Iron.io</a> and many other APIs.</p>
<p>What if we flipped this on its head and reversed the process?  As an application developer, I could publish a list of resources I need for my web or mobile app, and APIs could find me.  I could just publish my need for image storage, facial recognition, location and other resources and API providers could find me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a brain exercise to see if I&rsquo;m missing anything.  Maybe the problem we need to solve isn&rsquo;t API discovery, it&rsquo;s application discovery? &nbsp;Enable APIs to find developers, in addition to developers finding APIs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Sep 2012</span>
        <p>I was directed to an API question today, that needs to be asked constantly in the space:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" style="padding-left: 50px;">
<p>What&rsquo;s your biggest web API pet peeve? What drives you crazy when integrating with a new API?</p>

<p>My response was:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" style="padding-left: 50px;">

<script src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
<p>This is such a relevant topic I wanted to continue the conversation by listing the top 10 things that drive me crazy when integrating with a new API:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Incomplete or Cumbersome Documentation</strong> - Definitely something that will keep you from a achieving a successful integration and make you walk away from an API</li>
<li><strong>Lacking Code Samples &amp; Libraries</strong> - The programming language i&rsquo;m using could vary from project to project, and the code samples and libraries can make or break my successful integration</li>
<li><strong>Senseless Rate Limiting</strong> - Rate limits are an essential part of API management, but placing of rate limits unecessarily and without pressure release options, doesn&rsquo;t make sense</li>
<li><strong>No Self-Service Registration</strong> - As a developer, I need instant gratification.  I need to know if an API will work for me, and getting started immediately will make the difference between using and walking away</li>
<li><strong>Reliability</strong> - I&rsquo;m depending on an API, if its not reliable, I can&rsquo;t depend on for my application.  There are many aspects of API management that goes into reliability--spend the time to understand what it takes</li>
<li><strong>Terms of Use </strong>- Nothing stops a great application idea more than restrict terms of use.  Make the legaleze as developer friendly as you can</li>
<li><strong>Communication</strong> - Regular communication with developers goes a long ways.  Whether blog posts, tweets or working with developers in person at hackathons, communication is an essential for me to adopt an API</li>
<li><strong>Usage Analytics </strong>- As a developer I need to understand how I&rsquo;m using an API.  As an API owner, you should be tracking every aspect of API operations, make sure and share some of this insight with developers</li>
<li><strong>Business Model </strong>- A business model for both API provider and consumer is essential for a healthy API experience.  If the API provider isn&rsquo;t making money or delivering value, it&rsquo;s not sustainable--if the developer can&rsquo;t pay the bills, their integrations will not survive</li>
<li><strong>Clear Pricing</strong> - If I don't know what it will cost for me to accomplish what I need with an API, there is very little chance I will integrate it into my application. I've become very accustomed to knowing my AWS bill, with the clear pricing they provide</li>
</ul>
<p>All nine of these items go into establishing trust between API provider and consumer.  There are some APIs I just trust and others I don&rsquo;t.  Delivery in these nine areas, all feed into whether I trust an API for my business or not</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
</ul>
<p><a title="I depend on 21 separate APIs for my business" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/08/02/the-apis-that-i-depend-on-for-my-business/">I depend on 21 separate APIs for my business</a>.  I&rsquo;m working to add more to this stack, and as a developer I can identify if an API has value within seconds, and hopefully have it integrated with in minutes or at the most a couple of hours. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As an API provider, make sure and find out what drives your developers crazy while integrating, and see what you can do to reduce friction in these nine areas. &nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Sep 2012</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/bizdev.jpeg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>At first glance, APIs seem like something very technical, and the REST pundits do a good job of maintaining this perspective. Even though at the core of what we currently know as a &ldquo;web API&rdquo; there is plenty of tech, web APIs can be much more business than tech--a notion first introduced by&nbsp;<a title="Flickr co-founder Caterina Fake when she coined the term BizDev 2.0" href="http://apievangelist.com/2010/10/07/biz-dev-2-0/">Flickr co-founder Caterina Fake when she coined the term BizDev 2.0</a>.</p>
<p>APIs in practice, are a new approach to business development, using a partner or public facing API that allows consumers to sign up, start accessing valueable business assets in a self-service way--allowing a company to scale business development opportunities with fewer human resources.</p>
<p>Developers can start building applications and businesses around a companies assets, utilizing exposed API resources and self-service tools to establish a business relationship on their own. If an API has the necessary technical and business building blocks, and API consumers have a good enough application, there is a an opportunity for finding success without the need for engagement of traditional business development resources.</p>
<p>This process is BizDev 2.0. &nbsp;However, even with this evolution in establishing new business relationships, your company may not be ready for the flood of new relationships and ideas that will flow in through this new API driven environment. If you handle all the aspects of your API correctly, developers build applications, establish successful businesses and get traction on their ideas, they will need additional resources, attention and potentially, incubation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been the face of this process several times, only to bring in good ideas, get traction and identify potential value, but when I present these implementations internally...I get well, nothing. Companies often don&rsquo;t have the infrastructure and resources to handle this flow of new business opportunities, even a formal process for saying, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a great idea, we see the value, but we don't have the resources to deal with that right now&rdquo;, aka no!</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/Biz-20-Workflow.png" target="_blank"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/Biz-20-Workflow.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>If your going to open up a public or private API, you need to make sure you have a proper BizDev 2.0 process for handling new relationships that get traction via your API. This isn&rsquo;t saying you have to take in every relationship that comes in the door, but you need to have an efficient framework for receiving, evaluating and either accepting as a new relationship or formally declining and providing secondary options for the relationship--one of which can be putting the project back out to the ecosystem, for a crowd-sourced implementation.</p>
<p>Having a formal process, especially one that is transparent will go a long ways in building trust with your developer community. Think of how much different the current Twitter conversation would have been if they had a formal process for handling various business relationships early on? They are just now putting some of this in place, which is good, but much harder to do further down the road.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care how perfect your technical implementation is, if you don&rsquo;t have a decent framework for handling the relationships that come in through your API community, developers will lose trust and look elsewhere to build their applicaitons and businesses. Make sure you have thought through the business development 2.0 process for your API, during the initial planning phase.</p>

        <p>Many providers don't offer a clear pricing page for their services, sticking to old school concepts of software sales where they can change and adjust pricing, depending on who they are talking to.</p>
<p>Have an <a title="easy to find and understand pricing page for an API" href="/buildingblocks/pricing.php">easy to find and understand pricing page for an API</a> or platform is one of the most critical aspects of a successful API.&nbsp;</p>

<p>APIs are everywhere.  The number of public APIs available on <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a> are growing at a dizzying pace, with current count being at 7,207.  The number of <a title="API Service Providers" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/06/15/api-service-provider-roundup-for-2012/">API service providers</a> and tools supporting the new demand for simple, web APIs that mobile and web developers can use has seen the same pace of growth.  I&rsquo;m getting requests for API 101 materials across all business sectors from healthcare to the <a title="federal government" href="/federal_government.php">federal government</a>.</p>
<p>The pace of API consumption is growing as well, and up until recently, we only communicate in single words using APIs--we checkin, post, share, get, friend, like. &nbsp;Now that we have learned the basic words, we need a way to form more "<strong>meaningful&nbsp;phrases and sentences to communicate using APIs</strong>".</p>
<p>In the past month I&rsquo;ve explored a couple different areas where I&rsquo;m seeing APIs evolve from single uses into more aggregate, flowing forms of communication using APIs:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="Backend as a Service (BaaS)" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/08/22/mobile-backend-as-a-service-roundup-and-the-future-of-web-apis/">Backend as a Service(BaaS)</a></strong> - Building in the resources developers need most when building mobile or web apps into a single stack, bringing together the back-end and middleware to make developers more successful.</li>
<li><strong><a title="API Automation" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/08/21/api-automation-platforms/">API Automation</a></strong> - Providing iconographic tools for any users, even non-developers to string together actions between multiple APIs.  Bundling them into reusable recipes, and automating our personal and business lives in the cloud.</li>
<li><strong><a title="Mobile Builder Platforms" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/09/04/mobile-application-builder-platforms/">Mobile Builder Platforms</a> </strong>- Platforms that provide hosted tools for developers and non-developers to rapidly build cross-platform mobile applications using content from RSS and APIs.</li>
<li><strong><a title="API Language Libraries" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/09/06/the-next-generation-of-api-programming-using-temboo-and-webshell/">API Language Libraries</a></strong> - Development of language libraries allowing developers to program against APIs with single lines of code, abstracting away common friction with authentication and inconsistencies between APis.</li>
<li><a title="Aggregate API" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/07/18/a-unified-interface-for-social-apis-with-singly/"><strong>Aggregate APIs</strong>&nbsp;</a>- Building of unified or aggregate APIs like <a href="https://www.singly.com">Singly</a> does with personal data, providing a single authentication, endpoint and object framework that makes speaking with multiple APIs a reality.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the five fastest growing areas where I see API usage being taken to the next level, potentially allowing developers and even non-developers to better communicate using APIs, in ways that are more sophisticated than just single word uses.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/communicate-in-new-ways.jpeg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>Ironically there is a sixth area where APIs takes communicating with APIs to a new level, using speech and voice applications like Apple&rsquo;s Siri. This is one area that we&rsquo;ll continue to see an explosion of APIs to support.  If your business resources aren&rsquo;t exposed via an API, they won&rsquo;t be found by mobile users taking advantage of Siri-like speech applications.</p>
<p>All six of these areas will fuel the demand for APIs, while also adding entirely new ways of communicating.  These API resources will drive new meaning behind existing phrases like take a picture or search for restaurant, while creating entirely new words and phrases--much like we saw in the last ten years with the introduction of API driven concepts such as &ldquo;like&rdquo;, &ldquo;share&rdquo; and the &ldquo;cloud&rdquo;.</p>

<p><a title="Temboo" href="https://www.temboo.com">Temboo</a> and <a title="Webshell" href="http://webshell.io/">Webshell</a> are two pioneers that are taking API development to a new level.  Temboo is building libraries in Java, PHP, Python, or Ruby and Webshell is building libraries in JS, PHP, Ruby as well as providing a command line interface for programming against APIs.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t just programming directly against a single API.  These are libraries that allow you to make calls against APIs using sometimes as little as 2 or 3 lines of code, opening new possibilities of efficiently programming against not just one API, but fluently across multiple APIs.</p>
<p><a title="Webshell" href="http://webshell.io/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/webshell/webshell-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>In addition to simplifying calls made against APIs, both platforms work to abstract away the complexities of API authentication, one of the biggest pain points for developers.</p>
<p>Platforms like Temboo and Webshell absorb the complexity, inconsistencies and difficult aspects of programming using APIs, providing libraries that developers can use in their native programming languages--making developers lives easier.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tough to classify what <a title="Temboo" href="https://www.temboo.com">Temboo</a> and <a title="Webshell" href="http://webshell.io/">Webshell</a> are doing.  I don&rsquo;t have a term or phrase to describe them--one that does them justice.  Everything I say sounds like everything you are already doing with individual APIs.  But this is more.  Temboo and Webshell are defining new ways of speaking using APIs, allowing us to more efficiently speak using the vast amount of valuable resources being exposed via web APIs today.</p>
<p>Temboo and Webshell both have their own approach to solving this problem, which I will dive into separately, in future posts. &nbsp;Right now I just want to identify what they are doing to move forward the API landscape.</p>

<p>The API industry has come of age in 2012.  <a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://www.programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a> has rolled over 7000 public APIs available, <a title="President Obama has mandated that all federal departments and agencies deploy APIs" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2012/06/01/barak-obama-directs-all-federal-agencies-to-have-an-api/">President Obama has mandated that all federal departments and agencies deploy APIs</a>, and there are now two major, enterprise quality open-source API management solutions available.</p>
<p>The industry is ready for its own, vendor neutral event where all API service providers and API owners can come together and discuss both the business and technical side of API design, deployment and management.</p>
<p>With this in mind, I&rsquo;d like to announce the <strong><a title="API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference</a></strong>, in New York City, on November 1st and 2nd 2012.</p>
<p>Whether you already have API or are looking to better understand the strategy and best practices around API management, this is an event for you.</p>
<p>API Strategy &amp; Practice (<a title="#apistrat" href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/realtime/%23apistrat">#apistrat</a>)  is featuring talks from John Musser of ProgrammableWeb, Daniel Jacobson of Netflix, Laura Merling of Alcatel-Lucent, John Sheehan of IFTT with more speakers to come.</p>
<p>The event is happening because of support from our sponsors:</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/09/05/providing-api-developers-with-github-login-using-singly/">Providing API Developers with Github Login Using Singly</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">05 Sep 2012</span>
        <p><a href="https://singly.com/docs/github" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/singly/singly-plus-github.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m building a small API that I want to allow developers to register for.  I don&rsquo;t want to make it a complicated registration process, I just want them to provide some sort of credentials and I will issWue a key that they can use to make API calls.</p>
<p>To keep it simple I&rsquo;m offering a login using a <a title="Github" href="http://www.github.com">Github</a> account.  Every developer has a Github account right?   Well if they don&rsquo;t, they should.  The easiest way there is to enable your API with a Github login is Singly.</p>
<p>Using <a title="Singly" href="http://www.singly.com">Singly</a>, I sign in with my Github account (this is where I got this idea), then I <a href="https://singly.com/apps/new">add a new application</a>, giving it the root URL and callback URL of my API developer area.</p>
<p><a href="https://singly.com/apps/new" target="_blank"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/singly/Singly-Application-Github.png" alt="" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Next I need to link up my Github account to my Singly account, by <a href="https://github.com/settings/applications">adding an application to my Github account</a>.  I give it a name, URL and when adding the callback, I add a Singly specific callback--Singly will handle the rest.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/singly/Github-App-Settings.png" alt="" width="500" /></p>
<p>Now I just add a login with Github button to my developer area with the following URL:&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><em>https://api.singly.com/v0/services/github?access_token=my_token</em></li>
</ul>
<p>When one of my API developers click on the Github login, it will route them to Github for OAuth, back to Singly and to my API callback URL where I can grab the authorization code for the user.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/3646162.js?file=github-login-using-singly.php"></script>
<p>Now I can reference my API developer using their Github account, using their profile image, name as well as having some stats about the user like how many repositories they have, number of followers and who they follow--which provides me a pretty good baseline metric for distinguishing active developers vs. in-active developers.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/kinlane"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/kinlane-github.png" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Github login should be default for all API providers. It reduces developer on-boarding friction with an API, and uses the social network that makes the most sense for API developers.</p>

<p>In my quest to understand the possible <a title="future of web APIs" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/07/27/what-is-the-future-of-web-apis/">future of Web APIs</a>, I&rsquo;m trying to understand the opportunities available for APIs when it comes to latest wave of mobile app builder platforms.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the most familiar with two leading platforms, <a title="CabanaApps" href="http://www.cabanaapp.com/">Cabana</a>&nbsp;and <a title="Tiggzi" href="http://www.tiggzi.com">Tiggzi</a>, but wanted to take a look at what else is out there.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m classifying as a mobile app builder platform, is a web-based platform (not something you have to download), that lets you build a mobile application and usually (but not always) without any development experienced.</p>
<p>There are a lot of sites that claim the ability to build mobile apps in minutes, but many of them clearly are spammy crap.  I tried to sort through as many as I could to come up with this short list of mobile app builder platforms:</p>

</table>
<p>Not all of these mobile app building platforms provide support for external APIs, the ones who do are clearly leaders in the space. &nbsp;Tiggzi and Cabana both provide powerful API support, while others offer modules, connectors that are canned API integration, without much customization from users. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Many of these mobile builder platforms look pretty basic and are trying to capitalize on the needs of the masses wanting to deploy mobile applications. &nbsp;The mobile builder platforms that continue to add in API connectivity, especially with <a title="social and personal data APIs" href="http://www.singly.com">social and personal data APIs</a> will keep up.</p>
<p>I predict in 6 months, I'll come back to this post and 1/3 will be out of business, because they didn't build in API integration.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Sep 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/national-instruments/national-instruments-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p><em>This is a case study sent to me from National Instruments. &nbsp;I just had to post it as is, because it just shows the serious potential of APIs. &nbsp;If cloud computing and mobile hasn't convinced you that APIs are here to stay, take a look at what National Instruments is doing.</em></p>
<p>Over the past five years, <a title="National Instruments" href="http://www.ni.com/">National Instruments</a> (NI) has been using an API strategy to enable a developer ecosystem, based on their <a title="LabView" href="http://www.ni.com/labview/">LabVIEW software platform</a>. &nbsp;NI equips engineers and scientists with tools that accelerate productivity, innovation, and discovery &ndash; and a strong ecosystem is core to their philosophy. &nbsp;This case study takes a look at one approach, and the business role that APIs play in expanding into new markets. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />As background, NI LabVIEW is a productivity tool and graphical programming language used in all kinds of scientific applications. &nbsp;The breadth of users range from &ldquo;aspiring engineers&rdquo; who use a specialized version to program the Lego Mindstorms NXT software, to some of the world&rsquo;s top researchers who use LabVIEW to design complex systems including software for the CERN hadron collider and the SpaceX control center. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br /><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/national-instruments/national-instruments-1.png" alt="" width="576px;" height="267px;" /></p>
<p>Figure 1: &nbsp;LabVIEW is used from K through Rocket Science.</p>
<p>To understand why an API strategy was needed, first consider the standard use-case for LabVIEW. &nbsp;Most companies use LabVIEW as a productivity tool/IDE to develop applications using the default software stack provided by NI, and combining that software with measurement hardware. &nbsp;&nbsp;A common application is production testing of a consumer device, such as the <a href="http://sine.ni.com/cs/app/doc/p/id/cs-662">Xbox 360 controller from Microsoft</a>. &nbsp;&nbsp;LabVIEW allows complete customization of an engineering application, just as is possible with any other programming language. &nbsp;The difference between a text-based language, and LabVIEW&rsquo;s graphical approach, that that the graphical approach is familiar to engineers who grow up drawing block diagrams of systems, and it makes connecting to real-world I/O very efficient. &nbsp;&nbsp;LabVIEW also supports parallelism (multithreading), memory management, built-in analysis, control algorithms, and measurement routines which helps engineering firms build sophisticated applications more quickly. <br /><br />NI&rsquo;s core business model is to serve end-users directly, but the ability to scale through an open platform allows &ldquo;repeatability&rdquo;. &nbsp;In otherwords, through an API strategy, Company A in one specialized domain, can extend the NI platform or build a vertical product on top of it, such that Company B can leverage that. &nbsp;The software stack for 3rd party developers looks very similar to the stack for end-users, with the addition of APIs that enable product development. &nbsp;</p>
<p><br /><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/national-instruments/national-instruments-2.png" alt="" width="386px;" height="288px;" /></p>
<p>Figure 2: &nbsp;API Framework for LabVIEW</p>
<p>In recent years, there have been some very compelling use-cases that have arisen from the LabVIEW ecosystem, and over 100 certified products in total. &nbsp;Here&rsquo;s a breakdown of three examples:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Robotics</strong> - ImagingLab GmbH, is a German company that has created LabVIEW toolkits to allow engineers to control industrial robots from leading manufacturers including DENSO, KUKA, Epson, Yaskawa, Mitsubishi, and more. &nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Big Data</strong> - Neural ID, a venture backed firm in the San Francisco bay area, has created a pattern recognition engine called CURE, to analyze unstructured data. &nbsp;This product sits on top of LabVIEW, and can recognize any kind of waveform and provide analytic capabilities to allow organizations to make better decisions about their data. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s used by companies like ecoATM and NASA. &nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Cloud Computing </strong>- Maintainable Software has developed a software-as-a-service product for use in electronics manufacturing test, for cloud-based data management.&nbsp;&nbsp; Their software is used by customers such as Coulomb Technologies, a leader in electric vehicle chargers.&nbsp; In addition, &nbsp;Maintainable Software has deep expertise in tools used to develop cloud infrastructure, and have published a technical book on the subject.&nbsp; Their product works on the latest tablet devices such as Apple iPads.</li>
</ul>
<ol> </ol>
<p>The companies listed above offer their respective products through NI&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.ni.com/labviewtools/">LabVIEW Tools Network</a>, which is an appstore dedicated to engineers and scientists. <br /><br />In summary, an API strategy can enable 3rd party developers and tech companies to innovate on a mature software platform and expand it into new markets. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s an approach that&rsquo;s not just limited to companies in the mobile or web space&ndash; it is equally as powerful in the B2B space in industries like test &amp; measurement, and embedded control. &nbsp;&nbsp;For a product like LabVIEW with a 25+ year history, an API strategy is one of the best ways to compliment in-house R&amp;D efforts with an ecosystem approach, and drive innovation in emerging areas like Robotics, Big Data, and Cloud.</p>

        <span class="post-date">01 Sep 2012</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/facebook/Facebook+Download+Your+Archive.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was just downloading all of my Facebook data.  You can <a href="https://www.facebook.com/download">go under your account settings and there is a little link</a> that lets you download everything. &nbsp;It takes some time to generate a full archive, but once my archive is ready, they&rsquo;ll email me and I can get at my data and see what the download format looks like.</p>
<p>While waiting, I wanted to see what Google had to offer.  Google has an amazing <a href="https://www.google.com/dashboard">acount management dashboard</a> which provides you access to your settings, some of the data, but Google is also working on their <a title="takeout service" href="https://www.google.com/takeout/">takeout service</a> which gives you downloads for individual services and across multiple services.</p>
<p>That is a pretty good start.  Two of my biggest networks allow me to download data. I wasn't so lucky with the next four:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Twitter - No</li>
<li>Instagram - No</li>
<li>Foursquare - No</li>
<li>LinkedIn - Some (just your connections)</li>
</ul>
<p>I use all six of these services daily.  It bums me out that I can&rsquo;t get out my own data.  Of course all of these services have an API, which allows developers to get at my data, but even <a title="Twitter&rsquo;s API doesn&rsquo;t give me full access to all my accounts data" href="http://apivoice.com/2012/06/29/twitter-continues-to-restrict-access-to-our-tweets/">Twitter&rsquo;s API doesn&rsquo;t give me full access to all my accounts data</a>.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/ifthisthenthat/IFTTT-My-Recipes.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>I want access to a data store of all my <a title="Facebook" href="https://www.singly.com/docs/facebook">Facebook</a>, <a title="Google" href="https://www.singly.com/docs/gcontacts">Google</a>, <a title="Twitter" href="https://www.singly.com/docs/twitter">Twitter</a>, <a title="Instagram" href="https://www.singly.com/docs/instagram">Instagram</a>, <a title="Foursquare" href="https://www.singly.com/docs/foursquare">Foursquare</a> and <a title="LinkedIn" href="https://www.singly.com/docs/linkedin">LinkedIn</a> data in a single location.  There are software available trying to solve this problem such as <a title="ThinkUp" href="http://thinkupapp.com/">ThinkUp</a> or <a title="The Locker Project" href="http://lockerproject.org/">The Locker Project</a>.  As with APIs, these solutions require you to be a developer. (I see ThinkUp has a cloud solution now)</p>
<p>At this point I&rsquo;m thinking about how to build an application using <a title="Singly" href="https://singly.com">Singly</a>, one that allows me to pull posts, tweets, photos, friends and other vital personal data into a single store. &nbsp;I need to think it through.</p>
<p>Then I really start questioning the storage of all of my social data.  Do I really even want it all in one location?  Do I just want it in another location, a sort of plan B.  It really depends on the data.  I guess I have to think about each service and how I want the data replicated, moved, syndicated or otherwise. This is beginning to sound a lot like <a title="API Automation" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/08/21/api-automation-platforms/">API automation</a> to me and not just data liberation.</p>
<p>I hate ending a post, without wrapping up an idea properly. &nbsp;I'll just have to work out in another post, but then again that is why this is on my personal blog and not API Evangelist or API Voice.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/08/30/crowdsourced-api-terms-of-service/">Crowdsourced API Terms of Service</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">30 Aug 2012</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/terms-of-service/developer-rights.jpeg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>API terms of service (TOS) is one of the most critical, yet one of the most silent links for developers who are building apps and business on top of APIs.  Terms of service determine what you can or cannot do with an API, and often times developers do not understand these terms, leaving them vulnerable to some very negative outcomes.</p>
<p>Following in the footprints of a larger project, called &ldquo;<a title="Terms of Service Didn't Read" href="http://tos-dr.info/">Terms of Service Didn&rsquo;t Read</a>&rdquo;, a group of us have gotten together,  and created &ldquo;<a title="API Terms of Service Didn't Read" href="http://api-tos-dr.info/">API Terms of Service Didn't Read</a>&rdquo;, which aims at creating a transparent and peer-reviewed process to rate and analyze API Terms of Service, to establishing a rating classification that all developers can understand.</p>
<p>To seed the process, we went out and reviewed a number of the popular API terms of service and identified seven categories that really affect developers:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Business model (include pricing, rate limits and quotas)</li>
<li>Terms change conditions</li>
<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/terms-of-service/API-Terms-of-Service-Didnt-Read.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" />
<li>Developers restrictions</li>
<li>End-user Privacy</li>
<li>API Data ownership</li>
<li>Data portability</li>
<li>Jurisdiction</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal is to rank each API using a classification ranging from A (good) to E (bad) in these seven areas, so developers can quickly understand where an API stands in the areas that are most important to them.</p>
<p>API Terms of Service Didn't Read, also known as API-ToS;DR, is a crowd-sourced effort and requires community involvement to be successful.  To get involved you can visit the <a href="http://api-tos-dr.info/">API-ToS;DR website</a>, join the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/api-tosdr">working Google Group</a> or help by <a href="https://github.com/tiborvass/ToS-DR">pushing code in the Github repository</a>.</p>
<p>As APIs grow in popularity this problem is only going to get worse.  Terms of service is something I see several groups working to actively understand such as <a title="Singly" href="http://www.singly.com">Singly</a> with their personal data <a title="terminator project" href="https://github.com/quartzjer/Singly/tree/master/Terminator">terminator project</a>, and EFF with their <a title="TOSBack Project" href="http://www.tosback.org/timeline.php">TOSBack project</a>.</p>
<p>Over the coming months I&rsquo;d like to help focus all this energy into <a title="API Terms of Service Didn't Read" href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/84544713/apitos/index.html">API Terms of Service Didn't Read</a>, providing a plain english rating system that all developers can use when navigating the often treacherous landscape of API development.</p>

<p>I don't know about you, but I'm starting to get excited about the potential here.  With almost 20 departments and agencies on board, and 166 APIs planned--there is a lot of potential for the other 226 departments and agencies to see the potential and get on board.</p>
<p>This list of systems are generated programmatically using each department or agencies machine readable digital strategy.  I didn't have to compile this by hand, which shows the potential of the digital strategy to become a federal API discovery platform. &nbsp;You can view the <a title="real-time version of systems pulled from each department or agencies digital strategy" href="/federal_government_digital_strategy_systems.php">real-time version of systems pulled from each department or agencies digital strategy</a>, which gets updated every night when I run my monitoring script.</p>

        <span class="post-date">29 Aug 2012</span>
        <p><a title="Singly" href="https://singly.com" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/singly/Singly-Personal-Data-Explorer.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Last week I announced that <a title="API Evangelist and Singly Were Partnering" href="/2012/08/20/api-evangelist-partners-up-with-singly-to-evolve-the-social-and-personal-api-space/">API Evangelist and Singly were partnering</a>, and while I&rsquo;m helping Singly with their API Evangelism strategy and they are providing me with some vital data on some of the most important APIs in the industry and how developers are using them--I&rsquo;m fascinated by the Singly unified API model and how it can simplify developing apps that use social and personal data.</p>
<p>As I do with any API, I sign up for an account, come up with an idea for a prototype, start hacking, then get to work telling the story of the process.  To get started using Singly, I wanted to build a simply social data explorer that would help me understand how the platform works, but also give me a simple example for explaining to other developers.</p>
<p>Before diving in, let me start with the basics.  What is <a title="Singly" href="https://singly.com" target="_blank">Singly</a>?</p>
<blockquote>Singly is a <a title="unified API interface for accessing social and personal data" href="https://singly.com">unified API interface for accessing social and personal data</a> from the top API platforms. Singly has built an API on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and other API platforms.  Simplified the authentication, objects and API endpoints into a unified API, allowing you to access multiple APIs through a single, simpler API interface, drastically improving the time you have to spend developing social features in your web and mobile apps.</blockquote>
<p>For this project I focused on the top social network APIs: <a title="Facebook" href="https://www.singly.com/docs/facebook" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, <a title="Foursquare" href="https://www.singly.com/docs/foursquare">Foursquare</a>, <a title="Github" href="https://www.singly.com/docs/github">Github</a>, <a title="Instagram" href="https://www.singly.com/docs/instagram">Instagram</a>, <a title="LinkedIn" href="https://www.singly.com/docs/linkedin">LinkedIn</a> and <a title="Twitter" href="https://www.singly.com/docs/twitter">Twitter</a>.  Ok, for many Github isn&rsquo;t a social network.  It&rsquo;s something just  geeks use, but to us, it is a social network.  Anyways, let&rsquo;s start building my social data exploration prototype.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/github/github-logo.png" alt="" width="120" align="right" /></p>
<p>First, I <a title="signed up for Singly which was instant using my Github login" href="/2012/07/18/let-developers-register-for-your-api-with-their-github-profile/">signed up for Singly using my Github login</a>.  Once signed up, I added my first Singly application, which allows me to generate application specific Singly keys, which features I will use, and provides a single interface to store and manage that access for each social network that I will be using.  When adding a new app, it takes some time to setup, and create an app definition in all 6 social networks and add keys to my Singly app, but once you are all done, all you have to worry about is a single Singly key--Singly takes care of the rest.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/singly/Singly-App-Management.jpg" alt="" width="500" /></p>
<p>Now I have a single API for accessing all six social APIs.  Singly provides consistent endpoints across these services:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>https://api.singly.com/v0/services/facebook</li>
<li>https://api.singly.com/v0/services/foursquare</li>
<li>https://api.singly.com/v0/services/github</li>
<li>https://api.singly.com/v0/services/instagram</li>
<li>https://api.singly.com/v0/services/linkedin</li>
<li>https://api.singly.com/v0/services/twitter</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course the objects you can work with across all of them aren&rsquo;t the same, as they can be very different services, but the patterns are consistent and Singly standardizes the authentication and objects as much as possible across all APIs.</p>
<p>The first authentication and code library for Facebook took me about 10 minutes.  Then after that I was able to reuse my code and had all five other services up and running in another 10 minutes.</p>
<p>How you use social data in your web and mobile applications will vary, but the unified API approach offered by Singly is taking API development to a new level.  Using Singly I don&rsquo;t think of terms of single APIs and how I have to approach each integration--I can now think of building social features into my applications across multiple APIs in a very seamless and efficient way.</p>
<p>I will be exploring this same approach, using the other blogging, productivity and quantified self services Singly offers.  I just wanted to get started with the social APIs, and begin wrapping my head around more efficient API development using a unified API like Singly.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Aug 2012</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/mobile-backend-as-a-service/Mobile+Backend+as+a+Service.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />I did a <a title="roundup of Mobile Backend as a Service (MBaaS) providers" href="/2012/08/22/mobile-backend-as-a-service-roundup-and-the-future-of-web-apis/">roundup of Mobile Backend as a Service (MBaaS) providers</a> last week, which brought in a couple recommendations of other companies I should include, and some interesting feedback on how APIs can be integrated with MBaaS platforms.</p>
<p>A very interesting comment left on the post was about MBaaS vendor lock-in:</p>
<blockquote><em>The big problem, IMHO, using a BaaS provider is the so called "vendor lock in". What if my backend provider changes the pricing models, or dismisses the service and go out of the business? </em></blockquote>
<p>To address this issue, the commenter said they are building an open source MBaaS platform, which anyone will be able to download and install on the server or cloud platform of their choice.</p>
<p>Just like with the recent addition of an <a title="open source api management platform" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/06/19/the-100-open-source-api-platform-i-was-looking-for/">open source API management platform</a>, I think an open source Mobile Backend as a Service (MBaaS) would benefit the space tremendously.</p>
<p>The new open source MBaaS is called BaaSBox, and is in early development.  I found a <a href="https://twitter.com/baasbox">Twitter account</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/BaasBox">Facebook page</a>, which I'll pay attention to for updates.</p>
<p>While many of the MBaaS providers are catering to the most common needs of mobile application developers, I can envision an open source MBaaS platform opening up entirely new niche offerings that could provide developers with ready to go platforms for developing, deploying and managing very specialized mobile applications, without "vendor lock-in". &nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to hear your thoughts on MBaaS vendor lock-in and whether an open source version is necessary.</p>

<p>This number of providers really shows a fast growing market of back-end tools to help developers rapidly build mobile applications.  Most of these service providers focus on common use cases like data storage, push notifications and social integration.  As these platforms mature it makes sense that will need to start offering more specialized resources.</p>
<p>While developers can go straight to API service providers on their own, since MBaaS providers are in the business of simplifying development for mobile application builders, it makes a lot of sense for them to start bundling common resources available via social, photo, productivity APIs and location data APIs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">22 Aug 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/landscape monitoring.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></p>
<p>One very important aspect of API Evangelism is landscape analysis.   When you launch an API, you need to have an intimate understanding of the landscape where you will be evangelizing your API and engaging with potential consumers.</p>
<p>I always start by establishing potential 10K foot target areas that I will focusing on in my research.  While these may vary from industry to industry, my starting list is:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Individuals</strong> - Who are the key individual influencers in your target landscape</li>
<li><strong>Competitors</strong> - Know your competitors, you can learn a lot from what they do right or they do wrong</li>
<li><strong>Platforms</strong> - There are an endless amount of platforms that may benefit your company, such as Drupal, Wordpress and Salesforce</li>
<li><strong>Media</strong> - Who are the relevant media and blogs you should be following and engaging with</li>
<li><strong>Partners</strong> - Existing partners who you should be in tune with on the landscape</li>
</ul>
<p>After tackling these areas and identifying who the players are, you will identify other areas that are unique to your API evangelism efforts, so don't stress over whether you have the right areas in the first week.  While researching these areas of my landscape I try to identify specific channels for getting plugged in with landscape targets:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Website URL</strong> - What is the targets root URL for their website</li>
<li><strong>Blog URL</strong> - What is the blog for a target</li>
<li><strong>Blog RSS</strong> - Secondary to the blog, what is the RSS feed so I can programmatically monitor</li>
<li><strong>Twitter</strong> - What is a companies or individuals Twitter handle</li>
<li><strong>LinkedIn</strong> - Identify and sometimes connect with a target&rsquo;s LinkedIn account</li>
<li><strong>Facebook</strong> - Identify and sometimes connect with a target&rsquo;s Facebook account</li>
<li><strong>Github</strong> - Identify, follow and engage with a companies Github profile and appropriate repositories</li>
</ul>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter/twitter-bird-blue-on-white.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>After getting the primary channels for each target on my landscape identified, I will go deeper sometimes and actually identify key individuals associated with target companies, either the founders and / or key employees. I look for Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook and Github for individuals as well, and sometimes even personal blogs when available.</p>
<p>While landscape analysis is an initial project in the first couple weeks of designing your API evangelism strategy, it will be ongoing iniative, in monitoring all target channels in real-time, but also identifying new target groups, companies and individuals or even specific channels not listed above like Tumblr or Google+ each week.</p>
<p>Each industry will be different when identifying the landscape for your API evangelism efforts, but this is a good first round blueprint and has worked well for me on multiple projects.  Let me know if there are any landscape analysis and monitoring tricks you use.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing lots of research into the <a title="future of web APIs" href="/2012/07/27/what-is-the-future-of-web-apis/">future of web APIs</a> lately, and one area that is definitely gaining more traction is the ability to automate tasks, by defining triggers and actions on top of web APIs.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve heard about API automation, it&rsquo;s probably due to the attention <a title="If This Then That" href="http://ifttt.com/">If This Then That (IFTTT)</a> and <a title="Zapier" href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a> have been getting.

<p>API automation platforms provide a new way for developers and non-developers to put API resources to use for business or personal tasks.  These automation platforms provide a new opportunity for companies looking to deploy APIs, providing additional channels for distribution and user acquisition.</p>
<p>If you know of any API automation platforms I missed, let me know.</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Aug 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/federal-government/US_white_house_logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been running a monitoring script every night, so that I could tell when any of the federal department and agency have launched their digital strategy pages, per <a title="Barack Obamas Presidential directive that every Federal Government agency should have an API" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2012/06/01/barak-obama-directs-all-federal-agencies-to-have-an-api/">Barack Obamas Presidential directive that every Federal Government agency should have an API</a>, and the White House CIO's strategy, entitled "<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-government-strategy.pdf">Digital Government: Building a 21st Century Platform to Better Serve the American People</a>"</p>
<p>I noticed that many of the departments and agencies aren&rsquo;t properly using HTTP response codes, and when I pulled pages, I often get 302 redirects to 404 pages, so I tended to treat 301, 302, 500 as 404&rsquo;s.  Today, I noticed that some of them actually were redirecting to their digital strategies, published at alternate locations, other than directed by the White House strategy, which was [domain]/digitalstrategy.</p>
<p>Recognizing this I put in some logic to handle redirects and check if it was a valid strategy page, and after re-running the script I found 11 more digital strategies published, bringing the total to 14 to date:</p>

<p>With 246 federal departments and agencies, we have a long way to go, but I&rsquo;m optimistic that we&rsquo;ll see enough publish their strategies, identify enough high value data-sets to deploy as APIs, so that the developer community can get to work building some important web and mobile apps or data visualizations.</p>
<p>Once the other departments and agencies see what is possible, hopefully we can get more of them on board, creating somewhat of a domino effect for API deployment, getting us closer to a reality where machine readable data is as common as the PDF in Washington DC.</p>

<p>The world around us is being redefined and a new currency is taking shape.  Tweets on <a title="Twitter" href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a>, wall posts to <a title="Facebook" href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a>, pictures on <a title="Instagram" href="http://instagram.com">Instagram</a>, files on <a title="Dropbox" href="http://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> and health data via <a href="http://fitbit.com">Fitbit</a> are emblematic of the emerging API-driven economy.</p>
<p>This data isn&rsquo;t just social, nor just a currency. It is vital personal data that contains details from intimate aspects of our daily lives.  Platform players like Facebook and Twitter have shown through their APIs the possibilities that emerge when developers can build, unfettered with their own creativity on top of this data -- enriching people&rsquo;s lives in a richer, more connected way.</p>
<p>With the number of social and personal data APIs available today, it is getting increasingly difficult for developers to keep up to speed on which platforms are most important to their end users, the technical differences between each platform&rsquo;s APIs and where to keep up with the changes from each platform as they are rolled out.</p>
<p>Even with all this confusion, there is help:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a></strong> delivers news about the business of APIs and best practices for API owners, politics around API management and developers rights, in hopes of providing insight into which APIs are delivering the most value for the API space and application developers</li>
<li><strong><a title="Singly" href="https://singly.com">Singly</a></strong> provides a single API with which developers can build against multiple social and personal data API platforms using a single authentication model, standardized endpoints, a common object model and a whole host of solutions for challenging infrastructure issues that data intensive applications face</li>
</ul>
<p>We believe the industry needs more leadership and content and we have partnered up to deliver:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Real-time news, changes and updates about top social and personal data platforms Information about the business of APIs and best practices from direct experience with top social and personal data APIs</li>
<li>Technical details from daily monitoring and integration with top social and personal APIs Politics and legal issues around personal and social data, how this impacts end users, API owners and developers</li>
<li>Data about how developers access and use social and personal data in their applications A larger voice for developers in a space, where currently API owners dominate the conversation Education, access and greater awareness to end users of their personal and social data Assistance for API owners to better reach and leverage the API developer community</li>
</ul>
<p>In spending time with Jason Cavnar (<a title="@jasoncavnar" href="https://twitter.com/jasoncavnar">@jasoncavnar</a>), Jeremie Miller (<a title="@jeremie" href="https://twitter.com/jeremie">@jeremie</a>) and the Singly team, it&rsquo;s clear they have a very valuable and unique perspective when it comes to API consumption and the future of personal data -- not only for consumers and developers but also that will benefit the platforms themselves. Every day they are monitoring and consuming the personal and social data flowing through the most important APIs in the space and I can&rsquo;t wait to tell the stories of their journey and share their insights along the way. Keep an eye out for these stories in the coming weeks.</p>

<li><strong>7.1 - </strong>Engage with customers to identify at least two existing priority customer-facing services to optimize for mobile use</li>

<p>While the Department of Commerce and Department of Education have only published paragraphs discussing how they are engaging with users, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has identified three datasets for the web API portion and two optimized for mobile use.  All three have published their digital strategy in HTML, XML and JSON formats, meeting the requirements of "machine readable by default".</p>
<p>I anticipate we&rsquo;ll see many more agencies releasing their digital strategies this week, but there is no way to tell how many agencies will be able to get on board with the CIO&rsquo;s strategy in time.  No matter what, the next 3 months will be critical time for APIs in Washington DC, not just because of the presidential election, but the end of November will be the next milestone where agencies are expected to have established an agency-wide governance structure for developing  and delivering digital services via web APIs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">18 Aug 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/events/mcjug-rockville-md/mcjug_logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>While out in Washington DC last week I was invited to speak at the <a title="Montgomery County Java Users Group" href="http://www.mcjug.org/">Montgomery County Java User Group</a> in Rockville, MD.  Without much of an understanding of who my audience was I chose to talk about the <a title="Building Blocks of a Successful API" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/08/12/the-building-blocks-of-a-successful-api/">Building Blocks of a Successful API</a>.</p>
<p>There was about 25 developers attending from various companies with a heavy health care influence, since the building that hosted the event was home to several health care technology companies.   There were also developers from firms who contracted with federal agencies ranging from Census to the Department of Defense.</p>
<p>I was pleasantly surprised to find out how hungry many of these developers were for information about the API movement and what is working in the open, public API space.  As with my experience with other enterprise companies, these developers were well versed in APIs in the context of service oriented architecture, but had little experience with the building blocks used by many of the successful public APIs operating today.</p>
<p>My presentation went for about an hour, then we discussed not just the business of APIs, but the politics of APIs for another hour.  With the health care presence in the room, the conversation quickly focused on the challenges around deploying APIs in an industry that is so heavily regulated, but also dominated by several 1000 pound gorillas who really have no interest in opening up data, something that threatens their control and dominance.</p>
<p>If I had more money, I think I could spend 100% of my time traveling around the country talking to user groups like MCJUG.  There is a hunger for information about the tech, business and politics of APIs by developers, and I will be coming back soon to Rockville, MD to talk more about APIs with MCJUG. For now I will keep publishing as much content as I can to help these developers understand APIs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">18 Aug 2012</span>
        <p>Continuing my API Craft road show, I landed in Washington DC for the second week in August.  As I planned my trip to the nations capital, I planted the seeds for an API Craft DC version.</p>
<p>I chose a popular H Street watering hole, the <a title="Queen Vic" href="http://www.thequeenvicdc.com/">Queen Vic</a> to host the event, and in tune with <a title="API Craft PDX" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/07/20/definition-of-api-craft/">API Craft PDX</a> and <a title="API Craft SFO" href="/2012/08/18/api-craft-san-francisco/">API Craft SFO</a> about 10-15 people showed up to drink beer and discuss APIs, DC Style.</p>

<p>I was impressed with not just the energy for APIs in DC, but the startup buzz occurring in a city, many like to associate with slow moving government bureaucracy.  API Craft DC brought out one API Service Provider <a title="APIphany" href="http://apiphany.com/">APIphany</a>, and an assortment of companies that contract for the government and several other private companies including API geeks from <a title="QVC" href="http://www.qvc.com/">QVC</a>.</p>
<p>API Craft DC has triggered requests for three new gatherings that I will be planning, including API Craft NYC, API Craft Philadelphia and API Craft Atlanta.  Dates coming as soon as I can.</p>

        <p>On the heels of the successful <a title="API Craft OSCON Portland, OR" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/07/20/definition-of-api-craft/">API Craft meetup in Portland during OSCON</a>, I was landing in San Francisco for a few days and at the request of SFO API folk, quickly organized a meetup at the Chieftain Pub, and thanks to <a title="@abraham" href="https://twitter.com/abraham">@abraham</a> it was a great turnout.</p>
<p>10-15 people showing up seems to be about the normal for these events, and this API craft had a good showing of API Service Providers with 3Scale, Apigee, Mashery and Mashape representing.  Then we had API folks from IFTTT, Pearson and SendGrid.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-craft/API-Craft-SFO-July-2012.png" alt="" width="525" /></p>
<p>It was also great to have out fellow evangelist and unicorn herder, @abraham.  The SFO API Craft meetup was another great gathering in a growing trend within the API community, and I plan on having them in every city that I can, I hope you do too!</p>

<p>When I started API Evangelist two years ago, I noticed some common practices by API owners, in how they tailored their API areas, and I started calling these <a title="API Building Blocks" href="/buildingblocks/">API building blocks</a>.  I started a section of the site dedicated to my building block philosphy and showcased what I felt were the most common building blocks across the most successful APIs.</p>
<p>Two years later, and after having viewed just about every API publicly available, I have updated my <a title="building blocks section" href="/buildingblocks/">building blocks section</a>, based upon the practices of 1500 of the most successful APIs.  Along with this update I have also published a white paper called <a title="The Building Blocks of a Successful API" href="/the_building_blocks_of_a_successful_api.php">The Building Blocks of a Successful API</a>.</p>
<p><a title="The Building Blocks of a Successful API" href="/the_building_blocks_of_a_successful_api.php">The Building Blocks of a Successful API</a> is not meant to provide detail on implementing these building blocks, but shed light on the common ones used by the top APIs.  The white paper is 32 pages long and provides:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>73 Common API Building Blocks, in 18 Categories</li>
<li>30 Top APIs for Review While Planning Your API</li>
<li>Building Block Checklist for Easy Review Before Launch</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this information is freely available on this site, but will require some clicking to gather across pages and blog posts.  If you can&rsquo;t afford the white paper, I want you to be able to learn what you need to be successful. The Building Blocks of a Successful API is meant to be a single PDF, for you to easily read, and find success in planning your own API.</p>
<p><a title="The Building Blocks of a Successful API" href="https://tinypay.me/~DRCho6h/the-building-blocks-of-a-successful-api-by-kin-lane">The Building Blocks of a Successful API</a> is the first in a series of white papers I&rsquo;m producing to provide the resources needed to successfully plan, deploy and manage your APIs while also producing the revenue I need to keep doing the research and writing the drives <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> and <a title="API Voice" href="http://apivoice.com">API Voice</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks for your support, and I good luck with your API!</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Aug 2012</span>
        <p>When planning an API, I always tell people to go look at as many of the top APIs as they can before crafting their own API strategy.  I'm always surprised how many API owners I talk to don't actually use other APIs.  They can usually reference the main ones like Twitter and Facebook, or the usual rockstar Twilio--but very few can cite 10 or more APIs they like.</p>
<p>Recently I spent some time looking through all of <a title="ProgrammableWeb API Directory" href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory">ProgrammableWeb's APIs</a>, and I made a list of the 30 APIs I like, and would reference when designing an API strategy.  Since I'm more about the <a title="Business of APIs" href="/business_of_apis.php">Business of APIs</a> and not just the finer, technical points, these I feel are unique because of their business approach to delivering their API.</p>
<p>Here are 30 of the best APIs I think you should look at when planning your own API strategy:</p>

<p>Not all of these APIs do it perfectly, but each of them have something we can learn from when planning, deploying and managing our own APIs. &nbsp;All of these APIs have an active presence, so I recommend reaching out to them and ask questions about what made them successful or follow their blog and Twitter accounts.</p>
<p>If there is an API you feeling strong about that is not on this list, please let me know. &nbsp;Or if you feel one of these APIs doesn't do something right, either technical or otherwise, also let me know as well (except if its Twitter). &nbsp;</p>

<p>I maintain an active list of online services I depend on for my business, in Evernote.  Each month I spend an hour or two maintaining this list, to make sure it is complete and actively change my logins when appropriate.  As a recovering IT guy, and maintaining infrastructure for myself, but also <a title="Audrey Watters" href="http://hackeducation.com">Audrey Watters</a>--so I keep good tabs on the various services I use.</p>
<p>While going through this my services list this month, I added a new section to it, and started tracking if I depend on the service for their API.  I have enough automated jobs running on top of APIs I needed to make sure I keep good track of which APIs I depend on. Here are some of the API I depend on to keep my business operational.</p>
<p>First I depend on a couple of key Google APIs:</p>

<p>I depend on these APIs to run <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, <a title="API Voice" href="http://apivoice.com">API Voice</a> and <a title="The API Stack" href="http://theapistack.com">The API Stack</a> as well as support the other research and consulting that I do.  Some of these services I pay for, some of them I use for free.  Usually if a service sticks around in my world for more than 3 or 4 months I pay for some sort of premium account or access.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure I depend on a lot of APIs, partly because this is my game, I&rsquo;m an API Evangelist.  But it is also because APIs provide me with the data and resources I need to operate, and as a programmer I&rsquo;m able to quickly put APIs to use for my business.</p>
<p>Tracking on the APIs I depend will be a regular part of my IT strategy, and I&rsquo;m even going to publish this as a public page on my websites--showcasing what APIs have done for my business.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m always on the lookout for extremely simple ways API Evangelists can support their developers without rolling out complex tools or platforms.  The latest approach comes from the <a title="Disqus API" href="http://disqus.com/api/docs/">Disqus API</a>, and how they are using Twitter to answer developer questions.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" style="padding-left: 45px;">
<p>Tweet with the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23DisqusFAQ">#<strong>DisqusFAQ</strong></a> to get your frequently asked questions answered by <a href="https://twitter.com/disqus">@<strong>disqus</strong></a>!</p>
&mdash; DISQUS (@disqus) <a href="https://twitter.com/disqus/status/227934056820662272">July 25, 2012</a></blockquote>
<script src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
<p>Using a #hashtag is a great way to allow developers to ask questions without learning some new system or complex process.  They can simply Tweet out their question in real-time, in a format they are hopefully already familiar with.</p>
<p>As an API owner, you can quickly help solve a developers problem, allowing them to get back to developing.  Because of the Twitter 140 character format it will help keep their questions brief.  Then using the Twitter REST API, you can easily pull, filter and integrate FAQs for your API into your master FAQ list.</p>
<p>Thanks Disqus for keeping developer support so simple.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/07/29/api-driven-twitter-advertising/">API Driven Twitter Advertising</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">29 Jul 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter/advertising/Twitter-Ads.png" alt="" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m playing around with my <a title="Twitter Advertising" href="https://ads.twitter.com">Twitter Advertising</a> account, trying to understand Twitter&rsquo;s path to monetization.  The Twitter Advertising interface is pretty clean and simple, allowing me to promote my account or tweets in four easy steps.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - I can choose the locations where I want to reach users anywhere in the world, in specific countries only or in specific US cities:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter/advertising/Twitter-Advertising-1.png" alt="" width="525" /></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - I can promote my Twitter account prominently in the who to follow section to users that are most likely to be interested in my account--I only pay for new followers that I gain:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter/advertising/Twitter-Advertising-2.png" alt="" width="525" /></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - I can promote my Tweets, prominently displaying them to other users with similar interests:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter/advertising/Twitter-Advertising-3.png" alt="" width="525" /></p>
<p><strong>Step 4 </strong>- Then plug in my credit cards to pay for the ad spend I setup for my promoted account or tweets:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter/advertising/Twitter-Advertising-4.png" alt="" width="525" /></p>
<p>Twitter Advertising is pretty straightforward.  I wouldn&rsquo;t call it anything revolutionary.  But it is implemented simply, making it work for the masses.  I could see businesses adopting it right alongside Google AdWords.</p>
<p>By itself Twitter Advertising makes sense, but when you step back and look at it in context of the rest what&rsquo;s going on with the Twitter ecosystem, I wonder if they are seeing the big picture.</p>
<p>As a Twitter Advertiser will I be able to:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Use the Twitter API to truly understand the space I&rsquo;m advertising in?  Track on patterns, opportunities and be able to get at the data I need to make my advertising successful?   If I have to pay Gnip or DataSift for my business intelligence, it won&rsquo;t work</li>
<li>Have access to an API that gives me full access to the Twitter advertising resource? Allowing me to programmatically tailor my Twitter Advertising campaign</li>
</ul>
<p>It just seems like to me that Twitter is seriously reducing the potential network effect by not including the Twitter API ecosystem in the Twitter Advertising program.   Developers could help deliver innovation beyond just promoted accounts and tweets, extend the reach of advertising if they had more access to data via the Twitter APIs, optimize advertising campaign effectiveness with more API access as well as automate Twitter advertising with an API directly for the advertising platform.</p>

<p>APIs are about to enter a new phase, one where developers can easily program using multiple APIs at once, and non-developers can easily introduce API automation into both their business and personal worlds. &nbsp;A time where APIs are seen as a valuable resource anyone can quickly put use, not just as a technical interface only the geekiest of us understand.</p>
<p>Web APIs have matured out of its earlier service oriented architecture (SOA) roots, often shedding a rigid SOAP approach to a more flexible RESTful implementation, increased efficiency by opting for more lightweight JSON over bloated XML, and becoming more accessible with API explorers and interactive documentation like <a title="Swagger" href="http://swagger.wordnik.com/">Swagger</a>, <a title="Mashery I/O Docs" href="http://www.mashery.com/product/io-docs">Mashery I/O Docs</a>, and <a title="Apigee Console" href="https://apigee.com/console">Apigee&rsquo;s Console</a>.</p>
<p>Now with over <a title="6,000 public APIs available" href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2012/05/22/6000-apis-its-business-its-social-and-its-happening-quickly/">6,000 public APIs available</a>, there is a need to get more efficient about how we work with APIs, and evolve to where we can truly program the web. &nbsp;But to get there, we have to add a new platform layer that can help standardize the authentication, interfaces and resource types available--simplifying how not just developers, but average users can take advantage of APIs.</p>
<p>One approach is targeting developers with new languages, or extensions of existing languages that can be used to program against one or many APIs, as with <a title="Webshell" href="http://webshell.io/home">Webshell</a> and <a title="Temboo" href="https://www.temboo.com/">Temboo</a>:</p>
<table cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" width="90%" align="center">

<p>The second approach is targeting a wider audience with automation platforms that create API driven tasks, such as <a title="IFTTT" href="http://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a>, <a title="Elastic.io" href="http://elastic.io/">Elastic.io</a> and <a title="When a User" href="http://whenauser.com/">WhenAUser</a>:</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>Both approaches provide a much needed platform to help make APIs more accessible, where one is still targeting the developer community and the other will allow anyone to take advantage of APIs through special automation tools and connectors.&nbsp;Beyond these programmatic and automation approaches there is a third approach to API usage, currently being defined to support mobile application development. &nbsp;Companies like <a title="Cabana" href="http://www.cabanaapp.com/">Cabana</a> and <a title="Tiggzi" href="http://tiggzi.com/home">Tiggzi</a> are changing the way we build API driven mobile apps:</p>

<tr>
<td width="160" align="center"><a title="Cabana" href="http://www.cabanaapp.com/"><img title="cabana-logo" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/cabanaapp/cabana-logo.png" alt="" width="130" /></a></td>

<td><a title="Tiggzi" href="http://tiggzi.com/home">Tiggzi</a>&nbsp;- A GUI mobile application development platform</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>These GUI mobile application builders allow developers and non-developers to rapidly deploy mobile applications built on top of APIs, providing new ways of abstracting away the complexity of API integration we commonly experience today. &nbsp;This approach to&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/06/03/rise-of-mobile-backend-as-a-service-mbaas-api-stacks/">API bundling is also being put to use by Mobile Backend as a Service (MBaaS) providers like Kinvey</a>, who are building in API gateways for common APIs that would be needed by mobile developers--a move we&rsquo;ll see mimicked by other MBaaS providers.</p>
<p>Which of these three approaches reflect the future of the ProgrammableWeb? &nbsp;Will it be an API programming language, an API automation platform, mobile back-end as a service or a blend of them all?</p>
<p>Only time will tell, but no matter which approach get us there, I can see we are getting closer to a truly&nbsp;<a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://www.programmableweb.com/">ProgrammableWeb</a>.</p>

<p>Embeddable tools like widgets, gadgets and buttons built on top of an API are nothing new. A healthy embeddable strategy was behind the success of popular platforms like Youtube, Google Maps, Twitter and Facebook.</p>
<p>Even with this success, embeddable tools often get overlooked by many companies when planning their APIs.   I was recently introduced to <a title="BandPage" href="http://www.bandpage.com/">BandPage</a>, formerly known as RootMusic, who made a name for themselves by building a successful band promotion application within the Facebook ecosystem, and have crafted a very interesting embeddable strategy. To recover from a recent Facebook platform change, BandPage employed a robust embeddable strategy to quickly decouple their business from Facebook, enabling bands to not only deploy on Facebook, but manage music, photos, tour dates across the web.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/bandpage/BandPage-Update-Once-Publish-Everwhere.png" alt="" width="525" /></p>
<p>Driving the embeddable band pages is a robust JavaScript API, which isn&rsquo;t publicly available, but at some point it&rsquo;s something they&rsquo;d like to expose.  Calling BandPage&rsquo;s embeddable tools widgets really doesn&rsquo;t do them justice, they have a seriously crack team of developers who&rsquo;ve built a pretty sophisticated platform. &nbsp;Their approach deserves notice, not just for the embeddable strategy, but the way they were able to use it to quickly recover from the changes they encountered in the Facebook ecosystem.</p>
<p>I think a healthy embeddable strategy is something every API owner should craft. &nbsp;The right set of embeddable tools can extend your reach beyond the average developer community, while also allowing your data and resources to exist on any site or platform.   And in the case of <a title="BandPage" href="http://www.bandpage.com/">BandPage</a> it can also free you from having your wagon hitched to any single platform like Facebook, and open up much wider opportunities for success.</p>

        <p><a title="Apigee" href="http://apigee.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-service-providers/apigee-logo.gif" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>The current API development space is very self-ruled, in that web API developers have freed themselves of earlier SOA attempts to rigidly define and ultimately constricted API growth, into a more grassroots, community-owned approach to RESTful API design.</p>
<p>You can see this happen in real-time on the public Google Group called <a title="API Craft" href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/api-craft">API Craft</a>.   API Craft was started by <a title="Apigee" href="http://apigee.com/" target="_blank">Apigee</a>, as an open forum for sharing and developing knowledge and skills around APIs, where you can find the latest throughts, from the smartest people in the space. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I thoroughly enjoy the online version of <a title="API Craft" href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/api-craft">API Craft</a>, and just experienced my first offline version of API Craft at OSCON in Portland this week.  Several API folks got together for beers and API Craft discussion at the White Eagle Saloon creating an awesome real-time, face-to-face extension of the online <a title="API Craft" href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/api-craft">API Craft</a> group--an experience I intend to initiate whenever I am in new cities around the country, and I encourage you to do the same.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/oscon-drinkup-2.jpg" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>I think Apigee has really started something important and feeling inspired, I wanted to share my thoughts on a definition of API Craft.  Deriving from the dictionary definition of craft:</p>
<blockquote><em>"Skill in doing or making something, as in the arts; proficiency" and "The membership of such an occupation or trade; guild."</em></blockquote>
<p>I suggest the following definitions of API Craft:</p>
<blockquote><em>"An online forum for sharing and achieving proficiency in the skill and art of web API design, development and management" and "A physical gathering for discussion of the skill and art of web API design, development and management while enjoying a craft beer and good food."</em></blockquote>
<p>Apigee has started something that has taken on a life of its own, becoming a powerful, community driven approach to evolving the skill and art of web API design, development and management--both on and offline.</p>
<p>I encourage you do participate, and I&rsquo;d love to hear your definition of API Craft, as well as more information your local API Craft gatherings. &nbsp;I look forward to seeing you online and in-person at the API craft gatherings.</p>

<p>I was playing with <a title="Singly" href="https://singly.com/">Singly</a>, a unified social API last night. One of the first things I saw, after landing on the home page, were two choices for signing up as a developer--one with Facebook or the other with my Github account.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m seeing Github as an option for API developer registration, more frequently these days. And it makes sense.  Each of my social networks have a place in my life--Facebook is my more personal social network, Twitter my more public persona, Google is my business platform and Github reflects my developer profile.</p>
<p>When registering for APIs and development centric platforms I&rsquo;d much prefer to keep these associated with <a href="https://github.com/kinlane">my Github profile.</a> And for an API owner it makes sense to have developers linked using Github, because of the social effects and interactions possible with code library repositories and documentation.</p>
<p>With two clicks I was signed up for Singly, using my Github, and I dropped into the dashboard where I was given an option to add my first application and begin integrating.</p>
<p>Developer registration using Github should be standard operating procedure for all APIs. Github is the social network I want APIs to interact with me on, and it is definitely where API owners want to connect with their developers, so they can further interact around code, documentation and all the other geeky goodness Github provides.</p>

        <p><a title="Singly" href="https://www.singly.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/singly/singly-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Web APIs come in all shapes and sizes.   The differences between API authentication, interfaces and data types can be a big challenge when developers work with multiple social networking APIs like Twitter, Facebook and social media APIs like Instagram and Flickr.</p>
<p>Each API tends to run with their own interpretation of what a RESTful API means, leaving developers left with navigating not only the differences between various APIs, but the changes a single API will make from version to version.</p>
<p>Many industry pundits claim this will become unmanageable.  I think its the nature of the web API space, and we should leave API owners to do what they do best, rather than forcing them to agree on standards. &nbsp;Then how will we bridge these difference?  This is an important opportunity for providers to step in and aggregate critical APIs within specific sectors, and provide a unified interface that developers can depend on.  One example of this in action is <a title="Singly" href="https://www.singly.com/" target="_blank">Singly</a>.</p>
<p>Singly aggregates some of the most important social APIs, simplifying authentication, creating consistent patterns for API endpoints and a unified set of data types to work with across all supported APIs.  Singly pays attention to the differences between APIs and versions, so developers can do what they do best--build social applications, using social data from the platforms their users are already on.</p>
<p>Immediately the pundits will ask, how can they keep up with all the changes?  I respond with how can we not move this industry forward without someone paying attention to it for developers.   I see Singly as a necessary component for the API industry to stabilize and move forward.  Developers needing to integrate with a single API can visit the API directly, while developers who need to integrate across multiple APIs can depend on Singly.</p>
<p>I see opportunities for the Singly model to be applied in other niche areas like location based services, video, restaurants and government to just name a few fast growing API business sectors.   It&rsquo;s clear that <a title="RESTafarians" href="http://mikeschinkel.com/blog/whatisarestafarian/">RESTafarians</a> aren&rsquo;t going to come to an agreement on a single stand, and API owners are busy providing the data and resources they specialize in, so a unified approach like Singly appears to be a healthy path forward for standardizing APIs, creating a more stable interfac for developers.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Jul 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/dwolla/dwolla-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>Next generation payment platform <a title="Dwolla" href="/admin/blog/dwolla.com">Dwolla</a> just revamped the home page of their developer center to speak to the widest audience possible.  When you land at <a title="developers.dwolla.com" href="http://developers.dwolla.com">developers.dwolla.com</a> you are given two options:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="I can code" href="http://developers.dwolla.com/dev">I can code</a></strong> - You know the difference between Java and JavaScript and just want to dive into our API documentation</li>
<li><strong><a title="I don't code" href="http://developers.dwolla.com/bd/why">I don't code</a></strong> - You're a non-technical executive, the master of partnerships and products, and want to know why Dwolla is right for you</li>
</ul>
<p>This is an approach I've been long advocating for, and rarely see in API areas. The best case study I always point out is the <a title="LinkedIn developers area" href="https://developer.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn developers area</a>, who provide buttons, widgets and embeddable tools that non-developers can put to use.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://developers.dwolla.com/"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/dwolla/Dwolla-Developer-Area.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>Why do this? Well according to Dwolla, "One of the biggest misunderstandings about API portals is that their purpose is only for developers. That&rsquo;s just not true. Integrations start with a spark of curiosity, &ldquo;Would this work for my company?&rdquo; Technical or not, who asks that question is irrelevant at that point; how it&rsquo;s answered is what determines the outcome."</p>
<p>Dwolla's approach reflects the core philosophy of why I started API Evangelist.  I'm not advocating just to developers about the power of APIs, I'm evangelizing to the business leaders and decision makers about the power of APIs.</p>
<p>While actually integrating with your API might be a technical endeavor, much of the business decision around using your API will most likely be made by a non-developer.  Make sure your API speaks more than just geek, and reaches as wide an audience as possible.</p>

<p>As we continue to stress over all the news of <a title="API Ecosystem Battles" href="/2012/06/29/the-api-economy-welcomes-its-early-trade-wars/">API ecosystem battles</a>, and how APIs owners are evil, and once a business grows up, it has to choose between being a hobby developer platform or real grown up business--let&rsquo;s remember the <a title="web API pioneers" href="/2011/02/10/history-of-apis-birth-through-social/">web API pioneers</a>.</p>
<p><a title="Salesforce" href="/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-salesforce-com/">Salesforce</a>, <a title="ebay" href="/2011/01/26/history-of-apis-ebay/">eBay</a> and <a title="Amazon" href="/2011/01/28/history-of-apis-amazon-e-commerce/">Amazon</a> are all three going strong, making money, treating developers as part of the equation and continue to operate legitimate business via APIs for over a decade now.  These three API pioneers set the stage for the API industry during the first &ldquo;dot com bubble&rdquo; in 2000 and Amazon in 2002, and 10 years later still proving you can become an Internet powerhouse with the help of your API developer ecosystem.</p>
<p><a href="/2011/01/26/history-of-apis-ebay/"><img style="padding: 20px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/ebay/ebay-developer-program-history.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>API skeptics always step up and say they are different, that they have core web products, existing business models, etc. Sure, there are differences, but Salesforce, eBay and Amazon have all managed to achieve success with continued investment in their API ecosystem.  None of these platforms have had to restrict or shed their developers to make ends meet, once the utopian API early days are over.</p>
<p>When I read comments, tweets and other noise from people about what fools developers are for depending on an API, I stop and think about these API pioneers.  Developing a large, healthy API ecosystem is not easy--but when you see your API as an essential part of your core platform, and give it the necessary resources, you can strike the harmonious balance necessary to make APIs work.</p>
