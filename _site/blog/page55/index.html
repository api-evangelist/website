        <p><a href="https://twitter.com/mamund" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/mike-amundsen/Mike-Amundsen.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Master API architect at <a title="Layer7 Technologies" href="http://www.layer7tech.com/">Layer7 Technologies</a> Mike Amundsen (<a href="https://twitter.com/mamund" target="_blank">@mamund</a>) has a great post this week on <a href="http://www.layer7tech.com/blogs/index.php/four-tech-related-trends-that-will-shape-2013/" target="_blank">Four Tech-Related Trends That Will Shape 2013</a>.</p>
<p>One of the predictions that caught my eye was that <em>"individual service deployments on the Web will get smaller and more numerous"</em>--he clarifies it with:</p>
<blockquote><em>Influenced by the existence of the many mobile apps running on a single device, Web-based services will become small, single-focused offerings that (in the words of Doug Mcllroy) &ldquo;do one thing and do it well.&rdquo; This will also explode the number of available services. The advantage of this trend will be an increase in the agility and evolvability of service offerings. The challenge will be an increased need for governance at the &ldquo;micro-service&rdquo; level.</em></blockquote>
<p>I have to agree.  I think the smaller we can break resources down, the better.  Agility is key in the API economy.  But as Mike points out it won't come without its new set of problems, like life cycle, governance and discovery.</p>
<p>Much like web pages, I think we'll still try to estimate the number APIs available, but there will be so many, we will lose track in the near future.  But we'll find an organic approach to designing, deploying, managing, discovering and consuming web APIs that strikes a balance.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Feb 2013</span>
        <p><a href="https://twitter.com/mamund" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/mike-amundsen/Mike-Amundsen.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>

<p>One of the predictions that caught my eye was that "server mash-ups will increase but client mash-ups will decline"--he clarifies it with:</p>
<blockquote><em>The increasing popularity of languages like Node.js, Erlang and Closure will make implementing server-side mash-ups more efficient and easier to maintain than doing the same work within a client application; especially for the mobile platform. This will reduce the &ldquo;chattiness&rdquo; of client-side applications and increase the security and flexibility of server-side implementations. The result will be a perceived increase in responsiveness and a reduced use of battery power on mobile apps.</em></blockquote>
<p>As with my earlier post, <a title="individual API deployments will get smaller and more numerous" href="/2013/02/02/the-scientific-archive-of-biodiversity-audio-and-video-recordings-needs-an-api/">individual API deployments will get smaller and more numerous</a>, I agree 100%.  This is where I&rsquo;m going with my post this week on <a title="Virtual API Stacks" href="/2013/01/28/virtualized-api-stacks/">virtual API stacks</a>.  With so many individual resources available on the web, in the coming years we&rsquo;ll see increased &ldquo;mashing up&rdquo; or &ldquo;virtualization&rdquo; of new stacks, that are meaningful to a particular app or group of developers.</p>
<p>An example of this in the wild is&nbsp;<a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a>, with their API aggregation or mashup, which is available as a service, but is also <a href="https://github.com/Singly/hallway">available as open source on Github as Hallway</a>.  Another recent example is potentially the <a title="OpenKit Gaming BaaS" href="/2013/02/01/new-open-source-backend-as-a-services-platform-for-game-developers/">OpenKit Gaming BaaS</a>, which promised to be an open stack designed for game developers.</p>
<p>My predication is we&rsquo;ll see many more returns from server side API mashups, than we did during the client side mashup gold rush days! &nbsp;Especially if providers open source these stacks, while also offering as a service.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/02/01/traffic-and-weather-virtualized-api-stacks/">Traffic and Weather - Virtualized API Stacks</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">01 Feb 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://trafficandweather.io/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/traffic-and-weather/Traffic-and-Weather.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I recently added the <a href="http://trafficandweather.io/">Traffic and Weather podcast</a> to the right hand menu for everyone to enjoy. What John Sheehan (<a href="http://twitter.com/johnsheehan">@johnsheehan</a><span>&nbsp;)</span> and Steve Marx (<a href="http://twitter.com/smarx">@smarx</a>) are doing on the podcast is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SO</strong></span> needed in the API space, I highly recommend subscribing to the podcast in your itunes and listening regularly.</p>
<p>I was honored to be critiqued in the podcast this week, where they &ldquo;gently&rdquo; disagreed with my post from earlier this week on my <a title="virtualized API stacks" href="/2013/01/28/virtualized-api-stacks/">speculation around virtual API stacks</a>.  So I wanted to &ldquo;gently&rdquo; respond and help clarify.</p>
<p>The first 60 seconds, pretty much sum up rebuttal, where they make my argument for me by saying <a href="http://ifttt.com">IFTT</a> and <a href="http://zapier.com">Zapier</a> are already doing this? Which is the whole basis for my story except I use <a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a> and <a href="http://temboo.com">Temboo</a> as examples.  All of these providers are in the same space in my opinion, I think maybe they are just referencing what they are familiar with (as John used to work at IFTTT).</p>
<p>Second they read in that I&rsquo;m envisioning some grand discovery language?  Not sure where this comes from.  I&rsquo;m just referencing that API providers can provide JSON definitions of their APIs, which <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is</span> happening with specs like Swagger, but not being done for discovery but for interactive documentation and code stub generation--the fact it is there is a plus for discovery.  But I have zero visions of there every being a grand &ldquo;standard&rdquo; for discovery, but I feel you can't argue Swagger is picking up momentum.</p>
<p>John and Steve also reference that I&rsquo;m calling for a &ldquo;standardized building blocks API providers can jump on?&rdquo;  Not sure where this comes from.  My arguement is that API will play almost no role in this process at all.  They won&rsquo;t give a shit or prepare in any way.  It will be 3rd party providers stepping up and building these abstracted platforms around existing API providers.  Something we are already seeing with Temboo, Singly and yes IFTTT and Zapier as well as BaaS providers like Kinvey, Parse, etc.</p>
<p>Then at the part they start talking about "API providers do not want to be commoditized", they lose me and deviate from anything I&rsquo;m talking about.  I agree that API providers don&rsquo;t want to be reduced to commodities.  This is just one possible path, and would not be for every API provider or reduce their existing retail relationship with developers.  We see it already happening with <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2012/07/25/sendgrid-partners-heroku-engine-yard-cloudbees/">SendGrid partners with Heroku, Engine Yard, &amp; others on email management</a>, and <a href="http://www.geekwire.com/2012/twilio-partners-windows-azure/">Twilio partners with Azure</a>.</p>
<p>So SendGrid won't be commoditized on Heroku? &nbsp;Twilio won't be commoditzed on Azure?</p>
<p>Google your favorite API by name and add partners with, you will see API providers do care about partnering and reselling themselves, which brings you very close to the commodities line when you resell at that level. &nbsp;What I'm suggesting could just be interpreted as reverse partnering, where a 3rd party platform integrates the API, rather than API seeking partnership--which we see with Singly, IFTT and Zapier, they don't ask for permission from every API provider.</p>
<p>While I listened further, the rest of the conversation had nothing to do with my post.  I blame my storytelling, as I&rsquo;m always trying to perfect how i articulate my visions and obviously I didn&rsquo;t clearly get my point across.  Since it was my first exploratory post on this subject, I will keep trying, and trying.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also have to call them out a bit, cause I heard standard over and over in the podcast, about building blocks, API interfaces and API definitions.  But if you look at my post I never even used the word standard or standardizing or anything.  So I think you guys read something that wasn&rsquo;t there, cause I am the last API guy who believes in standardizing in the web API space.</p>
<p>With that said, I fuck&rsquo;n love that you guys are doing this!  Makes me happy! &nbsp;Thanks John and Steve!</p>

        <span class="post-date">01 Feb 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://data.worldbank.org/" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/world-bank/The-World-Bank-Logo.png" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I had the pleasure of being on stage with <span>Tim Herzog (</span><a rel="user" href="http://twitter.com/tgherzog" target="_blank"><span class="at">@</span>tgherzog</a><span>)</span>, a Open Data Specialist from the <a title="World Bank" href="http://worldbank.com">World Bank</a> yesterday at the <a href="/2013/02/01/a-conversation-about-apis-in-washington-dc/">DC API meetup  at NPR</a>.  During the QA panel, at the end of the meetup, a question came from the audience, stating that open data from government is often boring, and thus is the reason much of what we see built on government isn't that exciting--alluding that there has to be more high value, exciting data that isn't being released.</p>
<p>While I agree that much of the data made available from open government initiatives is boring and stale, and there are probably much better datasets available, I also think this is more of a storytelling problem, than a data problem.  After the question was asked, I quickly answered by pointing to my left at Tim Herzog, and said the World Bank does an awesome job at this.</p>
<p>If you look through the <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/">World Bank data catalog</a>, and spend time looking through their blog, you see a symbiotic relationship between their open data, APIs and the stories they tell on the blog.  This approach is similar to what I'm calling <a title="Hacker Storytelling" href="http://hackerstorytelling.com">Hacker Storytelling</a>, the only difference is I am hosting all my stories on Github as individual repositories.</p>
<p>If you look at the home page of the World Bank data site today, there is a link to the blog post, "<a href="http://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/what-does-data-tell-us-about-debt-of-high-income-and-developing-countries">What does data tell us about debt of high income and developing countries?</a>"  This is a great example of not just providing a dataset, but actually telling the story around the data, while providing tools that let you interact with the data, making everything a very hands on experience--increasing the chances users will make an emotional connection with the data.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/what-does-data-tell-us-about-debt-of-high-income-and-developing-countries" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/world-bank/World-Bank-Exernal-Debt-to-GDP-Ratio.png" alt="" width="350" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>According to the blog post, the World Bank maintains two quarterly databases of information on external and public sector debt of many countries. The blog post narrates what the statistical data from the <a href="http://worldbank.org/qeds">Quarterly External Debt Statistics</a> (QEDS) and the <a href="http://worldbank.org/qpsd">Public Sector Debt Statistics</a> (PSD) databases tell us about trends in debt levels of some high income and developing countries, while also providing us with links to the data sets and JavaScript charts (using <a href="http://www.tableausoftware.com">Tableau Software</a>) we can play with, making the story an interactive, hands-on experience.</p>
<p>This is <a title="Hacker Storytelling" href="http://hackerstorytelling.com">Hacker Storytelling</a>.  It isn't just data.  It isn't just an API.  There is a story, giving the data context and meaning.  There are tools to help me play with the data, understand its value, with a link to the raw data for when I'm ready to get down to business.</p>
<p>I strongly believe that Hacker Storytelling is the solution to the boring data coming out of government, non-profit organizations and even in the private sector.  Hacker Storytelling is related to data journalism, but goes further, empowering anyone to publish a dataset and tell the story around it.  Not just journalists or programmers.</p>
<p>We need more open source tools that allow anyone to gather, curate and publish data, while also being able to wrap it in a story and bundle with interactive visualizations and tools that encourage exploration, remixing and sharing of these important stories that have the potential to solve real problems we face every day around the globe.</p>

        <span class="post-date">01 Feb 2013</span>

<p><a title="OpenKit" href="http://openkit.io/">A new player in the </a><a title="Backend as a Service" href="/trends/baas.php">Backend as a Service (BaaS)</a> space has emerged, from former <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenFeint">OpenFeint</a> co-founder Peter Relan--called <a title="OpenKit" href="http://openkit.io/">OpenKit</a>. &nbsp;The new BaaS platform is targeting game developers, providing cross-platform tools for both iOS and Android. &nbsp;The core features of the gaming BaaS platform are:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Cloud data sync</strong> - Save game progress in the cloud with data storage. Sync it across both iOS and Android devices for a consistent gaming experience</li>
<li><strong>Leaderboards</strong> - Drop-in leaderboard SDK's for both iOS and Android. Give your users the opportunity to compete against millions of other players</li>
<li><strong>Facebook &amp; Twitter auth </strong>- Users login with familiar third party social networks like Facebook and Twitter. No need to create and manage accounts. OpenKit handles it all</li>
<li><strong>Cross-platform support </strong>- OpenKit supports both iOS and Android. Our native SDKs are lightweight and will take just a few minutes to integrate into your game</li>
</ul>
<p>OpenKit represents a trend I&rsquo;m tracking on where people are pulling together specialized or <a title="virtualized stacks" href="/2013/01/28/virtualized-api-stacks/">virtualized stacks</a> targeting specific groups of developers.  Early movers in the space like Kinvey, Parse and Cloudmine have generally catered to all types of developers by providing them a backend stack, that assists them in rapidly building mobile and web apps. So naturally the next step is to see more specialized stacks, for smaller groups of developers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m stoked to see that OpenKit is completely <a href="https://github.com/openkit">open source, readily available on Github</a>, as well as comes out of the box with a REST API.  <a title="open source baas" href="/2012/08/28/open-source-mobile-backend-as-a-service/">Open source BaaS is something I was identifying was missing from the space</a>.</p>
<p>I will add OpenKit to my <a title="baas trends" href="/trends/baas.php">trends section for Backend as a Service</a>, where I&rsquo;m tracking on the BaaS space, and will dive in deeper and compare it with some of the other offerings we are seeing emerge.</p>

        <span class="post-date">01 Feb 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/dcapi-january/dcapi-1.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I came to Washington DC this week for meetings with a couple federal agencies and a handful of private companies who contract with our government--including a conversation last night at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/DC-Web-API-User-Group/events/97891662/">DC API Meetup Group</a>, which met at NPR offices downtown.</p>
<p>The API Meetup started with pizza, a healthy selection of beer and networking with around 50 API professionals and API curious from around the DC area.  I was able to meet about 15 folks I know online, but have never had the opportunity to connect with in real life.</p>
<p>Ben Balter (<a rel="user" href="http://twitter.com/BenBalter" target="_blank"><span class="at">@</span>BenBalter</a>), one of the Presidential Innovation Fellow (PIF) kicked off the conversation with a presentation of some of the cool API discovery, CSV to API, DB to API and various tool he's developed during his time as a innovation fellow.  I totally dig Ben's style, in making very small, but powerful open source tools that can make a real difference in how government opens up data via APIs.</p>
<p>I was up next, giving a talk titled, "<a href="/talks/apidays/business-models/">From Web, to Programmable Web, to Programmable World</a>".  I wanted to give everyone a healthy dose on the history of APIs, some views on where we are currently, and where API are going with an introduction to concepts like aggregation and automation.  The talk is meant to be a 200K foot walkthrough of the API space, which also reflects all of the sections available on <a href="http://apievangelist.com">APIEvangelist.com</a>.</p>
<p>Next up was Gray Brooks from the General Services Administration (GSA) who walked through some of the open data and API initiatives coming out of the federal government.  He is overseeing some very important aspects of the <a title="White House Digital Strategy" href="/federal_government.php">White House Digital Strategy</a>, and is the point person for the execution of the digital strategy across all federal agencies.</p>
<p>After Gray talked, Tim Herzog (<a rel="user" href="http://twitter.com/tgherzog" target="_blank"><span class="at">@</span>tgherzog</a>) the Open Data Specialist at the World Bank walked us through what the <a title="World Bank" href="http://www.worldbank.com">World Bank</a> is doing with their open data initiatives, which APIs are at the core.  He discussed how they couldn't have delivered their open data platform in the time and budget, without making it driven by APIs.</p>

<p>Last up was Javaun Moradi (<a rel="user" href="http://twitter.com/javaun" target="_blank"><span class="at">@</span>javaun</a>)&nbsp;of NPR, who walked us through some of the lessons learned from deploying and managing the NPR APIs.  His talk was full of nuggets of wisdom, including "Don't build an API unless it solves a user problem" and "We drink our own champagne, because we don't make dog food!".  I'm hoping to spend more time this spring, doing a deeper dive into the NPR approach and share those insights in blog posts and ultimately a white paper.</p>
<p>We wrapped up with the presentations, grabbed another beer, ate some more pizza and networked a bit--then came back for a QA panel with everyone who presented, moderated by Alex Howard (<a href="https://twitter.com/digiphile">@digiphile</a>) of O'Reilly Media.  Alex did an awesome job at making the panel a conversation with everyone in attendance, encouraging open questions from the audience on APIs.  Alex is extremely knowledgable on not just open data and APIs, but how Washington DC operates, there is no better person to moderate a panel in DC.</p>
<p>The DC API Meetup Group is something I will be coming back regularly to attend and hopefully have the opportunity to present again.  They are looking for speakers and sponsors for future events, so if you have anything you'd like to share or make sure your company supports these valuable API conversations, you can contact Patrick Svenburg (<a href="https://twitter.com/svenburg">@svenburg</a>), Head of Business Development &amp; Partnering at <a title="APIphany" href="http://apiphany.com">Apiphany</a> and organizer of the DC API Meetup Group.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/01/29/protecting-your-brand-with-api-branding-guidelines/">Protecting Your Brand With API Branding Guidelines</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">29 Jan 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://developer.active.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/Active-Network/power-by--drk.png" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>One of the top five concerns I hear from companies considering APIs is regarding losing control of their brand.  With APIs being about access to raw data and resources, companies immediately think that developers will extract the value, without any attribution or reference to the companies brand.</p>
<p>Even with this being a major concern, I see many APIs implement very poor branding guidelines, giving developers zero direction regarding how to properly provide attribution. &nbsp;This is a missed opportunity to not just protect the API providers brand, but actually extend it and increase its value.</p>
<p>With this in mind, I'm always on the lookout for good examples of API branding guidelines. &nbsp;One recent example I came across while monitoring my <a title="API Stack" href="http://theapistack.com">API Stack</a>, is from the <a title="Active Network" href="http://developer.active.com/">Active Network</a> which provides activity and outdoor content via their APIs.</p>
<p>Active Network starts with a great explanation of why they provide <a title="branding guidelines" href="http://developer.active.com/branding_guidelines">branding guidelines</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>At ACTIVE Network, we want you to be able to create fantastic applications with the ACTIVE Network APIs. At the same time, we don't want users to get confused about who is responsible for the data they are accessing, so we have some brand guidelines.</em></p>
<p>Next Active Network explains to developers why branding guidelines are important to their own users:</p>
<p><a href="http://developer.active.com/branding_guidelines" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/Active-Network/Active-Branding-Guidelines.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>The ACTIVE brand holds credibility in the mind of the customer.  It serves as a seal of approval giving customers the confidence to transact through a trusted source</li>
<li>As a consumer utility, ACTIVE.com&reg; captures and records registration activity providing people with a record of their personal registration history if they need it at a future date</li>
<li>Transacting for an ACTIVE powered activity, tells your customer who they need to call if they need help.  ACTIVE&rsquo;s standard of excellence provides customers with 24/7 support 365 days a year</li>
</ul>
<p>Active Network also provides details on how to properly use their companies name (which I followed in my story), what attribution is required, and a complete branding kit for download as a zip file--containing the following key assets:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Branding Guidelines in PDF Format</li>
<li>Icon Image</li>
<li>Powered by Logos</li>
<li>Register Now Buttons</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a title="Active Network Branding Guidelines" href="http://developer.active.com/branding_guidelines">Active Network Branding Guidelines</a> is one of the better implementations I've come across.  It provides a nice overview, with all of the details and assets needed to execute properly.</p>
<p>Even if you aren't concerned about your brand when it comes to your API, requiring some attribution from your developers will at least help you market and advertise your API, and potentially bring in new API consumers.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.app.net/2013/01/28/announcing-the-app-net-file-api/" target="_blank">App.net has just released a File API</a> to add to their messaging and communication stack, allowing any App.net account to natively store files via the social platform.</p>
<p>Each App.net account will be given a 10GB file storage area, allowing applications to read and write files, that can be linked and embedded within App.net communications.</p>
<p>This approach reminds me of what I&rsquo;m seeing within the <a title="backend as a service" href="/trends/baas.php">backend as a service (BaaS)</a> space with other common developer resources like user management, object storage and key-value stores.</p>
<p>App.net is just making sure developers have the resources they will need to be successful building web and mobile apps with the App.net API--a similar motivation for BaaS providers as wel as other API providers.</p>
<p>While many developers are fine with using multiple API providers to get what they need, I can see an opportunity to provide the essential resources developers will need within the primary API that they are building their app around.</p>
<p>As essential API resources are further commoditized, it seems like an opportunity for private label BaaS resources to emerge.  File storage could become something that any API provider could offer alongside their own resources, without having to reinvent the wheel each time.</p>
<p>Maybe such services already exist under other names, and I'm unaware of it, but it seems like a great opportunity for cloud providers to step up and offer private label, backend resources for API providers to integrate into their platforms.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/01/28/virtualized-api-stacks/">Virtualized API Stacks</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">28 Jan 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/Virtualized-API-Stacks.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>Up until now we tend to think of APIs individually--we approach integration in terms of the Twilio API, Twitter API or the Facebook API.  But as the number of <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory">public APIs has grown beyond 8K</a>, and an <a title="unknown amount of internal and partner APIs" href="/2013/01/24/estimating-the-number-of-non-public-apis/">unknown amount of internal and partner APIs</a> become available, we are seeing new patterns of <a title="aggregation" href="/trends/aggregation.php">aggregation</a> and <a title="interoperability" href="/trends/interoperability.php">interoperability</a> emerge from companies like <a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a>, but also seeing <a title="automation" href="/trends/automation.php">automation</a> be added into the mix by companies like <a title="Temboo" href="http://temboo.com">Temboo</a>, and entire backend stacks from providers like Parse.</p>
<p>These new aggregated or backend stacks of API driven resources can be as general as object and key-value stores, user management and other developer commodities we see <a title="backend as a service" href="/trends/baas.php">backend as a service providers</a> (BaaS) bring to the table, or they can be very personal like the photos Singly is aggregating across Flickr, Facebook and Instagram and with friends and followers across Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn.</p>
<p>As I see these new aggregate and BaaS providers emerge, at an ever increasing pace, I can&rsquo;t help but think--this still isn&rsquo;t fast enough (its my nature, you should try being me).  If I want common mobile developer resources I can adopt one of these new BaaS platforms like <a href="http://kinvey.com">Kinvey</a> or <a title="Parse" href="http://parse.com">Parse</a>, or if I need personal and social resources, which have <a title="fabric of mobile and web apps" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2012/11/13/the-api-fabric-for-next-generation-of-apps/">become part of the fabric of web and mobile apps</a>, I can go to Singly.  But what if I want a more specialized network, say just for <a title="education" href="http://hackeducation.com">education</a>?  I might need user management, object storage, key-value storage, access to commons social tools like friends and photos across multiple social networks, but I also need access to open courseware, teacher and student directories all via a very secure, auditable, efficient stack tailored just for K-12?  I will have to wait, for the next wave of startups to emerge.</p>
<p>While in NYC on Friday I had a great discussion with Temboo about virtualization.  Not just the virtualization we&rsquo;ve come to depend on with cloud computing--which is the virtualization of compute, storage, and database resources, but the <a title="virtualization of network resources" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_virtualization">virtualization of network resources</a> and <a title="software defined networking" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_networking">software defined networking</a>.  Companies like <a href="http://nicira.com/">Nicira</a>, <a href="http://www.pluribusnetworks.com/">Pluribus Networks</a>, <a href="http://www.anutanetworks.com/">Anuta Networks</a>, <a href="http://www.aristanetworks.com/en/solutions/network-virtualization">Arista</a>, <a href="http://www.vyatta.com/solutions/virtual">and Vyatta</a> are emerging with new products that are allowing the virtualization of networking resource into new and meaningful network stacks for any possible implementation that you can imagine.</p>
<p>After these conversation with the Temboo team, over the weekend I continued to think about the potential of virtualized API stacks.  Why can&rsquo;t I assemble my own API stack?  Why do I have to go to each API individually, or wait for new Singlys' to emerge in other verticals?  Why can&rsquo;t I assemble Parse, Singly, Twilio, Schoology, SendGrid into a virtualized API stack that provides not just ease of use, but the security I need to deploy a backend tailored just for K-12 education?</p>
<p>In this vision of the future, API providers could focus on what they do best, and not worry about every use case out there.  Providers like Singly, Temboo, Parse can build abstracted layers on top of this. With this abstraction I wouldn&rsquo;t be limited to just the friends and followers features on Twitter or Facebook, I could take advantage of the next generation of friend discovery tools like what Singly is delivering--in addition to the value of individual API providers.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/trends/interoperability-trends.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>With a virtualized approach, I could build the stack that is most meaningful for my internal, partner or public developers and if one piece of my stack is proving unreliable, I can replace it with another.  APIs resources would be further commoditized, required to provide JSON definitions of their interfaces (or die a quick death), which virtual API stack platforms could use to discover and offer API resources.  <a title="API Ranking" href="http://theapistack.com/ranking.html">API ranking</a> algorithms would emerge allowing anyone to make sure they were discovering, selecting and using the best of breed API resources in the areas that matter for any vertical.</p>
<p>With a virtualized API stack I could launch any specialized set of resources that I desired from the best of breed providers out there.  I could blend private and public resources together and in return offer them for use in private or public environments, further blurring the lines of what is an API and how they are consumed.</p>
<p>As we see APIs continue to become a driving force in government, healthcare and education and bridge the online and physical worlds via our <a title="automobiles" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/trends/automobiles.php">automobiles</a>, homes, <a title="buildings" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/trends/buildings.php">buildings</a> and further grow within healthcare via the <a title="quanitfied self" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/trends/quantified-self.php">quantified self</a>, potentially <a title="disrupt manufacturing with 3D printing" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/trends/3d-printing.php">disrupt manufacturing with 3D printing</a> and drive everything around us with the <a title="internet of things" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/trends/internet-of-things.php">internet of things</a>--the manual assembling of individual or even aggregated API stacks won&rsquo;t be enough.  We will need the ability to virtualize APIs stacks for any purpose within hours, not months or years.</p>

<p>API ecosystems are all about research &amp; development, and an opportunity for incubating ideas and apps in a way that invites 3rd party developers and companies to develop innovative ways of using your company assets and resources.  I&rsquo;ve discussed <a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2012/01/31/four-potential-levels-of-an-api-business-ecosystem/">incubation within an API ecosystem before,</a>&nbsp;and how companies are not just identifying developer talent and the best apps, but actually investing in companies via their API.</p>
<p>A new example of this in action is Nike's&nbsp;launch of their&nbsp;<a href="http://nikeaccelerator.com/index.html" target="_blank">Nike+ Accelerator</a>--a partnership with <a title="Techstars" href="http://www.techstars.com/">TechStars</a> that will host 10 companies for a three-month, immersive, mentor-driven startup accelerator designed to spur development on the&nbsp;<a href="http://developer.nike.com/">NikeFuel, the Nike+ FuelBand, and Nike+ Running API platform</a>.</p>
<p>The 10 partner companies will be given the following:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>$20,000</li>
<li>Access to the Nike+ APIs, Nike+ mobile SDKs, and Nike+ FuelBand Dev Kit (Beta) - you will be among the first in the world to receive this access</li>
<li>A Nike+ FuelBand for each team member</li>
<li>Tech support from experienced developers who've built companies, or built with Nike+ Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)</li>
<li>Code and solution reviews during the program</li>
<li>Mentor sessions with Nike executives and leaders in the start-up community</li>
<li>Two Investor Demo Days: one at the Nike World Headquarters and one in Silicon Valley</li>
<li>Real Access to Decision Makers</li>

<p>Then, at the end of the Nike+ Accelerator, each team will present to Nike executives, mentors, angel investors, venture capitalists, and tech industry leaders.</p>
<p>As an API publisher have you considered a built-in accelerator or incubation program within your API ecosystem?  And while I&rsquo;m at it, has your incubator or accelerator consider a partnership program tailored for API publishers?</p>

        <span class="post-date">24 Jan 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/Tag-Cloud-API-Discovery.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>For the last seven years, when you wanted to find an API you went to <a href="http://programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a>.  It has been the definitive way to discover new APIs, and responsible for all the buzz in the space that has gotten the industry to where it is.</p>
<p>Now that <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory">ProgrammableWeb is at 8400 APIs in its directory</a>, and adding 50-100 each week, it will continue to get even more difficult to discover APIs.  Even for someone like me who has looked at thousands of APIs, it can be very difficult and time consuming to find the API or APIs you are looking for.</p>
<p>In 2013 there are even more ways to find APIs, new approaches that are looking to define the next generation of API discovery and consumption.  Currently I&rsquo;m tracking on 4 API directories in addition to ProgrammableWeb:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="APihub" href="http://www.apihub.com/">APIhub</a></strong> - APIhub is the best way to publish, discover and consume APIs. Search our database or browse through our most popular APIs</li>
<li><strong><a title="APIs.io" href="http://apis.io/">APIs.io</a></strong> - APIS.io is an open source and free API registry service that allows developers to publish and discover REST APIs and interact with them online</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.exiconglobal.com/api-dir/">Exicon API Directory</a></strong> - Exicon helps marketers and enterprises find qualified developers through our online platform and advisory services</li>
<li><strong><a title="Mashape" href="https://www.mashape.com/">Mashape</a></strong> - Mashape provides a world-class marketplace to manage, distribute and consume both private and public APIs by developers from all over the world</li>
</ul>
<p>APIs.io and Exicon have the least amount of APIs available, but both Mashape and APIhub are currently leading, with Mashape possessing over 1500 and APIhub has over 13,000 APIs available.</p>
<p>In addition to providing the ability to search APIs and browse by category, these new generation of API directories are providing sophisticated tools like interactive documentation, code samples and ways to follow, share, like--providing social interactions for API developers with API publishers.</p>
<p>Beyond these new bells and whistles, what&rsquo;s next for API discovery?  To make developers lives easier they need programmatic ways to discover and understand APIs, as well as some sort of ranking to tell which are good and which are bad APIs.</p>
<p>To provide interactive documentation, these directories posses JSON definitions of each API interface, using formats such as <a title="Swagger" href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/11/09/can-swagger-deliver-a-restful-api-discovery-service/">Swagger</a> from Wordnik, which opens up the door for more sophisticated discovery in a programmatic way, and potentially directly from within your IDE.</p>
<p>With the  data from the sharing, liking, following, page views and other signals generated via these API directories, there is a potential to develop some sort of ranking.  But we need more data signals from the space to truly develop a meaningful ranking.  I&rsquo;ve developed <a title="API Ranking" href="http://theapistack.com/ranking.html">my own API ranking</a> to help me discover which APIs are trending based upon internal and external signals, allowing me to establish my <a href="http://apistack.com">API Stack</a>.  But its not enough either.  We need a lot more to be able to establish a meaningful way to rank APIs, that truly benefits developer efforts.</p>
<p>As we are switching from showcasing the quantity of APIs, to better understanding the value and quality of APIs, we are going to need a new breed of directories.  I&rsquo;m excited by what I&rsquo;m seeing from these new API directories, and hopeful for what is coming 2013.</p>

<p>If you are in Washington DC, make sure and come by and join in the API conversation, and say hello.</p>
<p>I find myself talking APIs in Washington D.C. more than any other city, except for San Francisco. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Which is a good thing! &nbsp;Its one of the most important places we need to be having API discussions, so its good to see the energy from folks. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Google is migrating samples and tools for App Engine, BigQuery, Compute Engine, Cloud SQL, and Cloud Storage to a new Github account, they are calling the <a title="Google Cloud Platform" href="http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2013/01/find-sample-code-and-more-for-google.html">Google Cloud Platform</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/googlecloudplatform">Google is going all in with its use of Github</a>, something I'm encouraging API owners to do.  They are working to manage all of their essential API tools there like their start projects, which show developers how to get started with Google APIs as well as other helper tools like the OAuth 2.0 Helper, that helps developers be successful.</p>
<p>Github provides a lot of benefit beyond the obvious aspect of open sourcing your code.  Google is actively engaging with developers using Github alongside all of these open source projects.  If you think about it, this offers a more compelling way to engage with API developers beyond forums.  On forums you end up with a lot of general, sometimes senseless questions--Github anchors questions or issues and pull requests around actual code libraries, SDKs, starter kits and other integration areas.</p>
<p>Github provides potentially more meaningful actions to occur between you and your developer community, beyond making code more accessible and openly licensed.  It is good to see Google going this route.</p>

        <span class="post-date">24 Jan 2013</span>
        <p><a title="SDK Bridge" href="http://sdkbridge.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-service-providers/sdk-bridge/SDKBridge-logo.gif" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><em>This post comes from the&nbsp;<a title="SDK Bridge" href="http://sdkbridge.com/">SDK Bridge</a>&nbsp;newsletter. &nbsp;I find so much value from what Peter and Jonathan do over at SDK Bridge, I always have to post their newsletter here and share with all of you.</em></p>
<p>ProgrammableWeb is known for publishing the number of public APIs in its directory, and they regularly present an impressive&nbsp;<a href="http://sdkbridge.createsend1.com/t/r-l-utikkyk-hdhyyhjli-j/" target="_blank">graph</a>&nbsp;that shows how this number has increased exponentially over time. However, not all APIs are public, and ProgrammableWeb is not able to obtain information on how many non-public APIs exist.</p>
<p>SDK Bridge writes API documentation as a service, and many of our customers have us document their non-public APIs. That puts us in a unique position to be able to estimate what percentage of APIs is public compared to non-public.</p>
<h3>Definitions</h3>
<p>What exactly is a non-public API? For the purposes of this article, let's define a few terms.</p>
<p><strong>Public API.</strong>&nbsp;A public API is an API where the documentation is freely available on the Web. Using the API may require registering and paying a fee.</p>
<p><strong>Partner API.</strong>&nbsp;A partner API is an API where the documentation is not made available to the public, but is made available to select companies who have some kind of partnership agreement with the API provider. Typically the documentation is accessible through a password-protected website.</p>
<p><strong>Internal API.</strong>&nbsp;An internal API is an API that is only used by developers who work for the company that provides the API. Typically the documentation is available only on an internal website.</p>
<h3>Data</h3>
<p>Since its inception in 2008, SDK Bridge has written documentation for 23 web APIs. (Web APIs are only a portion of the writing that we do for software professionals. We also write SDK documentation, IT documentation, and training curricula, as well as create video tutorials for developers.) Of these APIs, 12 were public, 9 were partner, and 2 were internal. The following pie chart shows the breakdown:</p>
<table style="padding-left: 200px;" align="center">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="center" valign="bottom"><img src="https://i6.createsend1.com/ei/r/97/AC3/A0A/061035/nonpublicapipie.png" alt="" /></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Web API documentation by type.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>For the non-public APIs (partner and internal), it's interesting to note that 82% were RESTful and 18% were SOAP APIs. Also, 91% supported XML formats and 18% supported JSON formats. This suggests that non-public APIs have mostly made the transition from SOAP to REST, but have largely not made a transition from XML to JSON.</p>
<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>Our data analysis indicates that roughly half of web APIs are not public. Two factors to consider:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>The sample size is still fairly small. As time goes on and we get a larger sample size, we will improve the accuracy.</li>
<li>Companies may be less inclined to hire outside writers for non-public APIs than for public APIs. This means that our data could easily result in an underestimation of non-public APIs.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, for now, if you are looking for a rough estimation of the total number of APIs, you can take the number published by ProgrammableWeb and double it.</p>

<p><a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/01/transparency-report-what-it-takes-for.html">Google released an update to the Transparency Report today</a>, showing information regarding government requests for users' data on the Google Network.</p>
<p>Google's transparency report proves details on Government requests including who they come from, where the requests originate, types of requests and other critical information about how our government monitor us citizens and ultimately the entire world online.</p>
<p>There are <a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/01/23/google-releases-new-government-surveillance-data-facebook-stays-mum/">stories on other blogs that state Facebook and other platforms should follow Google's lead with transparency reports</a> of their own.  I agree.  We will never see our government mandate industry leaders to do this, so us people have to lobby corporations to follow Google's lead.</p>
<p>I see this type of transparency being critical to any company claiming they have an "open platform" or "open APIs".  I will be adding transparency report to my list of <a title="legal building blocks for API owners" href="http://www.apievangelist.com/buildingblocks/">legal building blocks for all API owners</a>.</p>
<p>As more and more of our world, economy and daily lives moves online and are transmitted via APIs, investigations by our legal system and government are only going to grow.  We need to establish a way to report on these inquiries in real-time and in an open way like Google has been doing for two years now.</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Jan 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://hackerstorytelling.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/hacker-storytelling/Tag-Cloud-Hacker-Storytelling.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I love to write.  My girlfriend has really help me kindle this passion.  Thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters/">@audreywatters</a>.</p>
<p>After 2.5 years of telling stories on <a href="http://apievangelist.com/">API Evangelist</a>, I&rsquo;ve gotten pretty good at organizing my ideas, and putting out stories that showcase the best (and worst) from the Business of APIs.  I&rsquo;ve gotten so efficient at it in 2012, I even launched <a href="http://apievoice.com/">API Voice</a> which is dedicated to the politics of APIs, <a href="http://theapistack.com">the API Stack</a> which is dedicated to top APIs and <a href="http://hackweekends.com/">Hack Weekends</a> which is all about hackathons.</p>
<p>When I meet people in the real world, I often hear, &ldquo;You sure blog a lot, I see like 5 posts a day coming from you!&rdquo;  I do write a lot, but it comes in waves.  I tend to write a lot of stories all at once, pumping out 15-20 pieces and then I trickle them out across the appropriate domain over the next couple days.</p>
<p>In 2013, I&rsquo;m going to get even more efficient with my storytelling, with an evolved approach I&rsquo;m calling <a href="http://hackerstorytelling.com/">Hacker Storytelling</a>.</p>
<p>The process is based upon dwhat I already do, but uses a new blend of:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Pages</strong> - HTML, CSS and text that frames a site, project or research</li>
<li><strong>Blogs</strong> - Chronological blog posts that walk through a project or research</li>
<li><strong>Presentations</strong> - Deck.js presentations that walk through a project or research</li>
<li><strong>Data</strong> - JSON, XML or database stores that drive the essence of a story</li>
<li><strong>APIs</strong> - Simple, data and representations derived from APIs</li>
</ul>
<p>I use these formats to tell stories across my blog, but in 2012 I learned some new techniques with existing and new technology that &nbsp;I have discovered, and will be employing a series of technologies that help me better deliver stories:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://pages.github.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Github Pages</strong></a> - A quick, easy and lightweight way to host websites on Github allowing anyone to build site with HTML, CSS and Javascript.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll#readme" target="_blank"><strong>Jekyll</strong></a> - Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory (representing the raw form of a website), runs it through Textile or Markdown and Liquid converters, and spits out a complete, static website.</li>
<li><a href="http://pages.github.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Mustache Templates</strong></a> - A simple way to render structured data from JSON files, using basic HTML templates for displaying--instead of pulling directly from database.</li>
<li><a href="http://pages.github.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Deck.js</strong></a> - A JavaScript library for building modern HTML presentations. deck.js is flexible enough to let advanced CSS and JavaScript authors craft highly customized decks, but also provides templates and themes for the HTML novice to build a standard slideshow.</li>
</ul>
<p>By default all of my projects start as a Github repository with a base Github Pages + Jekyll implementation I&rsquo;ve setup for my API Evangelist brand.   This will force me to be open and transparent by default.  I know this reality isn&rsquo;t meant for everyone, but for me, I hate seeing many of my projects never leave the firewall and end up being deleted from an Amazon EC2 instance in the dungeon of my IT network.</p>
<p>All my projects will become <a title="Hacker Storytelling" href="http://hackerstorytelling.com">Hacker Storytelling</a> projects.  Some will have a single page, while others will have blogs, presentations and simple or complex data driven tools that help support the story.</p>
<p>Currently I have four projects who live in this new format and are hosted entirely on Github:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://theapistack.com">The API Stack</a></li>
<li><a title="Hack Weekends" href="http://hackweekends.com">Hack Weekends</a></li>
<li><a title="Hack Weekends Guide" href="http://guide.hackweekends.com">Hack Weekends Guide</a></li>
<li><a href="http://digitalstrategy.apievangelist.com">Digital Strategy</a></li>
</ul>
<p>My goal is to be open by default, when it comes to content and data and make sure I share all of my ideas, in the widest and most shareable and remixable way possible.  My objective during my time on earth is to tell stories and write code that will make change, no matter how small.</p>
<p>I believe that <a title="Hacker Storytelling" href="http://hackerstorytelling.com">Hacker Storytelling</a> will help me do this!  I hope it will help you too!</p>

Giving them access to upcoming Google Drive SDK features and the opportunity to provide feedback.</p>
<p>Google isn't accepting everyone--they will be screening applicants based upon the type and quality of the application, number of users, and ability to implement and provide feedback on new features as they're made available.</p>
<p>An early access program seems like a good idea for API owners.  It gives you the chance to test out your alpha and beta APIs, client libraries, SDK's with a controlled audience, before you release them out into the wild.</p>
<p>With the number of developers Google has, I don't think it will be a problem getting developers to sign up.  But it seems like something you could even pay developers for, if you have a shortage of good developers in your API ecosystem.</p>
<p>An early access program fits right into earlier stories I've done on <a title="possible developer incentive ladders within API ecosystems" href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/10/24/incentivize-your-api-developers-to-contribute-with-lower-pricing/index.php">possible developer incentive ladders within API ecosystems</a>.</p>

<p>WSO2's <a title="open source API management platform" href="http://wso2.com/products/api-manager">open source API management platform</a> for creating, managing, consuming and monitoring APIs, now has the ability to track API usage through Google Analytics.</p>
<p>Since APIs are deployed using HTTP, the same transport we are using for websites, it makes sense that we should be able to see statistics for both our websites and APIs, side-by-side using Google Analytics.</p>
<p>After creating a new profile for your API in Google Analytics you can put the tracking code into your WSO2 API Management interface and begin seeing real-time or standard (24 hour) reporting on API traffic in the Google Analytics interface.</p>
<p>Since Google Analytics has an API and widgets, you will be able to use this data easily in other reports or system integrations that may need access to your API usage data.</p>
<p>It is great to see innovation around API analytics and reporting, beyond the standard dashboards we've seen from most providers.

<p>It has been a while since I provided an update on the White House Digital Strategy. &nbsp;I <a href="/federal_government.php">monitor the progress of federal agencies participation programmatically</a>, using JSON reports published by each agency at the agencies domain, /digitalstrategy.</p>
<p>After running the script today, I notice 20 federal agencies with active footprints. &nbsp;There are about five more, but there are issues with the JSON version of their digital stratgies--I really want to focus on the programmatic value. So, across these 20 agencies I find 76 data API initiatives&nbsp;and 75 mobile API projects.</p>
<p>To bring you up to speed, there are two specific milestones in the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-government-strategy.pdf">Digital Government Strategy</a> that specifically address API deployment:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>2.2 (Data) -</strong> Make high-value data and content in at least existing two major customer-facing systems available through web APIs, apply metadata tagging and publish a plan to transition additional high-value systems</li>
<li><strong>7.2 (Mobile) -</strong> Optimize at least two existing priority customer-facing services for mobile use and publish a plan for improving additional existing services&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>To help shed light on where these progressive agencies are going with both their data and mobile intiatives I wanted to break them out into separate groups, for each agency.</p>

<li> <strong>ExoAPI</strong> - ExoAPI is an ongoing project that extends the accessibility of exoplanetary data by providing an easy to use RESTful API. ExoAPI was created during the NASA Space Apps Challenge by a team of three amazing geniuses who knew nothing about space before they started this...and still don't really. Currently the data is provided by http://exoplanetology.blogspot.com/ who in turn feeds the data from http://exoplanet.eu/. The ExoAPI team plans on extending the API to encompass a wider array of data sources and more interesting space data to reach as many programmers as possible and encourage an explosion of space data based mashups. </li>

<p>Finding APIs that compliment your API, and talking about the mutual benefits is nothing new.  When I worked with the <a href="http://mimeo.com">print API Mimeo</a>, I would write code that used Mimeo API in conjunction with <a title="Box API" href="http://developer.mimeo.com/blog/blog_detail.php?ID=91">Box API</a> or <a href="http://developer.mimeo.com/blog/blog_detail.php?ID=223">Dropbox API</a>.  Mashing up or bundling your APIs with other complimentary service can really help, when you are trying to explain the value your API delivers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m beginning to see patterns of even deeper integration and partnerships between APIs emerge--where one API provider will resell the API of another provider. &nbsp;APIs partnering with other APIs isn&rsquo;t that new, but reselling of each others API services to their developers is a fairly new concept, providing a potential new wholesale channel for API providers.</p>
<p>One recent example of this is in a recent <a title="partnership between Singly and Cloudmine" href="http://blog.singly.com/2012/11/12/teaming-up-with-cloudmine-for-backend-superpowers/">partnership between Singly and Cloudmine</a>.  Cloudmine is a <a title="BaaS Provider" href="/trends/baas.php">BaaS provider</a>, and Singly is provider of personal and social data via <a title="aggregate APIs" href="/trends/aggregation.php">aggregate APIs</a>. With the reseller approach, Cloudmine developers get a vastly improved stack to develop against, with <a href="https://cloudmine.me/">Cloudmine</a> providing all the essential BaaS tools developers are growing accustomed to, while also having access to 30+ social, personal and other aggregate API services provide by <a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a>.</p>
<p>The goal of this new approach is to provide developers with the most meaningful stack possible, in a single developer area.   A <a href="http://www.mogreet.com/">MMS API provider like Mogreet</a> could in theory, to better serve their developers, bundle image APIs like Flickr, Instagram and Facebook from Singly into their API area--providing a more robust stack to their developers who are building media enabled mobile apps.</p>
<p>Now developers don&rsquo;t have to traverse to each API area on their own.  APIs can mashup, bundle and develop a stack, which includes their own APIs, but might also have APIs from potentially several other API providers. &nbsp; Obviously there are lots of details to work out around authentication, pricing, etc., but the potential is obvious.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also talking with a linguistics API provider in Europe, and learning more about their partner program, which would allow for 3rd party API providers to submit APIs and sell alongside their own linguistics API. &nbsp;Opening up their API stack for new opportunities and innovation from 3rd party linguistics API providers--in languages, formats they wouldn't have resources to do themselves.</p>
<p>As the number of APIs are growing, and we are seeing APIs aggregate via providers like Singly and through BaaS providers like Cloudmine, I think we&rsquo;ll see individual APIs become more portable, allowing them to be assembled into meaningful API stacks for developers. &nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Jan 2013</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/markdown-icon.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I just posted a story on <a title="how I like the Guardian&rsquo;s approach to data journalism" href="http://kinlane.com/2013/01/17/the-guardian-is-brilliant-in-supporting-relevant-events-with-open-data/">how I like the Guardian&rsquo;s approach to data journalism</a>, and spending time evolving on last nights <a title="Markup APIs" href="/2013/01/16/markup-apis-and-api-scripting-platforms/">thoughts about the possibilities of Markup APIs</a>.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;m <a href="http://kinlane.com/2013/01/02/all-side-projects-are-now-hosted-on-github/">migrating much of the front-end of my websites to run on a home brew of Github Pages, Jekyll and JSON fueled Mustache Templates</a>, I am seeing more of the potential of not just Markup APIs, but Markdown APIs that will run in a purely client side environment.</p>
<p>Imagine if I could go to a provider like the Guardian, US Census or other high value data provider, grab a link to a Markdown API JavaScript file that is relevant to a story or report you are working on. &nbsp;With this Markdown API I would be given a whole dictionary of markdown you could use.</p>
<p>An example would be, that when I wanted the 2010 population for New York City, I could just write [population|New York|NY|US|2010], or something like that and would print out the actual population for that year in NYC, with a link to the source.  Each time I used a markdown API it would add some sort of attribution to the source at the bottom of document.</p>
<p>Seems like we&rsquo;d establish trusted, centralized sources of information, allowing anyone (even non-developers) to put open data and APIs to use via easy to implement markup or markdown APIs.</p>
<p>Think of the potential if facts around the web actually had the backing of trusted sources, and were able to be embedded anywhere on the web, via apps or digital documents.</p>
<p>It would be fun to create a markup and markdown API for API Evangelist, with a dictionary of terms, facts and other data that were relevant to the API industry.</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Jan 2013</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.emergentone.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/serviceproviders/emergent-one-logo.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.emergentone.com/" target="_blank">Emergent One</a>, one of the newest <a href="/2012/06/15/api-service-provider-roundup-for-2012/" target="_blank">API management players</a> on the block, just announced a new free development tier.</p>
<p>The Emergent One platform provides simple, cloud-based tools for connecting to your MySQL or PostgreSQL database, and quickly generating an API from your database.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t sign up for their service when they first launched, because they didn&rsquo;t have a free tier, and I&rsquo;m unwilling to put in credit cards and commit to brand new services. This is something I have problem with from running development and IT teams who use a wide variety of cloud services.  I would spend a great deal of time each month chasing down charges and other issues from cloud services that were being experimented with.</p>
<p>The Emergent One approach to deploying APIs from common data sources, is one I think will resonate with users who aren&rsquo;t developers, but understand the importance of APIs, and are often restrained by unresponsive, limited or no IT resources.</p>
<p><a href="https://emergentapi.com/cp/register?type=internal" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/emergent-one/Emergent-One-Get-Started.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Emergent One one is responding to user requests for a cheaper tier that support entry level API users, which will allow them to tweak their API strategies before spending money.  This is something I think is mandatory for all API service providers, something <a href="http://3scale.net/">3Scale</a> were the first movers on, and we have seen <a href="http://apigee.com/about/pricing">Apigee</a> implement recently, as well as&nbsp;<a href="/serviceproviders/layer_7_technologies.php" target="_blank">Layer7</a> with their <a href="http://www.apify.co/" target="_blank">Apify</a>.</p>
<p>I notice that in the email announcement of the 100% free tier, it encourages me to build new APIs at no cost, <strong><em>&ldquo;until launch&rdquo;</em></strong>.  I hope Emergent One will agree that a entry level pricing tier is not critical for users to get to know Emergent One, but essential for educating the masses about the value of APIs--allowing them to experiment. So le'ts please make sure it isn&rsquo;t only until launch.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m setting up some APIs, directly from one of my Amazon RDS instances. &nbsp; I'll let you know when ready.</p>

<p>I am a big fan of APIs that do one thing and do it well, like <a href="http://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a>.  I had lunch with the team from a similar API yesterday, called <a title="Mogreet" href="https://developer.mogreet.com/">Mogreet</a>.</p>
<p><a title="Mogree API" href="https://developer.mogreet.com/">The Mogreet API</a> lets you send and receive text or multimedia messages and use the platform to transcode, host and send video, audio and images for your web or mobile application.</p>
<p>When you think of the popularity of Instagram, the rebirth of Flickr and the ubiquitous value of photos and images online, it just makes sense that MMS is going to play a critical role in mobile app development in 2013.</p>
<p>I have a daughter, who sometimes responds to my SMS, email, chats and facebook messages.  Her attention span doesn&rsquo;t include always responding to her dad in "his" preferred formats. While she was visiting lately I sat on couch and watched her interact with friends and use her iPhone.   I noticed she communicated mostly in photos.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.mogreet.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/mogreet/mogreet-api-mms.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>She communicates by taking photos and sending them, tweaking or distorting them and writing messages before sending, and spent a lot of time surfing and sharing silly photos from around the web--all in a social way via her smart phone.</p>
<p>A picture is worth a thousand words.  I'm not good at math, but that seems 6x more valuable than a Tweet.</p>
<p>When you start thinking about which killer features will emerge in our mobile apps this year, I&rsquo;m sure the majority will depend on photos or videos, making MMS a pretty critical API resources to have in your developers toolbox.</p>
<p>After taking a look at Mogreet, I predict we will see them fueling the next crop of meaningful mobile apps, much like Twilio has done for the last two years.</p>

        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/scripting-platforms/markup-api.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>Over the holidays I added a <a title="new section to API Evangelist called trends" href="http://apievangelist.com/trends/">new section to API Evangelist called "trends</a>".  One of the areas I&rsquo;m tracking on is what I&rsquo;m calling &ldquo;<a href="/trends/scripting-platforms.php">scripting platforms</a>&rdquo;.  While you can program against any API using the language of your choice, these platforms are aggregating APIs and make available through a custom language stack.</p>
<p>This approach is different than what I&rsquo;m seeing from <a title="aggregate APIs" href="/trends/aggregation.php">aggregate APIs</a> like <a title="Singly" href="http://singly.com">Singly</a>.  Scripting platforms may offer aggregate APIs, but are also providing a way to easily script against them, in new and abstracted ways.  I&rsquo;m <a href="/2012/12/19/taking-apis-to-next-level-with-api-scripting-platforms/">still trying to understand each company</a>, as well as the nuances between each approach--so stay tuned.</p>
<p>In the last couple weeks, I&rsquo;m seeing a possible new approach to programming against APIs come into focus, one that is using HTML instead of scripting--using Markup APIs.</p>
<p>After reading <a title="Building Bridges Between GUIs and Code With Markup APIs" href="http://www.toolness.com/wp/2013/01/building-bridges-between-guis-and-code-with-markup-apis/">Building Bridges Between GUIs and Code With Markup APIs</a> by Atul Varma (<a href="https://twitter.com/toolness">@toolness</a>) from Mozilla, you can really start seeing not just the potential around rich media and content like Mozilla is with its <a href="https://webmaker.org/en-US/">Webmaker platform</a>, but deliver any API resource in abstracted, simplified markup anyone can put to use--without knowing programming.</p>
<p>Lyre Calliope takes this further discussing how, &ldquo;Webmaker could be an opportunity to define an embeddable API strategy for the entire web&rdquo;, and that &ldquo;a Singly Markup API would lower the learning threshold for anyone interested in remixing all of their personal information together in new ways&rdquo;, in&nbsp;<a href="http://captaincalliope.net/2013/01/15/markup-apis-and-the-readwrite-web/">Markup APIs and the Read/Write Web</a>.</p>
<p>I envision Markup APIs, at their simplest working like <a href="http://mustache.github.com/">Mustache Templates</a> where you can easily render data from JSON templates, or be as robust as what Mozilla is doing with their Webmaker platform. &nbsp;Making the web embeddable and remixable like Lyre says.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While scripting platforms are providing an important evolution in APIs for developers, by aggregating top APIs into new resources, the Markup API approach is an interesting evolution in APIs for everyone. &nbsp;And with <a href="https://singly.com/docs/data/authorization#Browser-based-Client-Apps">browser based authentication solutions like Singly's</a>, we can make this a very personalized experience.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still working to understand all the possibilities, but I think both API scripting platforms and Markup APIs will bring us closer to a truly programmable web that is acceptable by everyone.</p>

        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/google/Google-Voter-Information-Widget.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>I stumbled across the <a href="https://developers.google.com/civic-information/">Google Civic Information API</a> today, which allows developers to build applications around civic information including polling place, early vote location, candidate data, and election official information.  As soon as I landed on the home page, I scanned the left hand navigation, and noticed the option for "<a href="https://developers.google.com/civic-information/docs/embed">embeddable tool</a>".</p>
<p>As you know <a href="http://apievangelist.com/blog/tag.php?Search_Tag=Embeddable">embeddable tools are are something I advocate all API owners</a> should consider when assembling the building blocks of your API.  I like Google's approach to the Google Voter Information Tool, which lets users look up their polling place, early vote sites, ballot, and election official information for the US 2012 General Election.</p>
<p>To support the embeddable tool, Google provides a quick overview, with instructions for "quick embed" and more granular options allowing anyone to configure region, address, local and other advanced settings.</p>
<p>Even though the 2012 election is over, I think Google's approach to providing embeddable tools with their APIs is potentially something that other API owners can follow, which will make your API accessible beyond just the developer community.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Jan 2013</span>

<p>The mission of API Evangelist is centered around telling stories from the API space, shedding light on the innovative things developers and API providers are doing across all business sectors.</p>
<p>Over the holidays I rolled my <a title="History of APIs" href="/history/">history of APIs series into its own section</a>.  It can be very difficult to understand who the players were in the API game, last year, let alone 10 years ago.  If there aren&rsquo;t stories about what happened in 2001, it can be very difficult to piece together the history.</p>
<p>In 2012 I also scaled up my API monitoring system to track the blogs and tweets of over 1000 APIs, providing a way for me to track activity across the space and establish my own <a title="API Ranking System" href="http://theapistack.com/ranking.html">API ranking system</a> resulting in what I cal&nbsp;<a title="The API Stack" href="http://theapistack.com">the API Stack</a>.  This too is very dependent on API owners telling or sharing stories around their operations.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m tracking on over 1500 APIs and only 1000 have blogs and Twitter accounts.  With very few other signals to follow, such as stories in the blogosophere, social bookmarks on Hacker News and Reddit or QA on Quora or Stack Overflow--there isn&rsquo;t much to discover about these potentially valuable APIs.</p>
<p>At first, I felt there was a flaw in the way I track on APIs.  If an API offers value, but there are no stories for me to track on, it won&rsquo;t show up on my radar--leaving me feeling my approach could be flawed.</p>
<p>On the flip side, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/12/27/new-api-stories-in-2013/">going into 2013 I am eager to find &ldquo;new&rdquo; stories of APIs,</a> feeling like I&rsquo;m constantly telling stories of Amazon and Netflix--contrasting this with the lack of stories around 500 of my APIs, I felt there is an important link.  There is a reason I tell so many stories about Netflix isn't chance, it is because Netflix shares so much about its operations, providing fuel for my analysis and storytelling.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/netflix/daniel-jacobson-netflix.JPG" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>To shed light on this, I sat down with Daniel Jacobson (<a href="https://fr.twitter.com/daniel_jacobson">@daniel_jacobson</a>), Director of Engineering for APIs at Netflix and asked him, <strong><em>&ldquo;Why does Netflix share so many stories about their operations?&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
<p>It is very similar to why I tell stories on API Evangelist. &nbsp;Daniel asys it can be very positive to think about things, anticipating that you will share publicly, forcing you to see things in a different light.  That process can be very healthy, even without considering the after-effects of publicly sharing.</p>
<p>Ultimately Netflix shares its stories publicly to set itself as a thought leader, providing a marketing vehicle for the company when stories get picked up by TechCrunch or Mashable, but also sending signals to the world that Netflix is innovating and is a great place to work--additionally providing a valuable talent acquisition engine in a time when competition for talent is high.  <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2012/05/15/why-rest-keeps-me-up-at-night/">Look at posts from Daniel, on sites like ProgrammableWeb</a>.  What do you see in the last sentence...&rdquo;<a href="http://jobs.netflix.com/jobsListing.html?function=Engineering">we are hiring</a>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next I asked Daniel how, or if they measure and reported on the return on investment (ROI) from their public storytelling--number of hires, pageviews, syndication, etc.  He providing me with another link to talent acquisition--that ultimately they don&rsquo;t track on this, its based upon the response they get publicly and the feeling in their gut after each story is released into the wild.</p>
<p>Daniel related this approach to strorytelling with their internal <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664">culture of freedom and responsibility</a>.  When you work at Netflix, there is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span> a lot of management and control, the culture is centered around good judgement, communication, impact, curiosity, innovation, courage, passion, honesty and selflessness.  In my opinion all qualities that can lead to good storytelling.</p>
<p>The Netflix storytelling process isn&rsquo;t a PR stunt.  Its truly about a genuine desire to share the story of their operations, the successes and failures--demonstrating their expertise and thought leadership not just in the movie and TV industry, but across the technology sector.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/netflix/netflix-reed-hastings.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>API Evangelist is my learning and storytelling platform.  It is rooted in my learning in real-time, and my desire to share these thoughts, in hopes others can learn along with me.  I&rsquo;m not seeking pageviews, I just want to share my view of the space, showcase the good and bad across all sectors, helping lead, in hopes that I can contribute to making the space as healthy as possible.</p>
<p>As an API provider, your blog, social networks, QA and forum activity is not just a PR mouthpiece.  It is how you will tell the stories around your platform, how you will share the value you deliver--educating users, developers and the public at large that you exist, and that what you are doing matters.</p>
<p>Without stories, your platform won&rsquo;t matter now or in the future--no matter how amazing your technology is.</p>

After finding a new date for the event on February 21st and 22nd, we've gone through the session and speaker lineup and almost the entire line-up is coming back, with a couple of new entries including a new keynote from&nbsp;Jeff Lawson of Twilio.</p>
<p>We had a whole bunch of new requests for speaker additions over the holidays, and while we tried to squeeze in where we could, with such a killer lineup and the fact that everyone was committed to the new dates, we had to decline some pretty good talks.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/api-strategy-practice-conference/api-strategy-home-1.png" alt="" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Over the next week we are going through and confirming with all registered attendees to verify they will be attending, but since the event was sold out before hurricane Sandy, I expect we will be announcing the event as sold out pretty soon.</p>
<p>The event is designed to be an intimate 2 days between 300 industry professionals in the API space. &nbsp;So I recommend if you are excited about APIs in 2013, make sure and head over to <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/" target="_blank">API Strategy &amp; Practice site</a> and register before its 100% sold out.</p>

        <span class="post-date">01 Jan 2013</span>
        <p><em>After looking back at 2012, I wanted a January 1, 2013 blog post for my blogs.  My first blog post of 2012 was my tour schedule for January, 2012.  While it was a pretty busy time for evangelizing and hackathons, I wanted something a little deeper.  I&rsquo;m not sure what, but I will play with the format year to year, until I find what I&rsquo;m looking for.</em></p>
<p><em>Every year I rewrite my bio, based upon where I am.  I&rsquo;ve been doing this since 2009.   This year I will write inaugural blog posts along with my bio rework, and post to each of my active blogs.  We&rsquo;ll see if it resonates again in 12 months and I do it again in 2014.</em></p>

<p>I started API Voice because I believe the politics of APIs is one of the most important areas that will make or break the API space.  APIs are not just technical.  There are a wide range of political issues facing companies when it comes to APIs.</p>
<p>The politics of APIs can range from terms of service issues to potential government regulation.  We are seeing the politics of APIs play out in the Twitter ecosystem and in the U.S. legal system with Oracle vs. Google.</p>
<p>My understanding of the politics of APIs still evolving.  I started API Voice in May 2012 to help me understand it more.  I&rsquo;m still trying to quantify all the areas, but so far the politics of APIs can include terms of use, data portability, branding, privacy, business models, service level agreements (SLA), acquisitions, copyright, regulation, patent and the ubiquitous, magical term &ldquo;open&rdquo;.</p>
<p>When I started <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, I wanted to provide a platform for research into the business of APIs.  Over two years I&rsquo;ve begun to solidify some perspective on the space, and form clear opinions around potential best practices.  With API Voice, I want to do the same for the politics of APIs.</p>
<p>At this point, all I can do is write about things as they unfold--as APIs are acquired and as they make the terms of service changes that impact developers.  API Voice is in its infancy, and I will be working to cover as many of what unfolds in 2013 as I can.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t help but feel that 2013 is going to be a big year when it comes to the politics of APIs.</p>

        <p><em>After looking back at 2012, I wanted a January 1, 2013 blog post for my blogs.  My first blog post of 2012 was my tour schedule for January, 2012.

<p>API Evangelist is my obsession.  I started the blog in summer of 2012, in an effort to reinvent myself and find a career path that didn&rsquo;t just make sense for me, but also was something that would be around in a couple, while also returning something to society.</p>
<p>I believe API Evangelist is on course to do just this.  While focusing on the business of APIs, I am able to satisfy my sometimes ADD personality with a diverse range of subject areas ranging from social to the internet of things.  And by telling stories of the best practices in APIs, I&rsquo;m able to help provide much needed information to people planning, deploying and managing APIs in critical sectors like government, education and healthcare.</p>
<p>In 2010 when I began, it was clear to me that the technology of APIs was here to say, but there was a lot to learn when it came to the business of APIs, and evangelizing the value of APIs beyond developer community and Silicon Valley.  Two and half years later I feel that the business of APIs is progressing and much of the success I&rsquo;ve highlighted in the space is catching on with mainstream companies, with many business sectors are waking up to the potential.</p>
<p>In 2012 I felt an awakening.  An awakening that APIs exist, and the potential they possess in industries from telecommunications to government.  This wasn&rsquo;t just in the U.S.  I talked with people from France to Brazil about the importance of APIs.  Sitting here on January 1st, 2013, I feel we are on the verge of a pivotal year in APIs.</p>
<p>While APIs time has definitely come, there are many paths we can take from here when it comes to terms of use, business models or decisions around hypermedia that could benefit or severely damage the potential APIs can deliver.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/api-evangelist-2013.png" alt="" width="500" /></p>
<p>To quote a friend of mine, APIs are very tactical. &nbsp;And because of this, I don&rsquo;t think we can make predictions. &nbsp;As API owners you can just focus on what you do best, solve your problems in real-time--while also making sure to look up from time to time and get your bearings in respect to the rest of the space and your industry.</p>
<p>I also hope as an API Evangelist I can maintain an awareness of the overall space, and provide news and analysis here at API Evangelist that will help you in your efforts. &nbsp;If you feel your story might help someone else in the space, make sure and reach out to me so I can help you get it out.</p>
<p>Happy New Year! &nbsp;Hang on, it is going to be an exciting year for APIs.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/12/30/history-of-apis-programmableweb/">History of APIs:  ProgrammableWeb</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">30 Dec 2012</span>
        <p>While writing about the&nbsp;<a title="history of APIs" href="/history/">history of APIs</a>, it is easy to be so focused on just APIs, that you overlook the single most important player in the entire history of the web API--<a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a>.</p>
<p>In July 2005, John Musser started ProgrammableWeb. According to his original about page:</p>
<p><a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://programmableweb.com"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/programmableweb/ProgrammableWeb-10-2005.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<blockquote><em>ProgrammableWeb is a web-as-platform reference site and blog delivering news, information and resources for developing applications using the Web 2.0 APIs.</em></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>I started this site because I couldn't find what I was looking for: a technology focused&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2005/08/20/so-many-apis-so-little-time/">starting point for web platform development</a>. (For a bit more see my initial post.) Although no guarantees, the last time I started a reference site it somehow became Google's highest rated link on the topic. Given that this site will be a collaborative effort with community input as well, this can be what we make it.</em></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>I hope you find the site useful.</em></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>John Musser - Seattle, August 2005</em></blockquote>
<p>I think John&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2005/08/20/so-many-apis-so-little-time/">original blog post</a>&nbsp;on why he started ProgrammableWeb, says it all:<strong><em>&nbsp;Why? Because going From Web Page to Web Platform is a big deal</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Web APIs are a big deal! Whether its social networking, government, healthcare or education--having a programmable platform to make data and resources available will be a critical part of how commerce and society operates from here on forward. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>John made a early decision to showcase open and RESTful approaches to deploying APIs vs. parallel attempts of&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture">Service Oriented Architecture</a>(SOA) and&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service">Web Services</a>, and focused on telling stories about open APIs--way before it was the thing to do in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>When I started API Evangelist in July 2010 (5 years after PW), and started talking about the business of APIs, the technology of web APIs was already widely accepted in Silicon Valley, because of the stories John Musser and Adam Duvander have told on ProgrammableWeb.</p>
<p><a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://programmableweb.com"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/programmableweb/programmableweb-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>As we close 2012, a year in which I think we can confidently say APIs are moving mainstream, and I feel we owe much of the success to ProgrammableWeb. The stories John, Adam and other writers have been telling on ProgrammableWeb have been crucial to quantifying and defining the API industry--allowing us all to build, iterate and move things forward. Without stories around the technical, business and politics of APIs, these virtual interfaces would not have been able to find a place in our real life worlds.</p>
<p>Thanks John, Adam and ProgrammableWeb, for telling the stories that got us here.</p>

<p>You can learn a lot from the <a href="/history/">history of APIs</a>, and following what the pioneers are doing. &nbsp;Salesforce isn't the coolest API within the Hacker News community, but when it comes to building an API ecosystem--Salesforce knows what they are doing.</p>
<p>I was reading through the <a href="http://blogs.developerforce.com/developer-relations/2012/12/yearinreview.html">Salesforce top developers highlights of 2012</a>. &nbsp;Their highlights doesn't just showcase the success of the community, but what Salesforce feels is critical to keeping their ecosystem healthy.&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>800,000 developers and climbing:</strong>&nbsp;the Salesforce Platform Developer Community is growing at an unprecedented rate.</li>
<li><strong>Cool new Salesforce technologies:</strong>&nbsp;<a href="http://wiki.developerforce.com/page/Identity">Identity</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://wiki.developerforce.com/page/Salesforce_touch_platform">Salesforce Touch Platform</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://wiki.developerforce.com/page/Force.com_Canvas">Force.com Canvas</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.heroku.com/archives/2012/9/19/announcing_heroku_enterprise_for_java/">Java on Heroku&nbsp;</a>for the Enterprise were released.</li>
<li><strong>Content is king:</strong>&nbsp;Great books such as&nbsp;<a href="http://media.developerforce.com/pdfs/salesforce_touch_platform.pdf">The Salesforce Touch Platform Mobile Development Guide</a>&nbsp;and Dan Appleman&rsquo;s new book&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Apex-Programming-Salesforce-com-Force-com/dp/1936754053">Advanced Apex Programming for Salesforce.com&nbsp;</a>hit the shelves.</li>
<li><strong>Community is making noise:</strong>&nbsp;<a href="http://salesforce.stackexchange.com/">Salesforce Stack Exchange</a>&nbsp;launched and is already at&nbsp;<a href="http://blogs.developerforce.com/developer-relations/2012/12/salesforce-stack-exchange-qa-site-reaches-1000-users.html">1,000 users</a>.&nbsp;<a href="http://wiki.developerforce.com/page/Force.com_User_Groups">Developer User Groups</a>&nbsp;have grown to 60 groups across the globe and climbing.</li>

<li><strong>We are staying connected, more often and in more ways:</strong>&nbsp;<a href="http://developer.force.com/content/type/Webinar" target="_blank">Webinars</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://developer.force.com/codetalk" target="_blank">CodeTalks</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgIMQe2PKPSJ8bIOnDSXihHEnEcgIiOfv&amp;feature=view_all" target="_blank">Google+ Hangouts</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/forcedotcom" target="_blank">Facebook</a>,<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/forcedotcom" target="_blank">Twitter</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://boards.developerforce.com/sforce/?category.id=developers" target="_blank">Discussion Boards</a>, and the list goes on.</li>
<li><strong>Developer Events of Epic Proportions:</strong>&nbsp;10,000 Developers at Dreamforce &lsquo;12 with close to&nbsp;<a href="http://events.developerforce.com/conference/dreamforce">300 sessions</a>, Developer Zones at Cloudforce in New York, Tokyo, and London, and Developer Weeks in Brazil and India.</li>
</ul>
<p>What I hear when I read this list is that to get to 800K developers (holy shit), you need to constantly release new technologies, product resources and content to support your platform, give your community a voice with an emphasis on showcasing the leaders--while also engaging with developers both online and offline.</p>

<p>Salesforce has been building their API ecosystem for 12 years! &nbsp;Twice as long as Twitter. &nbsp;What they highlight as part of their developer community in 2012 is something you should be doing in your own developer community.</p>

<p>Storytelling in the API industry is critical to the healthy growth of the space.  John Musser and <a title="ProgrammableWeb" href="http://programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a> have been telling great stories in the tech industry, since way before APIs were all lthe rage they are now.</p>
<p>While I was at <a title="API Days" href="http://apidays.io">API Days</a> this year,  I was speaking with Mike Amundsen (<a href="https://twitter.com/mamund">@mamund</a>) of <a href="http://www.layer7tech.com/">Layer7</a>, and we started talking about how Amazon, Netflix (and I&rsquo;d add Twilio) tend to dominate the API discussion.  I considered my talks from API Days, and sure enough--Netflix and Amazon were in there multiple times!</p>
<p>There are other stories we tell around Twitter, Facebook Google and other smaller APIs, but Amazon, Netflix and Twilio were cornerstones of API folklore in 2012.  While I will keep telling these pillar stories (because they matter), as well as evolving other pioneers from my <a title="history of APIs" href="/history/">history of APIs</a> section, I want to develop a fresh lineup of amazing API stories for 2013.</p>
<p>Stories like <a title="ohnson Control's, Panoptix API" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/12/17/make-an-impact-on-our-environment-using-apis/">Johnson Control's, Panoptix API</a>, and how a 125 year old company can change their culture and embrace a new way of doing business via APIs.</p>
<p>I will make sure there is easy access to the classic Amazon, Netflix and Twilio API stories.  I will also be adding new versions of some other classic stories from Salesforce, eBay, Flickr and other API pioneers.  But in 2013 I will be working to find a new set of API stories from brands and companies we know.</p>
<p>If you have an API success story you&rsquo;d like to share, please let me know.</p>

        <span class="post-date">27 Dec 2012</span>
        <p><a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_ITTC_PersonalDataNewAsset_Report_2011.pdf" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/world-economic-forum/world-economic-forum-personal-data-cover.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm immersed in deep thought around my personal data, asking some important <a href="http://personaldata.apievangelist.com/">questions about my digital self</a>--which includes the state of my online personal data.</p>
<p>After reading <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2012/12/14-trends-for-2013.html">14 big trends to watch in 2013</a>, by Alex Howard (<a href="https://twitter.com/digiphile">@digiphile</a>), I got immersed in <a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_ITTC_PersonalDataNewAsset_Report_2011.pdf">World Economic Forums Personal Data: The Emergence of a New Asset Class</a> paper.</p>
<p>I'm still processing all of my thoughts around the paper, but one statement really stands out:</p>
<blockquote><em>The issues surrounding personal data &ndash; political, technological and commercial alike &ndash; are numerous and complex. The choices stakeholders make today will influence the personal data ecosystem for years to come.</em></blockquote>
<p>The World Economic Forum then outlines five key area that require action:</p>
<ol class="mainlist">
<li>Innovate around user-centricity and trust. The personal data ecosystem will be built on the trust and control individuals have in sharing their data. From a technological, policy and sociological sense all stakeholders need to embrace this construct. One particular area of focus is the continued testing and promoting of &ldquo;trust frameworks&rdquo; that explore innovative approaches for identity assurance at Internet scale</li>
<li>Define global principles for using and sharing personal data. Given the lack of globally accepted policies governing the use and exchange of personal data, an international community of stakeholders should articulate and advance core principles of a user-centric personal data ecosystem. These pilots should invite real-world input from a diverse group of individuals who can not only articulate the values, needs and desires of end users, but also the complex and contextual nuances involved in revealing one&rsquo;s digital identity</li>
<li>Strengthen the dialog between regulators and the private sector. Building on a collective sense of fundamental principles for creating a balanced ecosystem, public and private stakeholders should actively collaborate as the ecosystem begins to take shape. Those responsible for building and deploying the tools (the technologists) should more closely align with those making the rules (regulators)</li>
<li>Focus on interoperability and open standards. With the appropriate user controls and legal infrastructure in place, innovations in how personal data moves throughout the value chain will be a key driver for societal and economic value creation. Enabling a secure, trusted, reliable and open infrastructure (both legal and technical) will be vital. Participants should identify best practices and engage with standards bodies, advocacy groups, think tanks and various consortia on the user-centric approaches required to scale the value of personal data</li>
<li>Continually share knowledge. It&rsquo;s a huge challenge for entities to keep up with new research, policies and commercial developments. To stay current, stakeholders should share insights and learnings on their relevant activities, from both successes as well as failures. After all, the ecosystem&rsquo;s promise is about the tremendous value created when individuals share information about who they are and what they know. Clearly, this principle should also apply to practitioners within the development community</li>
</ol>
<p>Whether its social networks or education and healthcare, personal data will be a major driver of API adoption in 2013.  Personal data is at the heart of the recent social and mobile movements, and there are very serious illnesses in how we buy and sell personal data in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>I agree with Alex Howard, that personal data ownership will be big issue in 2013, and intrigued by the World Economic Forums insight on personal data, it asks a lot of great questions--questions that we need bring mainstream in 2013.</p>

<p>While traveling the globe, dedicating my life to API evangelism, I only drink one beer--IPAs.</p>
<p>Coincidence?  I think not!</p>
<p>This blog is dedicated to discussing the amazing world of India Pale Ales, also known as IPAs.</p>
<p>Once you have acquired the taste for the hoppiness of IPAs, you'll never go back.</p>

<p>The end of the year is a great time to reflect--looking back at the year with a desire to quantify and understand ourselves.</p>
<p>With our increasingly digital (social, cloud, mobile, APIs) lives, there are more opportunities than ever to ask our digital self very specific questions, and with the power the API get an answer back.</p>
<p>Over the holidayz, I spent some time asking some questions I wanted to know about my world in 2012--things that were important to me, and help me feel healthy, happy, accomplished and ultimately successful. (aka.&nbsp;<a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/10/18/optimize-for-happiness.html" target="_blank">Optimize for Happiness</a>)</p>
<p>I broke these questions up into interest areas, then using APIs set out to find the services I use, or could use, that would help me answer these questions.</p>

<p>This is all a work in progress. &nbsp;I wanted a list that could evolve, but I could use as a framework for actually answering some of these questions--either annually or real-time if possible, using APIs.</p>
<p>To facilitate this process, I've <a title="Personal Data Questions" href="http://personaldata.apievangelist.com/" target="_blank">published as project on Github</a>. &nbsp;I will be publishing all the questions I ask, and their solutions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>So far, I've been able to use <a href="http://singly.com">Singly</a> and answer a number of critical questions about 2012 using Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram and Google--via the <a href="http://singly.com">Singly API</a>.</p>
<p>If you have questions you'd like asked, you can visit my <a href="http://personaldata.apievangelist.com/">personal data questions project</a> and comment via Disqus or if you want, you can <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/personal-data-questions">fork and contribute</a> your own questions and API driven solutions.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/12/22/amazing-visuals-but-lack-of-api-imagination/">Amazing Visuals, But Lack of API Imagination</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">22 Dec 2012</span>
        <p><a href="http://kinlane.github.com/earth-as-art/index.html" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/earth-as-art/desolation-canyon.jpeg" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I was scrolling through my feeds today and I came across, "<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/connect/ebooks/earth_art_detail.html">Earth As Art</a>" from NASA.  I clicked on the homepage and didn&rsquo;t think much, and moved on.  Then I came across <a href="http://flowingdata.com/2012/12/21/earth-as-art-from-nasa/">Earth as Art book from NASA on Flowing Data</a>, where they showed an actual image from the &ldquo;Earth As Art&rdquo; collection.</p>
<p>Sure, I suffer from ADD.  But so does much of the world.  I work through huge amounts of data on a daily basis, looking for gems.  Sometimes I can find them myself, and sometimes I need help.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Earth as Art&rdquo; is an amazing collection of satellite photos from NASA.   I feel the entire collection could be made into an exhibit, allowing us to experience, take in and discuss the meaning of art, created from space of the planet we live on.</p>
<p>I also feel NASA&rsquo;s Earth as Art I think is a poster boy example of how APIs can open up and provide access to content, but also work as conduit for syndication, sharing, remixing and expression around content the owner may not have been able to see.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/connect/ebooks/earth_art_detail.html">deployment of the Earth as Art collection at NASA</a> has a title, description and meaningless photo thumbnail--accompanied by a <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/703154main_earth_art-ebook.pdf">PDF</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nasa-earth-as-art/id577527077?mt=8">iPad app</a>.  Obviously NASA saw the value in delivering an iPad app, and making the content accessible to the masses via a PDF.</p>
<p>As soon as I saw the images I want to create something that would share, syndicate and bring awareness to their beauty.  My hands are immediately tied, with only a PDF and iPad app--I am not equipped with the tools of a developer.</p>
<p>If there were simply a JSON file of all images, titles, locations and details. Before I got to work, I looked around, but couldn&rsquo;t find any raw data for the project.  So I created <a href="https://raw.github.com/kinlane/earth-as-art/gh-pages/data/photos.json">my own JSON representation</a> of the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/703154main_earth_art-ebook.pdf">Earth as Art PDF</a>.</p>
<p>JSON output is so much more valuable than PDF output.  It took me about 2 hours to reverse engineer the Earth as Art PDF and render as images and text.  Now, equipped with the parts and pieces of the Earth as Art content, with JSON file as a framework--I can get to work creating several, more interactive representations of the satellite imagery.</p>
<p>Before I create any visualizations, I need a place to put my project.  No better place than <a href="/admin/blog/http:/github.com">Github</a>.  I can use <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> to host my project and with a JSON file as my data source, I can easily use <a href="http://mustache.github.com/">Mustache Templates</a> to display the images and allow for basic browsing.</p>
<p>Instead of a single, static PDF--I now have all my images and the title, details, location and paths in a JSON file I can render the content in any way I want:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>HTML Templates</strong> - Using JSON + Mustache I can view images on a listing with detail pages</li>
<li><strong>Deck.js Presentation </strong>- Create a presentation in markdown using the satellite imagery and content, laid out using the deck.js framework</li>
<li><strong>Widgets</strong> - Develop several, embeddable, syndicatable JavaScript widgets that are driven from the JSON file</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://kinlane.github.com/earth-as-art/index.html" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/earth-as-art/great-salt-desert.jpeg" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Having the Earth as a Art assets stored as individual images with name, details, location and image paths as JSON allows me build my own HTML display, presentations and widgets around the content.</p>
<p><a href="http://kinlane.github.com/earth-as-art/index.html" target="_blank">Hosting the Earth as Art project at Github</a> allows me to provide simple, inexpensive, open hosting for the data, content and display elements--allowing <span style="text-decoration: underline;">anyone</span> to fork, download and remix and even choose to contribute back.</p>
<p>As another project, I can explore the licensing, branding and other aspects that will ensure the creators of the content (NASA), get the attribution they deserve for creating such amazing content.</p>
<p>When I first saw the Earth as Art pictures this morning, I couldn&rsquo;t get over the fact that they weren&rsquo;t in a format that allowed for remix, sharing and syndication.  The images are amazing and really lend themselves for infinite presentations and interpretations.</p>
<p>Hopefully the project will only grow from here.</p>

<p>These areas reflect the patterns I'm seeing, and while some API owners or API service providers may fall into one or many of these areas, I've broken them down into, what I feel are meaningful groups that will help me explain the future of APIs to the masses. &nbsp;With a goal of demonstrating the value, power and importance of APIs.</p>
<p>If you feel there are other trends I'm missing, patterns I'm not seeing or companies that are doing cool stuff in these areas, please let me know. &nbsp;As with all of API Evangelist, these new sections are a work in progress--help it grow.</p>

<p>The history of APIs is something I discuss a lot. &nbsp;The history of modern web APIs is something I include in all my talks, and I'm always surprised by how little people understand some of the more popular APIs that got us to where we are at.</p>
<p>To further support this area, I've launched a <a title="History of APIs" href="http://apievangelist.com/history/">History of APIs</a> section where I've hung the stories I've already done in this area, and will be looking to dig up the history on other APIs that are shaking things up.</p>
<p>When I'm talking to people about APIs, the term APIs can mean many different things. Sometimes it means hardware APIs, or the Java API or various other technical incarnations. Right now when you hear the term API, it probably means web API or an API built using REST, running on the same infrastructure the World Wide Web runs on.</p>
<p>When it comes to APIs, I strongly feel that to understand where we are, we need to understand the short, modern history of the web APIs. There are several patterns to why the modern web API movement has worked, that I think you can take home and use in your own API strategy.</p>
<h2>Commerce</h2>
<p>While modern web APIs were officially born with&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm" target="_blank">Roy Fieldings dissertation Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures in 2000</a>--Web APIs first appeared in the wild with the&nbsp;<a title="Saleforce" href="/history/salesforce.php">introduction of Salesforce</a>&nbsp;on February 7th, when the company officially launched its API at the IDG Demo 2000 conference. Salesforce was an enterprise-class, web-based, sales force automation as a "Internet as a service", with XML APIs were part of Salesforce.com from day one.</p>

<p>Later in the year, on November 20, 2000,&nbsp;<a title="eBay" href="/history/ebay.php">eBay launched the eBay Application Program Interface (API)</a>, along with the eBay Developers Program--which was originally rolled out to only a select number of licensed eBay partners and developers.</p>

<p>Then on July 16, 2002,&nbsp;<a title="Amazon E-Commerce" href="/history/amazon.php">Amazon launched Amazon.com Web Services</a>&nbsp;allowing developers to incorporate Amazon.com content and features into their own web sites. Amazon.com Web Services (AWS) allowed third party sites to search and display products from Amazon.com in an XML format.</p>

<p>The modern Web API movement was kicked off. But for some reason it didn't gain the momentum we see today, whether it was due to the "dotcom" bubble bursting or other things werent quite ready--web APIs wouldn't get traction until things got social.</p>
<h2>Social</h2>
<p>In February 2004 the popular photo sharing site Flickr launched. Six months later&nbsp;<a title="Flickr" href="/history/flickr.php">they launched their now infamous API</a>, and six months after that, they were acquired by Yahoo. The launch of the RESTful API helped Flickr quickly become the image platform of choice for the early blogging and social media movement by allowing users to easily embed their Flickr photos into their blogs and social network streams. While allowing Flickr to focus on a&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/07/biz-dev-2-0/" target="_blank">new approach to business development using web APIs</a>.</p>

<p>Then on August 15th 2006,&nbsp;<a title="Facebook" href="/history/facebook.php">Facebook launched its long-awaited development platform and API</a>.

<p>One month later on September 20, 2006&nbsp;<a title="Twitter" href="/history/twitter.php">Twitter introduced the Twitter API to the world</a>. Much like the release of the eBay API, Twitter's API release was in response to the growing usage of Twitter by those scraping the site or creating rogue APIs.</p>

<p>At the same time Facebook and Twitter were playing with the social powers of web APIs, Google was exploring the power of web APIs supporting embeddable tools and apps. The&nbsp;<a title="Google Maps" href="/history/google-maps.php">Google Maps API launched was just shy of 6 months after the release of Google Maps as an application</a>, and was in direct response to the number of rogue applications developed that were hacking the application. Google Maps was immediately so popular that developers hacked the JavaScript interface and developed application such as housingmaps.com and chicagocime.org.</p>

<p>At this point web APIs were showing the power of the Internet when it came to sharing, making things embeddable and social. Web APIs still were perceived as "hobby" by mainstream business. You couldn't take care of business...yet.</p>
<h2>Cloud Computing</h2>
<p>As APIs were generating social buzz across the Internet, Amazon saw the potential of an&nbsp;<a title="RESTful approach to business" href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/04/09/restful-business-architecture/" target="_blank">RESTful approach to business</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/" target="_blank">internalized and saw APIs in a way that nobody had seen them before</a>--giving re-birth to an Amazon Web Services that was much, much more than just e-commerce.</p>
<p>In March, 2006 Amazon launched a new web service, something completely different from the Amazon bookseller and e-commerce site we've come to know. This was a new endeavor for Amazon: a storage web service called&nbsp;<a title="Amazon S3" href="/history/amazon-s3.php">Amazon S3</a>. Amazon S3 which provided a simple interface that can be used to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web. It gives developers access to the same highly scalable, reliable, fast, inexpensive data storage infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own global network of websites.</p>
<p><a title="Amazon S3" href="/history/amazon-s3.php"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/AWS_LOGO_CMYK.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="center" /></a></p>
<p>Six month later, shortly after launching Amazon S3, Amazon followed with a new cloud computing service dubbed&nbsp;<a title="Amazon EC2" href="/history/amazon-ec2.php">Amazon EC2</a>&nbsp;or Elastic Compute Cloud. Amazon EC2 provided resizable compute capacity in the cloud, allowing developers to launch different sizes of virtual servers within Amazon data centers. Just like its predecessor Amazon S3, Amazon EC2 was just a RESTful API. Amazon wouldn't launch a web interface for another three years.</p>
<p>With cloud computing, web APIs got real. You could now deploy global infrastructure using APIs. It wasn't just about social fun anymore, you could actually run your business using APIs.</p>
<p>Even with this new found power of API driven cloud computing, it would take one more essential ingredient before web APIs were ready for the prime time.</p>
<h2>Mobile</h2>
<p>With everyone focused on social and the cloud, a new device emerged, and much like social and cloud, would prove to be a game changer. In June of 2009 Apple launched the iPhone 3G, the App Store began allowing iPod Touch and iPhone owners to download applications through the iTunes desktop software or the App Store on their iPhones--opening up entirely new world of mobile applications, one that APIs would be the driving force.</p>
<p>Soon after the launch of the iPhone, in March 2009&nbsp;<a title="Foursquare" href="/history/foursquare.php">Foursquare launched</a>&nbsp;at the SXSW interactive festival in Austin, TX. Foursquare was a location-based mobile platform that makes cities more interesting to explore, by checking in via a smartphone app or SMS, users share their location with friends while collecting points and virtual badges. This new type of mobile app, utilized APIs to allow developers to deliver a new generation of location aware, API driven applications, feeding the growing app economy.</p>

<p>The mobile evolution of the Internet was under way, and the following year on October 6, 2010,<a title="Instagram" href="/history/instagram.php">Instagram launched its photo-sharing iPhone application</a>. Less than three months later, it had one million users. Kevin Systrom the founder of Instagram focused on delivering a powerful, but simple iPhone app that solved common problems with the quality of mobile photos and users' frustrations with sharing.</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>Immediately many users complained about the lack of central Instagram web site or an API, with Instragram remaining firm on focusing its energy on the core iPhone application. In December a developer name Mislav Marohni? took it upon himself to reverse engineer how the iPhone app worked, and&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2010/12/15/the-full-featured-unpublished-instagram-api/" target="_blank">built his own unofficial Instagram API</a>&nbsp;on top of private Instagram APIs. By&nbsp;<a href="/2011/02/08/instagram-launches-api/" target="_blank">January Instagram shut down the rogue API, announcing that it was building one of its own</a>.</p>
<p>The appetite for API resources to drive mobile has only grown with the introduction of the iPad tablet and the growth of the Android and Windows mobile platforms.</p>
<p>Mobile was the finalize piece of the digital strategy puzzle, which included commerce, social and cloud--all required before the original vision of web APIs could be realized.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Web APIs got their start in early e-commerce on the Internet, but without social, a scalable cloud backend and a ubiquitous mobile devices--APIs weren't ready for prime time. In 2012, we reached that point.</p>
<p>Every company needs a healthy digital strategy for success in 2013, which includes sensible uses of social, cloud, mobile--all depending upon APIs. While there are plenty of other APIs to learn from, we can learn a lot from the history of modern web APIs, and these early web API pioneers.</p>

        <span class="post-date">19 Dec 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/scripting-platforms.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working hard to understand the emerging patterns of of how APIs used, work through the details, and grasp the differences in competing approaches--in hopes of identifying <a title="what is next when it comes to web APIs" href="/2012/07/27/what-is-the-future-of-web-apis/">what is next when it comes to web APIs</a>.</p>
<p>One trend I&rsquo;m tracking on is the emergence of API scripting platforms.  This is a difficult are to track on, because we script against APIs all the time, right? This is different.  Scripting platforms are providing platforms and libraries to support easily scripting against multiple APIs.</p>
<p>To help me understand this new approach to using APIs I&rsquo;m studying three separate approaches:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="Webshell" href="http://webshell.io/">Webshell</a></strong> - Authentication, integration and scripting platform.</li>
<li><strong><a title="Temboo" href="https://www.temboo.com/">Temboo</a></strong> - Beyond&nbsp;code snippets, into ready-to-use processes, that simply API integration, taking care of authentication, credential management, updates and more</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developers.google.com/apps-script/">Google Apps Scripts</a></strong> -&nbsp;<span>A JavaScript cloud scripting language that lets you extend Google Apps, integrate 3rd party services and build mobile and web applications.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>All three of these platforms are bringing together valuable API resources, from multiple sources into not just a common interface, but providing a language library you can use to build apps efficiently across multiple API resources.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still working to understand the nuances of each approach. For example, Google provides its JavaScript like, stripped down language, where Webshell focuses on JavaScript and CoffeeScript.  Temboo provides ready to go processes or what they call choreos, with language SDKs in Java, Node.js, PHP, Ruby and Python.</p>
<p>Google Apps Script provides access to Google APIs and services, but recently opened up scripts to acts as connectors, that can be developed by 3rd party providers.  Temboo has over 100 APIs in its library, while Webshell is just getting going with less than 25.</p>
<p>I see what Webshell, Temboo and Google are doing as similar to the aggregation, integration and some times automation we are seeing in other trending API areas, but these approaches are actually building languages that allow you to be more expressive with not just single APIs, but fluently with many APIs at once.</p>
<p>This area is new and emerging, and I&rsquo;m still working to understand the different approaches.  let me know if you if you have anything I should be looking at or other thoughts. &nbsp;</p>
<p>More to come...</p>

<p>I'm working on a new trends section of API Evangelist. &nbsp;One area i'm tracking on is the opportunities around 3D printing and APIs. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I did some fun research, and <a href="/2011/05/18/3d-printing-and-manufacturing-supply-chain/">laid down some interest thoughts on APIs and 3D printing in 2011</a>. &nbsp;This was part of some research I was doing while working at Mimeo. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As I do with all my research, I blog along the way, to help me learn and organize my thoughts. With this trends research into 3D printing, I am working to understand the major components of 3D printing so I can see where APIs are can have the biggest impact.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I've identified 10 major components of 3D printing:</span></p>

<p>The <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2012/05/22/6000-apis-its-business-its-social-and-its-happening-quickly/">number of available APIs is growing at a neck breaking speed</a>.  I have trouble keeping up with individual APIs, and I feel I am losing touch with the nuances and trends within specific areas like music or travel.</p>
<p>I am getting more and more questions like this via email and twitter:</p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>I am doing some research on music APIs. I am considering using one to integrate music streaming and relevant data into an app.  Can you recommend anyone who has technical or business expertise (or both) with these in particular?  I would love to speak with an expert to help lead me and my developers in the right direction.  Some points I am considering:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Technical capabilities (streaming speed, limitations of service, etc.)</li>
<li>Access to support from API parent company</li>
<li>Business opportunities or restrictions that arise when relying on the API</li>
</ul>
</em></blockquote>
<p>These are concerns that might be shared with other industries, but knowing the music industry--there are plenty of unique issues developers encounter when building applications and businesses around music APIs.</p>
<p>Back in February, I did write on how <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2012/02/15/emi-helps-developers-navigate-building-apps-for-music-industry/">EMI is helping developers navigate building apps for the music industry</a>, but beyond just shedding light on what others are doing, I don&rsquo;t have the time to specialize in the details of how APIs are transforming the music industry.</p>
<p>There is a huge need for more professionals to step up within specific industries and develop the domain expertise necessary to make sure APIs are being deployed with the proper technical, business and political building blocks, and help developers understand how to navigate the nuances of a particular industry being transformed by web APIs.</p>
<p>Could you be this person, feel free to connect with me. &nbsp;I see a desperate need for experts in the music industry, education, health care, government and other fast moving business sectors.</p>

<p>To grow Panoptix, Johnson Controls introduced a <a title="marketplace" href="http://whatspossible.johnsoncontrols.com/community/panoptix/apps">marketplace of apps</a> combined with supporting news, information, resources and entire community dedicated to building performance and efficiency management.</p>
<p>This marketplace and community is driven by an&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.panoptix.com/">API developer area</a>, allowing anyone to <a href="https://developer.panoptix.com/signup/">sign up</a> and get to work developing apps and start selling them in the Panoptix marketplace.  The Panoptix API is free to use for anyone looking to developer one app, allowing you to collect 70% of revenue from app sales in the marketplace (an essential ingredient for developer success).</p>
<p>I like Johnson Controls approach to building a community around building management applications, data and resources--complete with a API driven developer area.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s great to see a 125 year old company open up their hardware and software with such an innovative approach.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be digging further into how <a href="http://www.johnsoncontrols.com/content/us/en.html">Johnsons Controls</a> deployed the Panoptix API, with further entries to this blog series, and a full case study on their approach to delivering their API driven building management platform.</p>
