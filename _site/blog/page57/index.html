<p>I call it being an evangelist, but it has other names, such as advocate or ambassador.  Someone who is good at evangelism, in my opinion, starts with a love of hacking but is also having a love of helping others learn and understand technology.  I can&rsquo;t help being an evangelist, it&rsquo;s just part of my personality.</p>
<p>These days, I get enough requests for evangelists, so I decided to start finding passionate hackers within specific communities to help fill requests.  Some requests for evangelists are full time positions, some part time, while others involve just going to meetups and hackathons in evenings and on weekends as needed.</p>
<p>Currently I&rsquo;m on the hunt for some passionate hacker personalities in New York, Chicago, Boston, Seattle, Denver, Austin, Atlanta and Portland.  If you live in these cities, are passionate about API, mobile, social and the cloud--you should consider a life of evangelism.</p>
<p>Even if you aren&rsquo;t quite sure what an evangelist, advocate or ambassador does, feel free to reach out.  Chances are you are already attending meetups, hackathons and already doing evangelism activities--you just aren&rsquo;t getting paid or receiving incentives to do so.</p>
<p>Visit the <a title="interested in evangelism" href="/interested_in_evangelism.php">interested in evangelism page</a> and I can answer your questions and get you plugged in. &nbsp;</p>

<p>One very powerful way to use <a title="Github" href="https://github.com/">Github</a> within your API strategy is for developer profiling.  This approach requires the deployment of another Github solution, API <a title="Developer login using Github" href="/2012/10/29/api-developer-login-using-github/">Developer login using Github</a>.</p>
<p>After you implement authentication for you API using Github, the <a href="https://www.singly.com/docs/github">Github API</a> provides a wealth of opportunity for you to learn more about developers.</p>
<p>The types of developers you want for your API are also developers who have an active Github profiles.  Using Github, you can immediately tell if someone is an active developer based upon their presence and usage of the social coding network.</p>
<p>Github provides basic profile details, like where a developer lives and which programming language they use.  You can also see which other tools and code they following and commit to, giving an overall profile of their developer lifestyle.</p>
<p>Using Github you will also be able to tell if a user has downloaded or forked your own API SDK's, giving you insight into how well your SDK"s are being received and used.   There are endless ways you can use Github to stay in tune with your developers, but first you have to employ <a title="Github authentication as part of your API strategy" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/09/05/provide-api-developers-with-github-login-using-singly/">Github authentication as part of your API strategy</a>--then get to work profiling developers, and better understand who they are.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Nov 2012</span>
        <p>I spend a lot of time trying to find company logos and a little blurb about what a company does. &nbsp;You'd think in this cloudy API driven world there would a simpler way. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I decided to create my own solution. &nbsp;I created an <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/about.json" target="_blank">about.json file for API Evangelist</a>.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/4003224.js?file=about.json"></script>
<p>When you need my company logo, a quick description about API Evangelist or other key information like my Twitter account or Blog RSS, you know where to find it.</p>
<p>Now, could you please create one for your company? &nbsp;You can copy my about.json above, go to <a href="http://jsoneditoronline.org/">JSON Editor Online</a>, paste it in and create your own. &nbsp;When done, make sure and save to your desktop as text file and upload to the root of your site. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll always take a look at http://example.com/about.json first to see if a company has it, before Googling on my own for a logo and about blurb.</p>
<p>Maybe some day, every site will have one.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/11/02/help-eff-make-case-for-no-copryight-on-apis/">Help EFF Make Case For No Copryight on APIs</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">02 Nov 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/electronic-frontier-foundation/electronic-frontier-foundation-logo.gif" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/11/no-copyrights-apis-help-us-make-case">Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) needs our help</a> to explain to the Federal Circuit Court on why there should <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span></strong> be copyrights on APIs.  As EFF published today:</p>
<blockquote><em>Earlier this year, we applauded District Court Judge Alsup for getting it right and holding that, as a matter of law, one could not copyright APIs. The case, Oracle v. Google, is now on appeal to the Federal Circuit, where a three-judge panel is going to revisit Judge Alsup&rsquo;s ruling.</em></blockquote>
<p>The EFF is soliciting the our assistance in how to help build the case, asking for feedback on two example areas:</p>
<ol class="mainlist">
<li>Software reimplementing someone else&rsquo;s API, calling someone else&rsquo;s API, or any other uses of third-party APIs for interoperability, competition, or innovation.</li>
<li>Reimplementation of an API, where the resulting software benefitted the original API creator, perhaps by increasing the creator&rsquo;s user base or otherwise benefitted the developer community</li>
</ol>
<p>I think we are in the infancy of API deployment, so it&rsquo;s going to be tough to find many solid examples. &nbsp;But I think the two areas we can demonstrate the importance of no copyright on APIs, is within two business sectors that evolved on the web, using APIs and are critical to business and government today:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Cloud</strong> - As EFF said, Eucalyptus reimplemented the Amazon API to offer a competing cloud storage service.  You also saw the same with <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/2010/09/01/google-storage-for-developers-interoperability/">first implementation of Google Developer Storage</a> and up to &amp; other providers: <a href="http://trac.cyberduck.ch/wiki/help/en/howto/dunkel">Dunkel Cloud Storage</a>, <a href="http://www.hosteurope.de/produkte/Cloud-Storage">âHost Europe Cloud Storage</a>, <a href="http://trac.cyberduck.ch/wiki/help/en/howto/greenqloud">GreenQloud Storage Qloud</a>, <a href="http://www.scaleupcloud.com/">ScaleUp Technologies</a>, <a href="https://www.mh.connectria.com/rp/order/cloud_storage_index">âConnectria Cloud Storage</a>, <a href="http://trac.cyberduck.ch/wiki/help/en/howto/lunacloud">Lunacloud</a>, and <a href="http://trac.cyberduck.ch/wiki/help/en/howto/dreamobjects">DreamObjects Cloud Storage</a>&nbsp;providing unprecedented interoperability for cloud computing.</li>
<li><strong>Social</strong> - Same as with cloud you have seen competition pop up for both Twitter and Facebook, mimicking their platform and APIs.  Platforms like <a title="App.net" href="https://join.app.net/">App.net</a> have copied Twitter&rsquo;s social network providing competition, and potential value to Twitter users by allowing developers to use App.net for things they can't use Twitter for.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think another clear example of open API design being used to help users is Pinboard&rsquo;s implementation of the Delicious API:</p>
<ol class="mainlist"> 
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="85" align="center" valign="top"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/pinboard/pinboard-icon.png" alt="" width="75" /></td>
<td><strong><a title="Pinboard" href="http://pinboard.in/api/">Pinboard</a></strong> - Wherever possible the Pinboard API uses the same syntax and method names as the Delicious V1 API. This implementation allowed users to seamlessly export Delicious bookmarks accumulated over several years to Pinboard when Delicious was sold by Yahoo. &nbsp;If Yahoo had copyrighted their API design, Pinboard could never have done this.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</ol>
<p>A slightly different approach to offering benefit to users via an open API design is surrounding the Instagram API:</p>
<ol class="mainlist"> 
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="85" align="center" valign="top"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/instagram/instagram-icon-250.png" alt="" width="75" /></td>
<td><strong><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/02/08/instagram-launches-api/">Instagram API </a></strong>- In 2010, before Instagram itself launched an API, a passionate developer launched a rogue API for the popular photo sharing platform based upon Instagram's own internal API design they used to drive the popular iPhone application.  The move showed Instagram the demand for an API, and after designing and launching their own asked the rogue API to shut down.  A slightly different scenario, but if API design was copyright this may not have been possible.  We&rsquo;ve seen the same approach with a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/05/25/lack-of-pinterest-api-is-a-lack-of-api-business-strategy/">rogue Pinterest API</a>, but it hasn&rsquo;t resulted in the same response from Pinterest unfortunately.   But community driven API design has a lot of potential for opening up companies and encouraging API innovation.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</ol>
<p>I strongly believe that APIs have massive potential for innovation across many business sectors.  The copyright of API design would eliminate much of this potential.  Open API design allows for healthy competition, interoperability and innovation as we&rsquo;ve seen with cloud and social.  But open API design can also augment the lack of standards through market leadership, helping grow healthy industries and essential online utilities.  Amazon EC2 and S3 design standards are clear examples of this in the wild.</p>
<p>Cloud and social are fast become essential components in our everyday lives, but open API have the potential to become mission critical with implementations like <a href="http://open311.org/">Open311</a>.  Some API designs are just too important to be proprietary.   I would argue Twitter, Amazon S3 and Amazon EC2 also fall into this category and need to remain open for the greater good.</p>
<p>Open API design reuse represents the future of API communication.  Companies like <a title="Singly" href="https://singly.com/">Singly</a>, <a title="Temboo" href="https://www.temboo.com/">Temboo</a>, <a title="Webshell" href="http://webshell.io/">Webshell</a> and <a title="Zapier" href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a> are building API aggregation, automation, and languages that very much rely on flexible API terms of use, as well as API design reuse.  Copyright of API design would prevent companies from openly competing, offering redunancy as well as limit new and more meaningful APIs to be derived from existing API implementations.</p>
<p>Without the ability to copy, mimic, mashup, translate, emulate and re-define API design we won&rsquo;t be able to become more fluent in communicating via web and mobile apps using APIs.  We are just beginning to understand online communication via the power of mobile apps.  As we still grunt and groan while communicating via APIs--let&rsquo;s not stunt our growth and development with allowing API design to be copyrighted.</p>

<p>We are wasting no time getting the&nbsp;<a href="/">API Strategy &amp; Practice conference</a>&nbsp;back on track, after being put on hold because of hurricane Sandy. With the current status of New York City, it&rsquo;s subways, airports, there is no way the event could have happened--we made the right decision to cancel.</p>
<p>We are currently discussing the best dates for rescheduling in January and February of 2013, and are hopeful that we will have date finalized next week.</p>
<p>While we are awaiting that process we figured we&rsquo;d spend some time and discuss the session lineup for the conference. We are rather proud of the keynote, panel and session lineup we&rsquo;ve pulled together, but we feel we can make it even better.</p>
<p>So we are going to hold a Google Hangout today at 11:30 AM PDT / 2:30 PM EDT, to discuss the API Strategy &amp; Practice session lineup and invite you to participate. If you&rsquo;d like to be a participant in the hangout, email me at&nbsp;<a title="kinlane@gmail.com" href="mailto:kinlane@gmail.com">kinlane@gmail.com</a>and if you&rsquo;d like to just watch the hangout, follow&nbsp;<a title="@apistrat" href="https://twitter.com/apistrat">@apistrat</a>&nbsp;and we&rsquo;ll tweet out the Youtube link right before.</p>

        <span class="post-date">30 Oct 2012</span>
        <p>Dear API Strategy Attendee,<br /><br />As you know we've been tracking the weather events affecting New York. Up until now we've been hoping to run the event much as planned and working around the logistics issues that have come up.<br /><br />We were hoping for better news this morning but the situation in New York is still very serious with extensive storm damage, mass-transit and airports with uncertain reopening times and in some areas there are still emergency rescue situations on-going. There has already been significant travel disruption and it looks set to get worse (none of the event team has yet been been able to get to New York and a number of speakers are already unable to fly).<br /><br />As a result we've had to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">take the tough decision to postpone the event and not run it this week</span>. It's very dissapointing for everybody we realize (not least the team) and we'd wanted to fight through and make everything work but as of this time:<br /><br />- We don't think we'd be able to run much of the program and hence the event would<br />&nbsp; not reach the great potential it had.<br /><br />- There are safety concerns and for people traveling very possible serious travel chaos.<br /><br />Lastly, people on the ground in the city likely have other things to focus on than the event - staying safe and securing everything.<br /><br />So if you were planning to travel, please do not - the event won't take place unfortunately. However, this is a postponement and the event will definitely take place - we're committed to making it happen and making it happen in New York. We will get back to you with new dates and consultation in the next few days.<br /><br />We will certainly work with speakers and sponsors to make sure the program is just as good and likely even better + we'll aim to do it as proximately as possible given people's logistics.<br /><br />All tickets will remain valid for the new event when it runs, however if dates do not fit for you we will reimburse you. We'll keep you posted on that news.<br /><br />Our apologies from the team that we've had to take this decision but we really see no other option. We'll be back with news as soon as we can on a new date / time / venue and in the meantime we hope everybody stays safe.<br /><br />We thank everybody for the awesome support and advice -<br /><br />Kin, Steve and Vanessa</p>

<p>When it comes to <a title="API Service Providers" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/06/15/api-service-provider-roundup-for-2012/">API service providers</a>, there is one brand that I would say is widely known, but when we are talking about APIs, often gets overlooked.  That company is Intel.</p>
<p>In addition to a whole suite of SOA and Cloud Middleware, all with an emphasis on security--<a title="REST Web Services &amp; API Security" href="http://cloudsecurity.intel.com/solutions/rest-web-services-api-security">Intel has a REST Web Services Gateway</a>.   This provides a simple solution to the number concern I get from potential API owners:  <strong><em>How do I secure my API?</em></strong></p>
<p>The Intel REST Web Services Gateway provides:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Invoke Security Token Service credential mapping or validation</li>
<li>Ensure throttling and SLAs by REST service</li>
<li>Extend Enterprise audit and compliance to WOA and REST</li>
<li>Detailed XML threat prevention and payload inspection</li>
<li>Service virtualization, proxy, and abstraction as a policy enforcement point</li>
<li>REST API security and management</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find a <a href="http://cloudsecurity.intel.com/white-papers/enterprise-security-for-rest-soap/">summary of the product</a>, a&nbsp;<a href="http://cloudsecurity.intel.com/data-sheets/expressway-service-gateway/">full data sheet</a>, as well as some video tutorials over at <a href="http://cloudsecurity.intel.com/solutions/rest-web-services-api-security">Intel</a>.</p>

<p>If you would like to know more, or have questions make sure and come to <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice</a> this week in NYC.  Intel will have a session on their approach to APIs, as well as be on a panel that I&rsquo;ll be moderating on API service providers. &nbsp;Intel is also a <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/sponsors.php">gold sponsor of API Strategy &amp; Practice</a>--the event wouldn't be happing if it wasn't for Intel. &nbsp;Thanks!</p>
<p>If that isn&rsquo;t enough!  I will also be doing some workshops with Intel at the <a href="http://www.gartner.com/technology/summits/na/applications/">Gartner AADI conference in Las Vegas</a>, the end of November. &nbsp;So you will have another opportunity to speak with both of us.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t make to either New York or Las Vegas, drop me an email and I&rsquo;ll get you in touch with Intel.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/github/github-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" />As with most social platforms, <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> provides oAuth for their platform, allowing developers to provide secure credentials and authentication for their users via a Github account.</p>
<p>Service providers like <a title="Singly" href="https://singly.com/">Singly</a> are providing two click authentication using Github's oAuth.  This allows any website or app to offer their users the ability to login with their Github profile.</p>
<p>Allowing authentication via Github is no brainer for API providers. Why require users to create yet another login, or even use <a href="https://www.singly.com/docs/twitter">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.singly.com/docs/facebook">Facebook</a> oAuth?  Allow them to login and retrieve API keys via the one social profile that reflects the programmer side of their online profile.</p>
<p>Github login can be implemented in any programming language, and because it is oAuth, it is something end users will understand.  In addition to providing easy authentication, you will be able to immediately see other important data about a developer that is available via their Github profile.</p>
<p>Consider the potential of using Github authentication as part of your API strategy.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Oct 2012</span>
        <p><a title="Pearson" href="http://developer.pearson.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/pearson/pearson-logo.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>One API I&rsquo;ve been watching grow and evolve from day one is the <a title="Pearson Developer Community" href="http://developer.pearson.com/">Pearson Developer Community</a>.  I first wrote about them when Peasron <a title="announced a new initiative to build an API platform that give developers access to the publisher's content" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/05/10/pearson-plans-api-platform-to-unlock-content/">announced a new initiative to build an API platform that give developers access to the publisher's content</a> in May of 2011.  Then in <a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2011/08/16/re-inventing-pearson-publishing-using-apis/">August 2011 they launched three APIs</a>:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/longman-dictionary/apimethod/get-entry-0/189/overview">Longman Dictionary</a></strong> - The Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English is the flagship Longman dictionary</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/ft-press/apimethod/get-book-block/189/overview">FT Press</a></strong> - FT Press provides essential insights from the best business books and original writings by leading business thinkers</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/eyewitness-guides/apimethod/entries-guide/189/overview">Eyewitness Guides</a> </strong>- The DK Eyewitness Travel Guides show you what others only tell you</li>
</ul>
<p>After Pearson got acquainted with the ins and outs of API evangelism, and supporting the Pearson developer community, they <a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2012/06/18/launching-apis-one-book-at-a-time/">released two more APIs</a> this year:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/pearson-kitchen-manager/apimethod/courses/190/overview">Pearson Kitchen Manager</a> </strong>- Pearson Kitchen Manager is a valuable resource for food enthusiasts and chefs alike, featuring a vast collection of recipes from bestselling Pearson textbooks of top culinary schools</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/nursing-health-survival-guides-api/apimethod/get-article/189/overview">Nursing &amp; Health Survival Guides API</a> </strong>- The best-selling Pearson Nursing &amp; Health Survival Guide series is the UK's premier quick reference, aide memoire support for health and social care students and professionals while in practice and studying</li>
</ul>
<p>It looks like Pearson is really finding a rhythm with identifying content to make available, as well as the right approach to deploying as APIs. They have 3 more high value publishing APIs available:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/penguin-classics-api/apimethod/get-article-1/189/overview">Penguin Classics API </a></strong>- The Penguin English Library is a collection of 100 of the best novels ever written in the English Language. Classics like Jane Eyre, Dracula and Great Expectations </li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/dkimages-api/apimethod/list-images/189/overview">dkimages API</a> </strong>- The dkimages API is an encyclopaedic collection of 90,000 high-resolution images</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.pearson.com/api/peachpit-visual-quickstart-guides-api/apimethod/get-article-0/190/overview">Peachpit Visual QuickStart Guides API</a></strong> - With more than 12 million copies in print, Visual QuickStart Guides have been a vital part of the computer book category for years</li>
</ul>
<p>That is a total of 8 APIs endpoints Pearson has made available via their developer center--providing some valuable text and image content that developers can use to build web and mobile apps.</p>
<p>What impresses me with Pearson is that they&rsquo;ve found an efficient way to identify valuable assets within legacy inventory, part them out and expose these valuable parts and pieces as APIs.  Essentially giving them a new life--driving web, mobile and tablet applications.</p>
<p>Pearson has deployed their developer center with all the <a title="essential API building blocks" href="/the_building_blocks_of_a_successful_api.php">essential API building blocks</a>, while also executing an efficient API evangelism campaign around their APis, and delivering value to developers.  It&rsquo;s a commendable operation for such a big publisher.</p>
<p>If you are interested in hearing more about what Pearson is up to with their APIs, you can catch them at the <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference this week in NYC</a>.  Pearson will be presenting as part of a media API session as well as helping sponsor the event, to make sure we can all get together an have these conversations.</p>

<p>Code samples in a variety of languages are how API owners help developers understand an API in the language that makes the most sense to them.</p>
<p>Not all developers will understand REST, HTTP and other things you might take for granted.  Very simple code samples will help demonstrate an APIs functionality, making the learning process a hands-on experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> provides a very lightweight tool for publishing API code samples, that can be embedded on any website, called <a title="Gist" href="https://gist.github.com/">Gists</a>.  You can easily copy / paste a working code sample into a Gist and Github returns a lightweight, embeddable JavaScript that you can use in documentation, blog posts and any where you will need to share with users.</p>
<p>Github Gists can be a much sexier, and easier to implement alternative to html &lt;code&gt; tags. While also allowing easy management and versioning of API code samples alongside <a title="Github API SDK Management" href="/2012/10/25/sdk-management-for-your-api-with-github/">Github API SDK repositories</a>.</p>

<p>The most common use of <a title="Github" href="http://www.github.com">Github</a> by API providers is to publish API SDK's to the popular social coding platform.  If you look at most of the the top API providers in operation today, you will find they are actively using Github to not just manage and publicize their API SDK's, but actively interact with their developer ecosystem in the process.</p>
<p>Github provides the necessary workflow for initial design, development and publicizing of API SDKs, allowing owners to create separate repositories for web-based SDKs like PHP, Python and Ruby and mobile SDKs for iOS, Android and Windows mobile.</p>
<p>By making API SDK's public repositories on Github you get all the code management benefits of Github, but also make them available for social interaction by your developers.  They will be able to download, fork and potentially commit additions and modifications back to an SDK's repository, allowing owners to harness the creative potential of the developer community.</p>
<p>Active Github repositories for an API are an essential part of any API ecosystem.  If you don't use Github for anything else, make sure you publish your SDK's as a public repository. It will make the development of your client libraries a much more social experience, providing huge benefits for your API.</p>

<p>I get so busy sometimes my stories pile up. Some only seeing the light of day when I get caught up on research, projects, travels and speaking. On story I&rsquo;ve been meaning to write for almost 3 months now is about <a title="APIPhany" href="http://www.apiphany.com/">APIphany</a>, one of the new generation of API providers.  I met the APIphany team in person when I went out to Washington DC in August.</p>
<p>The APIphany team was cool enough to come out and support my <a title="API Craft Washington DC" href="/2012/08/18/api-craft-washington-dc/">API Craft meetup in DC</a>, then the next morning I went out to their offices and met the rest of the team.  APIphany sees the industry very similar to me, and believe in self-service, pay as you go API services that allow for anyone to innovate around APIs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been watching their progress and they have 3 very cool projects made public so far:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.washingtonpost.com/">Washington Post</a> -</strong> Developer area for Washington Post, providing some endpoints including an Issue Engine API, White House Visitors Log API,  and the Campaign Finance API</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.ridemetro.apiphany.com/">Houston Metro</a> -</strong> Developer portal for the Houston area, providing public transit in the Houston metropolitan area for bus and rail</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developer.votinginfoproject.org/">The Voting Information Project (VIP)</a> </strong>- Offering APIs and developers tools to provide voters with access to customized election information, helping them navigate the voting process and cast an informed vote</li>
</ul>
<p>When I met the team in August, they described how they were building out so many custom projects for customers that were API driven, they decided to standardize their approach and offer a product.  The APIphany API management solution provides all the standard offerings we are getting used to in the space:</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/apiphany/apiphany-team.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Administration Portal</li>
<li>Developer Portal</li>
<li>Key Management</li>
<li>Access Control and Security</li>
<li>Subscriptions and Billing</li>
<li>Monitoring</li>
<li>Analytics and Reporting</li>
</ul>
<p>APIphany also gives you the ability to host the API in a variety of cloud providers, and my favorite is they provide you with an API to manage your API.  The team has been building and managing web APIs for government, enterprise, and non-profit customers since 2006--so they get it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.apiphany.com/">APIphany</a> is also supporting the <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference</a> in New York City, November 1st and 2nd.  If you want to meet the team, you should make sure your there--if not just head over to <a title="apiphany.com" href="http://apiphany.com">apiphany.com</a> to talk with them directly.</p>

<p>While I was <a href="/2012/10/24/my-presentation-to-the-presidential-innovation-fellows/">out in Washington DC this week</a>, one of the Presidential Innovation Fellows in my workshop was from the Department of Energy, and shared one of the best examples of APIs delivering value I&rsquo;ve seen in awhile.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://bioenergykdf.net/">US Department of Energy has developed the Bioenergy Knowledge Discovery Framework</a> (KDF), which is a platform for researchers and engineers from national laboratories, academia, and private industries to upload files, customize information online, and exchange knowledge with each other.</p>
<p>The Bioenergy Knowledge Discovery Framework provides acess to a landmark &ldquo;Billion-Ton&rdquo; bioenergy study on fuel resources, providing a wealth of information from a variety of researchers.   The study generated a large volume of interest, and resulted in numerous requests for raw data disclosure from the researchers.</p>
<p>In response the project deployed a web API, providing direct access to raw data, saving the resources necessary to reach out to researchers as well as the researchers valuable time in processing requests and providing data.</p>
<p>The US Department of Energy estimates they <span style="text-decoration: underline;">saved $882,000</span> in operational costs and researchers valuable time by bundling the API with the bioenergy study.</p>
<p>This is why I evangelize APIs.  The US Department of Energy case study demonstrates not just the value of APIs, but how they can actually make government more efficient and save tax payers money.</p>
<p>In addition I strongly advocate that&nbsp;<a title="APIs and raw data access should be default" href="http://kinlane.com/2012/05/15/diving-deeper-into-data-from-research/">APIs and raw data access should be default</a> for all studies and resulting reports, allowing anyone to dive deeper into the research and provide additional insights.</p>

<p>Out of date API documentation is by far the most common mistake API providers make, and also the <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2010/08/12/web-api-documentation-best-practices/">number one pain point for API developers</a>.  It makes sense that you will want to keep your API documentation in sync with each version of your API, and one way to handle this is to version them both, using Github.</p>
<p>To use Github for your API documentation, all you need to do is create an single public repository, which you can use to manage HTML versions of your API docs.  By putting your API documentation in its own repository you can keep the version of the API code repository in sync with it's corresponding documentation.</p>
<p>With the API documentation in Github, you can then easily publish to your API area or just allow developers to go directly to the Github repository and browse documentation there.</p>
<p>To help you edit your API documentation, you can use tools like <a href="http://prose.io/">prose.io</a>,&nbsp;which will allow even non-developers to assist in maintaining API documentation, with all changes stored neatly in a central Github repository.</p>
<p>Storing API docs in Github will also make them more portable.  Some developers may wish to download a copy for offline work, or just prefer having locally for their own reference.</p>
<p>With the right approach to managing your API docs with Github, you can easily keep them up to date, in sync with your API, while also making them easily accessible by all API consumers--without much of the headache often associated with managing API documentation.</p>

<p>I spent two hours with a handful of the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/innovationfellows">Presidential Innovation Fellows</a> in Washington DC yesterday.  They were some super savvy folks from a wide variety of agencies and backgrounds including education, energy and health.</p>
<p>During my two hours with them I walked through several areas of  the API industry, from my perspective, including:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>History of APIs</li>
<li>API Planning &amp; Design</li>
<li>API Development</li>
<li>Business of APIs</li>
<li>API Service Providers</li>

If you&rsquo;d like a custom presentation on it, let me know and I&rsquo;ll see if I can find a slot to do a Google Hangout.</p>
<p>I had a blast talking to the Presidential Fellows, and I hope that I left them with some value that will help them be successful in their various initiatives.  They are already halfway through their sprint, and have a lot of expectations put on them.</p>
<p>I will be following their progress closely and publish any stories I can on their progress.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span></p>

<li><strong>API Garbage Littering the Internet</strong> - With some of the tools, making it easier to deploy APIs, the potential to just post meaningless and worthless data sets grows</li>
<li><strong>Lack of API Ownership </strong>- There are big movements to get APIs deployed, but then very little ownership once its up.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regarding worthless APIs being deployed, I think we can mitigate this by providing some sort of ranking or voting systems for APIs, allowing developers to upvote or downvote and add some critical feedback on what is right, or what is wrong.  This will allow the &ldquo;cream&rdquo; to rise to the top, and everything else just disappear from view.</p>
<p>Next, her perspective on lack of API ownership after an API is launched, is a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">very big problem</span>.  It is something I see in the public sector all the time.  Everyone gets excited about standing up an API, but once it&rsquo;s in the wild, they lose enthusiasm--leaving the API to whither on the vine.</p>
<p>APIs will not succeed if they do not have an owner.  For technology companies, it might make sense for them to have an API as a product, assemble a team and dedicate resources to the API. &nbsp;Even hire an evangelist or advocate.</p>
<p>When it comes to government, maybe we need a different approach.  A sort of personal API deployment platform like <a title="Socrata API Foundry" href="http://www.socrata.com/api-foundry/">Socrata API Foundry</a>, that will let anyone publish a dataset as API--allowing any individual to achieve "machine readable by default", as <a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2012/06/01/barak-obama-directs-all-federal-agencies-to-have-an-api/">directed by President Obama back in May</a>.</p>
<p>By empowering data owners within government to publish themselves, and give them the tools to handle the business of their APIs, and interact directly with consumers, maybe we can ensure APIs have an owner--one that cares about the data and truly understand the value it offers.</p>
<p>Just some quick thoughts, from a great conversation.  I will flush out more ideas on this as soon as I can.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/10/24/a-hackathon-philosophy-from-warren-wilbee-of-microsoft/">A Hackathon Philosophy From Warren Wilbee of Microsoft</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">24 Oct 2012</span>
        <p><a href="https://twitter.com/wwilbee" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/microsoft/warren-wilbee-microsoft.jpeg" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>While doing the weekly hackathon roundup in September, I noticed an uptick in the number of <a title="Windows 8 Hackathons" href="http://whosin.com/pg/whois/20074247/Warren+Wilbee">Windows 8 hackathons</a> that are going on.  I decided to reach out to Microsoft and see if I can get more information on what they are trying to accomplish, and see what their perspective is on hackathons.</p>
<p>After talking to several people I was directed to a gentleman by the name of Warren Wilbee (<a href="https://twitter.com/wwilbee" target="_blank">@wwilbee</a>), Director of ISV Evangelism at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx">Microsoft</a>.  Wilbee is a passionate evangelist, one that isn't just externally evangelizing, he is actively working to evolve internal culture and options about the value of hackathons at Microsoft.  When I got on the phone with him, he said the reason I was directed to him is because he had recently circulated an internal memo regarding the makeup and value of hackathons.</p>
<p>He feels strong that hackathons are very useful, you get the opportunity to get X number of people into a room, doing exactly what you want--delivering a very direct result. "Hackathons are purpose built", when you put on a hackathon for developers you get to define exactly what you, sending the desired message your company wants developers to receive, says Wilbee. By contrast, sponsoring a hackathon is a very different exercise and value proposition--proceed with caution.  The hackathon organizer gets to define the purpose and drive the outcomes. The sponsor will not have access to this value, potentially excluding you from all the marketing or social "halo" produced at the event.  Sometimes there are opportunities to offer a prize that will be in-line with the organizers purpose, but just flashing your logo will not deliver much value to your company.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.devcamps.ms/"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/microsoft/windows-8-hackathons.jpeg" alt="" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>When you do put on a hackathon, Wilbee is passionate about it being a "participatory event". Get your people to come and participate, don't just require them to show up, make it part of their responsibility to be involved.  There is a social and community aspect to hackathons, "the shared experience of being in a room at 3am, committed to a common goal is a galvanizing, bonding experience." This is something you get by just showing up for a short period of time or just sponsoring an event.</p>
<p>In Wilbee&rsquo;s opinion APIs and software platforms are here to stay, and hackathons do a great job educating people about the value they deliver.  We will definitely see more organized efforts around these types of events, across many business sectors, in the future.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/10/22/open-source-your-api-with-github/">Open Source Your API With Github</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">22 Oct 2012</span>
        <p><a title="Github" href="https://github.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/github/github-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a title="Github" href="https://github.com/">Github</a>&nbsp;is a frequently used service in the toolbox of API owners.  The most common use of Github is for publishing API SDKs in a variety of languages and platforms.  But when it comes to truly being an "open API", some API owners are actually open sourcing their API design using Github.</p>
<p>Open sourcing the design of your API will not be sensible for every provider.  Many companies are looking to ensure developers use their API, maintaining an advantage over competitors.  However in some cases, open sourcing the design of your API is a way to ensure interoperability between partners or among mutliple companies within a certain business sector.</p>
<p>Simple examples of an API design might be for common systems like blogs, news, links, calendars or other API designs that don't deliver any sort of proprietary offerings.  If you are looking to ensure synchronicity between say, the calendar of multiple organizations, developing a single API and open sourcing the design and possibly a version of it in multiple programming languages, might make sense.</p>
<p>With a consistent API design, and code to deploy the API, any organization can download or fork the Github code, deploy the API for themselves--ensuring consistency and interoperability between any deployment. If a single organizations has unique needs, they can extend and commit the code back to Github, allowing the central repository manager to decide if it is a change that should be added to the core offering.</p>
<p>Not all APIs are created equal. &nbsp;Consider the possibility of actually open sourcing your API, the benefits it might bring to others, as well as your organization--they might exceed keeping it closed and proprietary.</p>
<p>This approach to using Github, is by far the truest meaning of the word, "Open API".</p>

<p>When <a href="/2012/10/20/the-right-partnership-for-the-api-strategy--practice-conference/">3Scale and I first decided to do the API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference</a> in New York, one of the first people I reached out to about speaking and sponsoring the event, was Laura Merling (<a href="https://twitter.com/magicmerl">@magicmerl</a>), SVP Applications Enablement Platform and Strategy at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.alcatel-lucent.com/open-api-platform/">Alcatel-Lucent</a>.</p>
<p>As soon as I told her about the event, she said &ldquo;We are in! What do we need to do, to support it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m stoked to have Laura kick off the event on Thursday, November 1st with a keynote as well as having <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/sponsors.php">Alcatel-Lucent as a gold sponsor.</a></p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve never heard Laura speak, I highly recommend making sure you are there.  She always has great insight into the success Alcatel-Lucent is having within emerging markets and the telco space. &nbsp;Also, her talks are always positive, energetic and demonstrate leadership in the space--something I want my daughter Kaia to experience.</p>
<p>During Laura&rsquo;s keynote I&rsquo;m sure we will here more about <a href="/2012/09/06/alcatel-lucent-open-sources-their-api-management-platform/">Alcatel-Lucent's new open source offering, API Grove</a>, as well as their openly licensed <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/16/alcatel-lucent-creates-methodology-for-apis-and-makes-available-under-creative-commons/">API lifecycle and methodology</a>.</p>
<p>Make sure you <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/register.php">get registered</a> today, before the event is sold out--there aren&rsquo;t many tickets left. &nbsp;I'll see you there.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference</a> is kicking off in 12 days in New York City.  The event will be keynotes, sessions and panels from over <a title="60 leading individuals across all sectors of the API industry" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/speakers.php">60 leading individuals across all sectors of the API industry</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve wanted to have an API industry event that was about ideas, practice and strategy, not just about companies, their products and clients for a while now.  This is something that I could never achieve on my own.  I just don&rsquo;t have the money or all the connections to bring everyone together.</p>
<p>To make API Strategy &amp; Practice happen it took the right partnership.  That partnership is with <a title="API service provider 3Scale" href="http://www.3scale.net/">API service provider 3Scale</a>.  The 3Scale team views the industry much like I do, that by openly educating people about the benefits of APIs and discussing the technical, business and political challenges we face in the industry--we can truly make change across all business sectors. &nbsp;Allowing all of us to be succesful in whatever products and services we provide.</p>
<p>Through the regular discussion I have with the 3Scale team, we discovered our shared desire to have such an API industry event.  We discussed what the event would look like, then quickly started figuring out what it would take to make it happen.  We felt we both had resources necessary to pull it off, and even though there is a lot of risk, that it was something that had to happen, for the benefit of the industry.</p>
<p>Here we are, 8 weeks later, and the event is a reality.   I just wanted to say thanks to 3Scale for not just sharing my vision of the API industry, but also partnering with me to make this event a reality.  I hope all my readers can make it to the event and participate in the discussions about APIs, platforms, mobile, and how we can all work to solve the biggest challenges in the space. &nbsp;This discussion will allow all of us to make significant change across all business sectors and at all levels of government using APIs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Oct 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/open.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>When I set out to put on an API industry event in early 2012, I had grand visions of what it would be.  Getting everyone together to discuss the best ideas, approaches the  industry has to offer--while also discussing the critical topics such as open APIs, developer rights, monetization, etc.</p>
<p>Fast forward 10 months, and the event is a reality, and even though it doesn&rsquo;t exactly look like I imagined, it is damn close--with&nbsp;<a title="lots of amazing API discussions" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/sessions.php">lots of amazing API discussions</a>.</p>
<p>After I <a title="API event has 60 speakers" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/speakers.php">announced the event has 60 speakers</a>&nbsp;yesterday,  I saw a tweet from Dave Winer (<a title="@DaveWiner" href="https://twitter.com/davewiner">@davewiner</a>):</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" style="padding-left: 35px;">
<p>A conference about APIs with only speakers representing corporate APIs. Not one open API, so no interop. Lost.<a title="http://0ox.r2.ly/" href="http://t.co/VBmfy5nb">0ox.r2.ly</a></p>

<script src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
<p>Now for those of you who don&rsquo;t read entire posts, I&rsquo;m NOT going after Dave.  We&rsquo;ve already tweeted back and forth and discussed, and he is supportive.  This post is about my feelings and thoughts on "open", and how we can all work together to make sure the industry is as open as possible.</p>
<p>First, I don&rsquo;t see things as black and white.  When it comes to politics, life or the API industry.  To ability to snap our fingers and everything becomes open will not happen.  It will be a lot of hard work and be very painful.</p>
<p>Next, I can honestly say there isn&rsquo;t anyone else in the space who is dedicated to open APIs as much as I am.  Sure Dave is much bigger name and has more history on this, but this is ALL I do.  Period.  I don&rsquo;t work on anything else. It is my day and night job.</p>
<p>I have written constantly about the need for <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/04/04/open-building-blocks-for-an-api/">open API building blocks</a>, <a title="open API billing and traffic control" href="/2011/05/21/open-source-api-billing-and-traffic-control/">open API billing and traffic control</a>, all while constantly <a title="what open even means" href="http://apivoice.com/2012/05/30/public-api-vs-open-api/">asking what open even means</a>?  My evangelism has helped guide two of the service providers in the space to deliver the first enterprise grade open source API products, from <a title="WSO2" href="http://wso2.com/products/api-manager/">WSO2</a> and <a title="Alcatel-Lucent" href="http://apigrove.net/">Alcatel-Lucent</a>. &nbsp;While these products aren't everything I want, they are a start.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a firm believer in constantly discussing what &ldquo;open&rdquo; means.  Is it free access, write capabilities, TOS, open source software under the hood, distributed technology, embracing open standards or is it just using the word, as many people feel comfortable with.  Through these open and honest conversations, I firmly believe we&rsquo;ll educate people and change their opinions one by one.</p>
<p>This is one of my goals at the <a title="API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference</a>.  At first glance it is easy to think the event might appear to be a corporate API lovefest, but let&rsquo;s scratch the surface a little bit:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Steve Klabnik</strong> - His keynote title is &ldquo;Why Open?&rdquo;&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Singly</strong> - I don&rsquo;t know anyone who cares more about open access to personal data than Singly&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Swagger</strong> - Tony and the gang are building amazing open source tools that facilitate API development</li>
<li><strong>Kirsten Jones</strong> - Kirsten&rsquo;s talk on educating owners and devs about HTTP is critical to the standard being used consistently across industry&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Temboo &amp; Webshell </strong>- These guys entire business rely upon open TOS allowing them to aggregate APIs and their existence provides real pressure for API owners to open up&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Hack Education</strong> - I&rsquo;m biased here.  But there is nobody in education working as tirelessly as my girlfriend Audrey Watters to open up data that is locked in education silos</li>
<li><strong>Donors Choose</strong> - An online charity that provides open data and APIs to make classrooms better&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Seabourne</strong> -  Seabourne has a suite of open source and open API products like Cumula that are transforming the government and making it more open and transparent</li>
<li><strong>Digital Strategy</strong> - I will be showcasing all the open tools, data and API initiatives across federal agencies--spearheaded by the GSA</li>
</ul>
<p>That is 10 out of 60 of the session and keynote speakers bringing open discussions to the table. &nbsp;There are also three panels that are purposefully designed to discuss open:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Building Great APIs: Do&rsquo;s and Don&rsquo;ts&nbsp;</li>
<li>API Business Models&nbsp;</li>
<li>APIs Platforms and Business Model Tradeoffs</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see there will be plenty of "open" discussions at API Strategy &amp; Practice--I&rsquo;m sure I could extract more if I had time.&nbsp;I would love to be able to have a perfectly open API industry and perfectly open API event, where everyone agreed on what open was, widely used open standards and came together to truly make the industry the best it can be.  But it doesn&rsquo;t exist.  We have to create it incrementally.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/index.php"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/api-strategy-practice-conference/api-strategy-home-1.png" alt="" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>API Strategy &amp; Practice took corporate sponsorship to make sure everyone has an event to come to.  Then we got to work bringing together the best minds (yes some corporate running closed APIs), to work together and discuss all the issues across a multitude of industries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m 100% dedicated to the concept "open".  I don&rsquo;t work for any corporation, I&rsquo;m 100% independent so that I can have the loudest, most unrestrained voice possible. And I am dedicated&nbsp;to making sure the event is about the community, ideas, strategy and real discussions about the toughest challenges we face in the space.</p>
<p>If you aren&rsquo;t there, participating in these discussions, I&rsquo;m afraid we are losing an important voice, and that is a lost opportunity.  So please contact me if you wish to be there.  I will make sure you get in. &nbsp;Otherwise, you will miss your chance to convince some of the folks who might not see open, in the same way you do.</p>

<p>I finished updating the <a title="speaker linup" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/speakers.php">speaker lineup</a> for the <a title="API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference</a> this weekend.  While we still have a couple of panels to finalize and keynotes to announce, the speaker lineup is almost final.</p>
<p>We have spent almost 8 weeks reaching out to leaders across the API industry, soliciting submissions for keynotes, panels and sessions.  It has been a lot of fun taking all the submissions and crafting the most compelling schedule as possible.</p>
<p>It was really important to me that we didn&rsquo;t just&nbsp;discuss the common areas of the API industry, like service providers, REST, etc.  Not that these aren&rsquo;t relevant--they are!  But I wanted to make sure we discuss some areas that are critical to the space, but do not get much airtime.  Topics like API design and API life-cycle methodologies.</p>
<p>I feel it is also critical to discuss where we are going, by covering topics like API automation, aggregation and building of programming frameworks on top of numerous APIs--trends that will allow us leap forward in how we consume and build apps on top of APIs.</p>
<p>In the next two weeks I will be going through our lineup in detail and talking about the various API session tracks like music, social, payments, government and education to name a few prominent session areas.</p>
<p><a title="API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/api-strategy-practice-conference/api-strategy-home-1.png" alt="" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>While I started getting excited about this event back in August, it is really starting to get real.  I&rsquo;m really psyched about how this event has come together.  There will only be 250-300 people at the event, so it&rsquo;s going to be a very intimate opportunity for network with these API industry leaders.</p>
<p>Make sure and <a title="register for the API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/register.php">register for the API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference</a> ASAP, and I look forward to seeing you there.</p>

<p>As part of my research into how to create <a title="Healthy Developer communities" href="http://kinlane.com/blog/tag.php?Search_Tag=HealthyDevs">healthy developer communities</a>, I've been spending time reaching out to organizers of developer meetups in different cities so I can get some insight into what it takes to successfully organize and run a developer meetup.</p>
<p>I recently spoke to Jeremia Kimelman (<a href="https://twitter.com/jeremiak">@jeremiak</a>)&nbsp;of <a title="Tout" href="http://www.tout.com/">Tout</a>, who runs <a title="Mobile Developer Mondays" href="http://www.meetup.com/momolabs/">Mobile Monday Developers</a>. Jeremia took over the Mobile Monday Developers with the idea that he would create a meet up format where tech companies could reach out to developers in a non-spammy way.  Companies could sponsor workshops and come in to deliver on topics like HTML5 or HTML5 vs Native Apps, and do it in a way that would add value to developers worlds.</p>
<p>This is a model that I'm sure many tech companies would drool over, and very often view meetups as a perfect medium for this type of sales pitch.  As I reach out to meet up organizers I get the vibe that many of them already get solicited by companies in this fashion--either because they don't respond at all, or by being somewhat hostile to my questions about their meetup.</p>
<p><a title="Tout" href="http://www.tout.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/healthy-developers/Tout.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Jeremia was able to grow his meet ups from about 40 to 140 members with this model, but when I asked him if this was a model that could be replicated, he replied, "definitely not".  It doesn't create value. It doesn't solve the problems developers face and ultimately will doom your meetup to failure.</p>
<p>As platform and API owners it's easy to drink our own kool-aid and think what we are offering is what developers want.  Jeremia said it's easy to project your business understanding onto developers, and assume they are concerned with things like monetization and in-app payments, when in reality these things might be the furthest thing from their minds.</p>
<p>In an effort to truly deliver value to developers, Jeremia decided to pivot, working to better understand better how to make it a community owned event. By actually solving the problems developers face, making the event truly about learning and growth--not about what we perceive developers will need, and our products.</p>
<p>Not all developers are created equal.  iPhone developers won't see things the same way as Android devs, and Windows mobile developers are going to have way different needs than others.  "Don't try to be everything to everyone", said Jeremia.</p>
<p><a title="Meetups" href="http://www.meetup.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/meetup/meetup_logo.gif" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>To make it about developers and to introduce community into the meetup he is playing around with letting attendees share the problems they personally face as developers, letting the group openly discuss the problem, provide solutions and help each other learn and grow.  This has the potential to bring value and community to the meetup in an organic way, not something that is imposed by him or a company.</p>
<p>As API or platform evangelists I think it's easy to be self-centered, making hackathons and meet ups all about us. &nbsp;When in reality we should be actively working to just support developers as they are. &nbsp;We need to work with them to understand the problems they face, and help them find solutions--even if the solutions are not our products and services.</p>
<p>In the end, if the developers are successful and we helped them get there.  It will go a long way in building trust, something that can't be established when just evangelizing or selling our company to developers at meetups around the country.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Oct 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/federal-government/innovation-fellows/PresidentialInnovationFellows.jpeg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was honored this month to receive an invitation from Todd Park (<a title="Todd Park" href="https://twitter.com/todd_park">@todd_park</a>), the U.S. Chief Technology Officer, on behalf of the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/innovationfellows">Presidential Innovation Fellows Program</a>, to come out to Washington DC and spend an afternoon coaching and working with some of the Presidential Innovation Fellows on the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/innovationfellows/opendata">Open Data Initiatives</a> project.</p>
<p>The Presidential Innovation Fellows program brings together top innovators from the private&nbsp;sector, nonprofits, and academia with top innovators in government to collaborate on solutions that aim to deliver significant results in six months, while being supported by a broader community of interested citizens throughout the country.</p>
<p>The objective of the OpenData Initiatives are centered around:</p>
<blockquote><em>Stimulating a rising tide of innovation and entrepreneurship that utilizes government data to create tools that help Americans in numerous ways</em></blockquote>
<p>Working with the Innovation Fellows is just one areas I&rsquo;m <a title="working to change the way our government works using APIs" href="/federal_government.php">working to change the way our government works using APIs</a>.  I strongly feel that opening up our government, and evolving how it operates using web APIs is fundamental in bringing democracy into the 21st century.</p>
<p>While speaking with the Innovation Fellows I will cover the usual material I have published here on API Evangelist:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="History of APIs" href="/blog/tag.php?Search_Tag=History">History of APIs</a></strong> - Brief overview of the modern web API movement</li>
<li><strong><a title="API Building Blocks" href="/buildingblocks/">API Building Blocks</a> </strong>- The essential building blocks to a successful API</li>
<li><strong><a title="Service Providers" href="/serviceproviders/">API Service Providers</a></strong> - Roundup of the service providers who can help deploy APIs</li>
<li><strong><a title="API Tools" href="/apitools/">API Tools</a></strong> - Pull together list of tools that can be used to design, deploy and manage APIs</li>
<li><strong><a title="API Industries" href="/industries/">Industries</a></strong> - Some of the top industries putting APIs to use</li>
<li><strong><a title="Hackathons" href="http://hackweekends.com/">Hackathons</a></strong> - How hackathons are being used to drive innovation</li>
</ul>
<p>My intentions are to help share everything I know with the fellows to make sure they are well equipped to execute as part of the OpenData Initiatives.  APIs will be the underlying technology that stimulates innovation and the interface that allows Americans to develop tools that utilizes government data.</p>
<p>APIs won&rsquo;t just be the underlying technology that drives this, the philosophies and methodologies that have fueled the current web API movement will be essential in changing culture in washington.  APIs have the potential to allow federal agencies to take inventory of the rich data and content they posses, and open up government, making their day to day operations much more public, and a truly participatory process.</p>
<p>This process won&rsquo;t be giving the folks who run our government another thing to learn or do, it will allow them share much of heavy lifting associated with day to day operations with the public, corporations and nonprofits--leaving them much more nimble to accomplish their core mission.  APIs aren&rsquo;t just about technology change, they are about cultural change, and have the potential to be the change we want to see in washington.</p>
<p>As I prepare my thoughts to go out to DC I wanted to put it out to my readers and see what you feel I should share with the Innovation Fellows about the API space.  What do they need to know to make their six month iniatives as impactful as possible?  How can I best distill down everything we&rsquo;ve learned in the public space about openness, transparency and developer ecosystems, so they get the true essence of this movement?</p>

<span>We saw major enhancements coming down the pipes with IOS 5 and Mac OS X Lion. What really stood out was their new <a title="iCloud" href="http://www.apple.com/icloud/">iCloud</a>.</span><p></p>
<span>iCloud is free, seamless storage in the cloud for documents and everything else you use on your Mac and IOS devices.</span><p></p>
<span>This means documents you've written, presentations you've prepared are available on any IOS device. You can view and edit the same document, in its latest state, on all your devices. And since iCloud automatically updates any changes you make, you don't even have to remember to save your work. </span><p></p>
<span>iCloud will also have a full set of APIs for developers to take advantage of, allowing them to implement iCloud storage, sync, and backup for documents into any application.</span><p></p>
<span>Apple's iCloud represents a continued evolution of the file system from being local to existing on the Internet and available on any device. This means that all design, collaboration, publishing and printing will move off the desktop as well. </span><p></p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/10/12/the-api-evangelist-mission/">The API Evangelist Mission</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">12 Oct 2012</span>
        <p><a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/api-evangelist-logo-400.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Many folks who encounter <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> think I'm working to evangelize a single API. &nbsp;I field so many questions about this I thought I would address by publishing an API Evangelist mission statement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The mission of API Evangelist is to educate business, nonprofit and government leaders about the value of APIs to their organizations.</p>
<p>API Evangelist is made up of four properties:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>API Evangelist </strong>(<a href="http://apievangelist.com">apievangelist.com</a>) - Business of APIs</li>
<li><strong>API Voice</strong> (<a href="http://apivoice.com">apivoice.com</a>) - Politics of APIs</li>
<li><strong>API Stack</strong> (<a href="http://theapistack.com">theapistack.com</a>) - API discovery and ranking </li>
<li><strong>Hack Weekends</strong> (<a href="http://hackweekends.com">hackweekends.com</a>) - Hackathon news and calendar</li>
</ul>
<p>With API Evangelist I strive to be the independent voice for the industry, providing the public with information about API:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a title="API Building Blocks" href="/buildingblocks/">Building Blocks</a></li>
<li><a title="API Service Providers" href="/serviceproviders/">Service Providers</a></li>
<li><a title="API Industries" href="/industries/">Industries</a></li>
<li><a title="API Tools" href="/apitools/">Tools</a></li>
<li><a title="API News" href="/news/">News</a></li>
<li><a title="API Analysis" href="/blog/">Analysis</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The goal is to provide a wealth of resources for those looking to design, develop and deploy APIs without bias towards a specific platform--allowing them to make an educated choice about what path they should take.</p>
<p>To stay independent and operate API Evangelist, I need to bring in revenue, and keep things moving forward.  I strive to do this in as healthy of a way as possible, without giving away control over my attention and focus, and contribute as much as possible to resources I provide to the public.</p>
<p>Areas I currently offer consulting services in are:</p>
<p><strong>Strategy</strong></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>API Evangelism</strong> - Design and oversight of companies API evangelism efforts</li>
<li><strong>Monetization Strategy</strong> - Design and oversight of a companies API monetization, business model and incubation approaches</li>
<li><strong>Hackathons</strong> - Targeting, planning and execution of hackathons</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Research</strong></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Industry</strong> - Analysis of specific industries, API providers within and the opportunities available</li>
<li><strong>Markets</strong> - Identifying and deeper understanding of evangelism opportunities within specific cities and countries</li>
<li><strong>Developer Profiling</strong> - Targeting and profiling of developers within industries, markets and of specific, existing APIs</li>
<li><strong>Providers</strong> - Providing a deeper understanding of how specific APIs operate their API operations</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Speaking</strong></p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Webinars</strong> - Participating in webinars with companies and individuals</li>
<li><strong>Conferences</strong> - Speaking and presenting at technology conferences</li>
<li><strong>Meetups</strong> - Speaking and participating at local meetups</li>
<li><strong>Workshops</strong> - Design and execution of workshops at existing events</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these consulting areas are design to provide as much value to the client, while amplifying the signal and content via the four API Evangelist properties, and other syndication opportunities, under a <a title="Creative Commons License" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">creative commons license</a>--enabling the public to consume and provide the greatest possible good for the API industry.</p>
<p>I feel strongly that a wealth of open resources will help ensure a fast growing and healthy industry by educating non-developers, non-technical business leaders about the benefits of APIs and healthy developer and partner ecosystem.</p>
<p>Please let me know how you can help support me in what I do, providing the industry with the information it needs to be successful, while also giving you what you need to successfully provide the services you offer.</p>
<p>This <a href="http://kinlane.com/mission.php">mission statement is a permanent fixture on my central kinlane.com site</a>, it''s not just the API Evangelist mission, it is my mission.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Oct 2012</span>
        <p><a title="NPR" href="http://www.npr.org/"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/npr/npr-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>NPR is defining new models for content distribution. One that other media providers can follow, when designing their API driven content delivery platforms.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://dev.npr.org/">NPR Story API</a> provides digital access to NPR content and to other station content--allowing both NPR and stations to contribute and consume local and national news stories.</p>
<p>In an effort to provide NPR stations with more control over the content they contribute to the platform for distribution, <a href="http://digitalservices.npr.org/post/npr-api-content-permissions-control">NPR Digital Services has introduced content permissions control via the NPR story API</a>.</p>
<p>Currently content stored on the  Story API&rsquo;s platform can be retrieved by anyone with an API key--allowing content pushed across the network to be consumedd in 3 ways:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Create Once, Publish Everywhere</strong> - Stations and npr.org push content into the API and then pull the content onto other platforms, such as other station-owned web properties and mobile apps</li>
<li><strong>Station Networks</strong> - Content is shared between multiple stations in a content network, both on web sites and mobile apps</li>
<li><strong>National</strong> - Station content is featured on npr.org and NPR mobile apps with links back to station digital properties</li>
</ul>
<p>Using the new content permissions, stations can now control who is allowed to pull their content from the API.  The permissions work by allowing stations pushing content to specify whether the content should be:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Public to all</li>
<li>Public to the NPR station network</li>
<li>Public to a group of stations listed in a whitelist </li>
<li>Public to everyone except for stations on a blacklist</li>
</ul>
<p>The new changes allow stations to set these permissions at the individual story level, as well as create permission groups to add multiple stories to.</p>
<p>NPR's approach is a great model for how APIs can facilitate content exchange across a large network of providers, allowing for the widest distribution possible-while also allowing content owners control over who has access to their valuable content in a very granular way.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/npr/NPR-Digital-Services.png" alt="" width="450" /></p>
<p>APIs are all about providing access to valuable content and resources, but should also be designed to give the proper amount of access, so your content doesn&rsquo;t end up being consumed, distributed in ways you don&rsquo;t find appropriate.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Oct 2012</span>

<p>Marketing to developers is no straightforward task, and with the growth in the number of APIs, platforms, tools and active evangelists and advocates, it is only going to get harder.</p>
<p>Developers just don&rsquo;t want to be sold anything.  We just want to do what we do, and just be left alone--until we need help and reach out.  Then we need you to be there.</p>
<p>With <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> I&rsquo;m evangelizing the importance of APIs to a wider audience beyond developers, while also helping companies understand how they can market their services to developers.</p>
<p>Helping non-developers understand about APIs is getting easier each month, while helping API owners market to developers is getting harder.</p>
<p>Many companies are even opting to not use the term advocate or evangelist, as these names are beginning to have a negative impression with developers.</p>
<p>Developers are bombarded by one or many evangelists, everywhere they go, and many of these evangelists are more sales and marketing than developer support--giving everyone a bad name.</p>
<p>If you are looking to evangelize your API in the near future, deeply consider your approach.  Your objective is not to sell developers on your API, but to help them be successful in what they are doing--something that may or may not involve your companies API.</p>
<p>Your only option for evangelism is to be as authentic as possible and truly solve the problems developers face, otherwise developers will look elsewhere--and with the increased competition, developers have a growing number of options when it comes to APIs and platforms to get the job done.</p>

<p>Chris and I will be exploring a couple are of specific areas, regarding the business of APIs:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Emerging API economy and digital business ecosystems</li>
<li>How to assemble the building blocks of a successful API</li>
<li>When a complete open source API management platform delivers business value</li>
<li>Future trends in maximizing the value of APIs</li>
</ul>
<p>WSO2 brings a wealth of API experience to the table and I look forward to exploring these areas with Chris.

        <span class="post-date">06 Oct 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/github/github-logo-transparent.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>There is a lot of news about social networks in the last couple of weeks, with <a href="http://go.bloomberg.com/tech-blog/2012-10-04-facebook-grows-to-1-billion-users-creates-video-to-show-global-reach/">Facebook reaching 1B users</a>, a <a href="http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/myspace_gets_new_look_stays_true_to_its_roots">brand new look for MySpace</a> giving people hope for the struggling social network, the <a title="great twitter migration to app.net" href="http://apivoice.com/2012/10/04/has-the-great-twitter-migration-to-app.net-begun/">great Twitter migration to App.net</a> and what a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/technology/dick-costolo-of-twitter-an-improv-master-writing-its-script.html">master of improv Dick Costolo is, writing Twitters script</a>.</p>
<p>All of these news items are in some way trying to convince us of what the future of social networking will look like, declaring Twitter, Facebook, MySpace and App.net as a contender.  While all of these social networks aren&rsquo;t going anywhere, I think there is one social network that represents the future of all social networks--<a title="Github" href="https://github.com/">Github</a>.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know what Github is, you probably aren&rsquo;t a programmer.  Github is a social network built around the software version control software <a title="Git" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)">Git</a>. &nbsp;Using Github, programmers can collaborate around repositories of code, which allows them to download, fork and commit back code in any format--making software development a social endeavor amongst potentially thousands of developers.</p>
<p>While Github is primarily a social network of programmers, repositories don&rsquo;t have to be just code.  Github repositories can contain HTML, text files and many other formats that can be edited by anybody--allowing the power of version control and collaboration to occur between anyone, in any business sector.</p>
<p>I just finished watching <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/en/clay_shirky_how_the_internet_will_one_day_transform_government.html">Clay Shirky&rsquo;s talk on how the Internet will (one day) transform government</a>, using the platform to deal with a flood of new, often times divergent, ideas.  As always, Clay masterfully uses history to lay the groundwork for his argument, that social collaboration and version control with Github is in alignment with how democracy should work.</p>
<p>While Twitter and Facebook have proven to evoke profound social change, I think Github holds amazing potential for change as well. And whether it is allowing developers to build open source software, government to make the legal process truly inclusive of its citizens or <a title="empowering teachers to collaborate on curriculum with Github" href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2012/07/16/github-for-education-revisited/">empowering our teachers to collaborate on classroom curriculum</a>--Github holds an amazing amount of untapped potential.</p>
<p>Github opens up unlimited possibilities for much more constructive and meaningful social interactions than we&rsquo;ve seen with Twitter and Facebook. &nbsp;Social interactions that will allow anyone to benefit from the successful aspects of open source software development--unleasing a new era of social networking and collaboration.</p>

<p>Hackathons are a popular way for developers to come together and hack on mobile and web apps, in hopes of winning prizes and getting noticed for their innovation.  Silicon Valley has done a great job of keeping hackathons about building apps, but there are many other ways to apply the hackathon model.</p>
<p>One hackathon model that I&rsquo;ve seen a couple times now, is more about hacking a process, rather than hacking an app.  A hackathon where any company, organization or individual can come, with their existing process, and walk participants through what they are looking to accomplish--with the goal of making it better.</p>
<p>The process could be anything they already do on a regular basis and are looking to optimize, or a new process they would like to develop. In our ever-increasing digital world, where Software as a Service (SaaS) and APIs are becoming commonplace in our daily lives, there is an need for constantly identifying, refining and establishing new processes.</p>
<p>APIs open up huge opportunities for more efficient ways of getting things done, and a hackathon is a great way to pitch a process to a bunch of new users, form teams and spend some time hacking together a more efficient way to get it done.  The objective of this form of the hackathon is to refine a process and help make it better, using technology to better solve the problems we deal with every day.</p>
<p>While building apps is a great focus of a hackathon, they might be better used to help people gain efficiencies at their companies and organizations--allowing them to get access to creative new approaches, and knowledge about other potential tools and platforms they can put to use. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I predict hackathons will continue to grow in popularity, and hopefully we can continue to evolve them to reach the widest possible audience. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The Tumblr engineering team has been hard at work on a new Github page, showcasing the <a href="http://tumblr.github.com/#code">open source projects they've released</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Tumblr has also added a <a href="http://tumblr.github.com/#coming-soon">coming soon section,</a> highlighting open source projects they are planning on releasing in the near future.</p>
<p>What's interesting is they have also included <a href="http://tumblr.github.com/#presentations">select presentations from conferences and events Tumblr has presented at</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="http://tumblr.github.com/">Github implementation by Tumblr</a> is pretty unique, and to go even further, Tumblr has also&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/tumblr/tumblr.github.com">open sourced their whole approach to deploying it on Github</a>.</p>

<p>Tumblr's use of Github is worth showcasing. &nbsp;I think it's an innovative approach that other API owners could follow to showcase the open source project they are working on, as well as valuable event presentations.</p>
<p>I'm really impressed with the number of innovative uses of <a title="Github" href="https://github.com/">Github</a> I'm seeing lately.</p>

<p>When it comes to any business, you want to showcase your team, and the value they bring to the table. &nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the things I do here at <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, is showcase great examples of technology across the API industry. &nbsp;</p>
<p>With this in mind I wanted to showcase the <a title="Singly Team Page" href="https://singly.com/about">Singly team page.</a> &nbsp;When you visit singly.com and click on team in the footer, you get immediately see a team member photo carousel:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/singly/team/Singly-Team-Carousel.png" alt="" width="500" /></p>
<p>Which isn't very unique, but next you get 3 things that are unique:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Average number of hours each Singly team member slept this week</li>
<li>Number of Github commits in the last 7 days</li>
<li>Distance walked by Singly team members</li>
</ul>

<p>Singly team members provide this data using Quantified Self (QS) data from products like <a title="Fithbit" href="https://singly.com/docs/fitbit">Fitbit</a> and <a title="Runkeeper" href="https://singly.com/docs/runkeeper">Runkeeper</a>, and social programming networks like <a title="Github" href="https://singly.com/docs/github">Github</a>--driven by APIs. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Next Singly shows a map of their neighborhood in the San Francisco mission district:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/singly/team/Singly-Neighborhood.png" alt="" width="500" /></p>
<p>Then they wrap up with <a title="Instagram" href="https://singly.com/docs/instagram">Instagram</a> photos from team members:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/singly/team/Singly-Team-Instagram.png" alt="" width="500" /></p>
<p>The Singly team page is the best company team page I have ever seen. &nbsp;It shows extremely personal data from their Fitbit and Rukneeper devices, as well as the day to day business of code pushes via their Github accounts. The team page also shows you where the team is located and some Instagram photos to help you get the vibe of the team.</p>
<p>What does your website team page tell about your companies team?</p>

<p>When you spend a lot of time going to conferences, hackathons and events, you start really getting picky about which events you go to. To disrupt my regular routine, I need an event that will always add value to my professional career, but also be a good time!</p>
<p>When it comes to the latest in Internet technolgy, I always make time each year for the Gluecon and Defrag conferences. <a title="Gluecon" href="http://gluecon.com/2012/">Gluecon</a> is usually in the spring and <a title="Defrag" href="http://www.defragcon.com/2012/">Defrag</a> is in the fall--both occurring at the Omni Interlocken in Broomfield, CO.</p>
<p><a title="Defrag Confernece" href="http://www.defragcon.com/2012/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/defrag-2012/Defrag-2012-Conference.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.defragcon.com/2012/">Defrag is coming up November 15th and 16th</a>--right after November 1st and 2nd for the&nbsp;<a title="API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/index.php">API Strategy &amp; Practice in NYC.</a></p>
<p>API Strategy &amp; Conference is psyched to be partnering with Defrag in our first year.  If you <a title="Register for API strategy" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/register.php">register for API Strategy &amp; Conference</a>, you will get 10% off of your registration for Defrag.</p>
<p>The event combination will make November a great time to immerse yourself in the API industry, with API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference, then two weeks later, go further with Internet technology discussions at Defrag.</p>
<p>I look forward to seeing you at both <a title="API Strategy &amp; Practice" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/register.php">API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference</a> and <a title="Defrag" href="http://www.defragcon.com/2012/">Defrag</a> in November!&nbsp;</p>

        <p><a title="Github" href="http://www.github.com">Github</a> should be the center of your API operations, with the most obvious use being for SDK repositories, but Github offers a lot of other valuable tools that you can use to help manage your API platform.</p>
<p>One great use of Github is as an <a title="API issue management" href="/buildingblocks/ticket_system.php">API issue management</a> tool. &nbsp;The Github issue management system allows you to easily accept issue reports from your API community and apply labels to organize them into appropriate categories.</p>

<p>To setup Github Issue Management for your API, just create a new repository, but you won't actually being pushing any code, you will just be using it as a container for running issue management. &nbsp;Think of it as repository for your API itself.</p>
<p>Once setup, you can link the issue management page directly from your API area, allowing users to actively submit issues, comment and potentialy be part of the API product development cycle.</p>
<p>Along with API Issue Management with Github, you can link issues with the milestones portion of Github, providing deeper roadmap integration, but I will cover that in a separate post.</p>

<p>Back in May, when the <span>White House CIO has released a strategy, entitled "</span><a title="Digital Government: Building a 21st Century Platform to Better Serve the American People" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-government-strategy.pdf">Digital Government: Building a 21st Century Platform to Better Serve the American People</a><span>", which directs all federal agencies to publish HTML, JSON and XML versions of their digital strategy, I wrote a PHP script to monitor the progress.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>To date, 25 federal agencies have successfully published their digital strategy, and I have been updating my script regularly to keep up. And while a few of the agencies still have querks with their HTTP Codes and with JSON formatting, the code is starting to stabilize. &nbsp;So I decided to start <a title="Publishing to Github" href="https://github.com/kinlane/digital-strategy">sharing it on Github</a>, allowing others to put it to use.</p>
<p>The first sample script I'm publishing is a <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/digital-strategy/blob/master/pull-agency.php">basic example of how to pull the JSON version of a single agencies digital strategy</a>. &nbsp;Once it pulls the JSON, it then loops through each item and field on the strategy, and renders to screen. &nbsp;It doesn't make any assumptions on what you wish to do with data.</p>
<p>Next I will publish a more sophisticated version that stores values in a database. &nbsp;Here is the pull federal agency digital strategy PHP script:</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently processing several discussion I&rsquo;ve had with folks about APIs and the future of search when it comes to voice enabled apps, like <a title="Apples Siri" href="http://www.apple.com/ios/siri/">Apple&rsquo;s Siri.</a></p>
<p>It started with a discussion with the <a title="Webshell" href="http://webshell.io/home">Webshell</a> folks about their blog post, <a title="Webservices supply chain management : the SIRI case" href="http://api500.com/post/27440326130/webservices-supply-chain-management-the-siri-case">Webservices supply chain management : the SIRI case</a>.  Next I was reading a presentation from Pat Cappelaere(<a href="https://twitter.com/cappelaere">@cappelaere</a>) CEO of <a title="Vightel Corporation" href="http://projects.washingtonpost.com/top-secret-america/companies/vightel-corporation/">Vightel Corporation</a>. called <a title="Building Tomorrow&rsquo;s Web Services API" href="http://www.slideshare.net/cappelaere/building-tomorrows-web-services">Building Tomorrow&rsquo;s Web Services API</a>.</p>
<p>Pat has an interesting image in his deck, showing who the next generation consumer of your API will be:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/siri/Siri-API-Search.png" alt="" width="525" /></p>
<p>These conversations reflect a whole new area of consideration for the future of web APIs.  Will voice be the dominant way to search via our mobile devices?  If so, how do we expose our companies resources, in a way that makes them easily consumed by voice enabled apps?</p>
<p>At the simplest, we need to discuss where REST fails us in this scenario, and at the most complex we need to discuss what &ldquo;activities&rdquo; will be consumed by voice apps and what types of &ldquo;supply chain management&rdquo; processes or framework will we need to manage all of this.</p>
<p>All of this will feed into to whether or not your company, its products and services will be found in a Siri-like search, when voice enabled apps become the default.</p>

<p>You should track those two things, but those metrics alone do not define a successful API.  You should go much further.  Each API owner will have their own definition of success, thus their own set of metrics to measure success.</p>
<p>With this in mind, there is no single framework for measuring your API, but here is one suggestion for a basic framework to think about when tracking your API developers.</p>
<p>First establish some buckets to put users in:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>New</strong> - Brand new developer</li>
<li><strong>Active</strong> - Developer actively using API (come up with number)</li>
<li><strong>Inactive</strong> - Developers who go below the "active" number threshold for X number of days</li>
<li><strong>Billable</strong> - Developer who is paying you $$</li>
<li><strong>Partner</strong> - A developer who are working closer with than rest of developers</li>
<li><strong>Internal</strong> - Your staff or contractors who actively use your API, even for testing</li>
</ul>
<p>Then make sure and flag each user with a timestmap when they change status:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>5/2/2012 - New</li>
<li>5/2/2012 - Active</li>
<li>7/9/2012 - Billable</li>
<li>8/15/2012 - Inactive</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/charts-graphs-2.png" alt="" align="right" /></p>
<p>I like to generate daily, weekly and monthly counts for each bucket, plus see numbers on the churn between buckets.</p>
<p>Looking at developers in buckets, and tracking on their transitions between buckets allows you to start seeing the big picture, when large groups of users are migrating between status, or the individual picture, like why a single developer just went inactive.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see much to learn from just watching new registrations and number of API calls, but by creating meaningful buckets to place developers in, then understanding their evolution between these buckets, I think you can learn a lot with a pretty simple set of metrics.</p>

        <span class="post-date">18 Sep 2012</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.wordnik.com/" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/wordnik/wordnik-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>We all have our own approaches to API design and development, many of which will never see the light of day.  In the API space we hear a lot about API management and API success stories, but not much about the process of designing, developing and initial deployment of APIs.  I just had a little taste of how the <a href="http://www.wordnik.com/" target="_blank">Wordnik</a> team approaches it, using <a href="http://swagger.wordnik.com/" target="_blank">Swagger</a>.</p>
<p>Often when you hear about Swagger in the industry, you hear about the UI portion.  You know the sexy <a title="interactive documentation" href="http://apievangelist.com/buildingblocks/interactive_documentation.php">interactive documentation</a> that is fast becoming a standard with APIs, but it&rsquo;s just the tip of the iceberg--there is a whole lot more power to Swagger, than just interactive docs.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&ldquo;The heart of Swagger is the specification, and from that, cool shit can get done!&rdquo;,  say Tony Tam Wordnik CEO and technical co-founder.</em></p>
<p>To demonstrate, Tony walked me through Wordnik&rsquo;s approach to designing, developming and deploying a new API driven iPad app, using a team of 3:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>One person driving an editor writing JSON files, which are the Swagger spec for the needed API</li>
<li>The all three discussed the operations, parameters, while adding them to the JSON, and re-running the swagger spec validator after each meaningful change</li>
<li>When they were happy with the specs, they loaded the JSON files into the UI through  apache installed on a local machine</li>
<li>After they inspected each API and operation again, they wrote the models in the spec files, and reviewed again to make sure everything was good</li>
<li>Then they ran the Swagger Codegen and generated a Scalatra (Scala) server from the spec files</li>
<li>Then they ran the Swagger Codegen and generated an Objective-C client from the spec files</li>
<li>The server developer went off and wired the server to the business logic</li>
<li>The front-end guy went and wired the UI to the objective-c library</li>
</ul>
<p>The process took 2.5 hours in total, from API to interface--a technique they call interface-driven development, which focuses on modeling the perfect interface for the problem they are trying to solve using an API.</p>
<p><a href="http://swagger.wordnik.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/wordnik/Swagger-Logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>To solve this particular problem, they needed a scala server for the back-end.  they could have just as easily generated a Node.JS server, a Rails Sinatra server or any other based upon simple <a title="mustache templates" href="http://mustache.github.com/">mustache templates</a>. Additionally they could generate JavaScript, Scala, PHP or Python clients, but for this project they only needed Objective-C.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.wordnik.com/" target="_blank">Wordnik</a> approach to API design and development using <a href="http://swagger.wordnik.com/" target="_blank">Swagger</a> is interesting.  For me, it demonstrates that a clean API spec should not be an afterthought, and a means by which you generate interactive API documentation, or when API discovery becomes an issue.  Your entire design, development and management process should center around a meaningful API spec, which will then allow you to deploy your API server, interactive documentation, client code, while also providing API discovery.</p>

        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/youtube/Youtube-Stack-Overflow.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>YouTube has decided to <a href="http://apiblog.youtube.com/2012/09/the-youtube-api-on-stack-overflow.html">cease support for Youtube API QA via dedicated Google Group, and exclusively use Stack Overflow</a> for developer QA support.</p>
<p>Every developer knows that <a title="Stack Overflow" href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> is where you go to get the best answers for your programming issues, and API providers are taking notice too.</p>
<p>Stack Overflow has always been something I recommend paying attention to for any API evangelist, but more API providers are considering it be the place where all API developer QA should exist.</p>
<p><a title="Facebook" href="https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/545/">Facebook</a>, <a title="Foursquare" href="https://developer.foursquare.com/overview/support">Foursquare</a>, and <a title="Salesforce" href="http://blogs.developerforce.com/developer-relations/2012/08/now-in-public-beta-the-salesforce-stackexchange-qa-site.html">Salesforce</a> have all moved their API developer QA to Stack Overflow.</p>
<p>These API providers are still maintaining other API <a title="api support building blocks" href="/buildingblocks/">support building blocks</a> like <a title="bug ticket systems" href="/buildingblocks/ticket_system.php">bug ticket systems</a>, email and <a title="Twitter" href="/buildingblocks/twitter.php">Twitter</a> accounts, but when it comes to public developer forums they feel that Stack Overflow is enough.</p>
<p>While I think having a active presence on <a title="Stack Overflow" href="/buildingblocks/stack_exchange.php">Stack Overflow</a>&nbsp;is a critical part of any API evangelism strategy, I&rsquo;m not 100% sure eliminating a dedicated forum is the right way to go.  I worry you will push developer community completely out on the open Internet, reducing interactions that happen under your brand.</p>
<p>With the size of their developer community, larger APIs often have canyon that exists between them and their developers, and it&rsquo;s easy to widen this canyon by moving general QA exclusively into an open Internet forum.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that much more work to monitor and respond to your community forum as well as Stack Overflow, and even add in Quora, Reddit, StumbleUpon, Google Alerts, and other ways of monitoring the API and developer landscape.</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Sep 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/quantified-self/quantified-self.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m immersing myself into the fascinating new world of the <a title="Quantified Self" href="http://quantifiedself.com/about/">Quantified Self</a> (QS).  If you are not familiar with what QS is, according to Wikipedia:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Quantified Self is a movement to incorporate technology into data acquisition on aspects of a person's daily life in terms of inputs (e.g. food consumed, quality of surrounding air), states (e.g. mood, arousal, blood oxygen levels), and performance (mental and physical).</em></p>
<p>As I do with other areas, I start my research by doing a roundup of companies who offer QS products and services--which helps me define the space. Within an hour I easily found 50+ QS device manufacturers, some of which were complete with API driven integration platforms-- way too many to list in a single roundup, but here are a couple of better known companies:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="Fitbit" href="http://www.fitbit.com/">Fitbit</a></strong> - Fitbit is a health and fitness tracking device</li>
<li><strong><a title="Runkeeper" href="http://runkeeper.com/">RunKeeper</a></strong> - Runkeeper is a device for tracking<span>, measuring, and improving your fitness</span></li>
<li><strong><a title="Withings" href="http://www.withings.com/">Withings</a></strong> - Withings provides connected body scales, blood pressure and baby monitors</li>
<li><strong><a title="Zeo" href="http://www.myzeo.com/sleep/">Zeo</a></strong> - Zeo has sleep tracking and management devices and apps</li>
</ul>
<p>These QS platforms represent a whole new opportunity for the API industry, one that will drive the next generation of healthcare innovation.  Self-quantification starts with data collection, followed by visualization, then cross-referencing and the discovery of correlations--all three opportunites for APIs.</p>
<p>Devices can use APIs via cell and wifi to transmit data for collection and storage, while also allowing app developers to use the same APIs to help end-users manage and visualize their data. Then, when appropriate, use the same APIs providing access to other systems and providers who can then cross-reference and discover correlations within individual or groups of users.</p>
<p>It is exciting to think about the possibilities around QS.  New ways to gather data about our health and the environment around us in real-time, but also be able to understand this data in the most meaningful way possible, in a way that impacts the most important thing to us--our health!</p>
<p><strong>Devices + APIs + Cloud = Exciting Opportunities!</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m stoked to announce that <a title="Steve Klabnik" href="http://www.steveklabnik.com/">Steve Klabnik</a> will be speaking at the <a title="API Strategy &amp; Practice" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/speakers.php">API Strategy &amp; Practice conference</a>, November 1st &amp; 2nd in New York City.  I just added him to the homepage and <a title="API Speakers" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/speakers.php">speaker line-up</a>.</p>
<p>Steve is a highly respected Ruby developer, software craftsman, and an aspiring digital humanities scholar. He spends most of his time contributing to Open Source projects, and maintains both <a title="Hackety Hack" href="http://hackety.com/">Hackety Hack</a> and <a title="Shoes" href="http://shoesrb.com/">Shoes</a>, while also teaching and helping develop curriculum for&nbsp;<a title="JumpStart Labs" href="http://www.jumpstartlab.com/">Jumpstart Lab</a>.</p>
<p>Steve has has written book on <a title="Designing Hypermedia APIs" href="http://designinghypermediaapis.com/">Designing Hypermedia APIs</a>. Well it&rsquo;s better than a book.  I&rsquo;d call it a "living digital book". One where you can constantly come back and get fresh content and interact with the books community and author.  Much better than  the old-school programming book, which you buy once and it sits on your shelf.</p>
<p>What intrigues me about Steve, is that his perspective is very technical, but in his own words, &ldquo;<em>I've found a place between the sciences and the humanities.</em>&rdquo;  Which is a point of view we need to give a platform to, and everyone in Silicon Valley needs to listen.</p>
<p>Steve is exactly the fresh perspective we want to get at the <a title="API Strategy &amp; Practice" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/speakers.php">API Strategy &amp; Practice conference</a>.  I hope you can join us for the two day event in November and be there in person for Steve&rsquo;s talk.</p>

<p>Albert combines over 10 years of entrepreneurial experience with an in-depth technology background. As an entrepreneur, he has founded or co-founded five companies, including a management consulting firm (in Germany), a hosted data analytics company, a technology subsidiary for Telebanc (now E*Tradebank), an early stage investment firm, and most recently (with his wife), DailyLit, a service for reading books by email or RSS.</p>
<p>Albert also served as the president of del.icio.us through the company's sale to Yahoo. His technology background goes back to winning the German national computer science competition at age 18. Albert graduated summa cum laude from Harvard College in economics and computer science and holds a Ph.D. in Information Technology from MIT. He has managed technology projects for organizations as diverse as Tacoda (startup) and Telebanc (leading Internet bank).</p>
<p>USV invests in companies that have large networks of engaged users, differentiated by user experience and defensible by network effects, so USV has a vested interest in understanding developer communities, how APIs will evolve, what types of businesses are best suited to an API driven strategy.</p>
<p>The <a title="API Strategy &amp; Practice" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Practice &amp; Strategy conference</a> fireside chat with Albert Wenger will reflect the tone of the conference, which is a blend of both the technical and business of APIs--providing what is essential for companies to be successful with their API driven strategies.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m updating the login and authentication for my content management system, APIs and other tools to provide authentication using Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and Github by default. I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://singly.com/">Singly as an authentication provider</a>, because their aggregation of API authentication, endpoints and objects across these providers is easy and most efficient way I know to get this accomplished.</p>
<p>In addition to it being easy, I&rsquo;m using Singly for another advantage.  Each service Singly provides has a discovery endpoint, which provides me with metadata and the other endpoints each service provides.  I want to use this meta data to derive a quick snapshot ranking of my authenticating user.</p>
<p>For example, when a user authenticates via <a href="https://github.com/">Github Using Singly</a>, I get the following meta data and endpoints:</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/singly/Singly-Github-Meta-Endpoints.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>Singly gives me 6 endpoints with data from the user&rsquo;s activity in these areas.  I&rsquo;m looking to create an algorithm that will provide me with some quick ranking score based upon the number of repositories, followers and following a user has.</p>
<p>Right now I'm just going to add these up, take average across all my users that have logged in via Github.  I&rsquo;m sure I will evolve the design of the algorithm as I progress, but it should work for now.</p>
<p>My goal is to provide a little more insight into what type of user is signing up for my service, API or otherwise and possibly take different courses of action based upon their overall activity levels on Github.  I mean, if they are Github superstar I want to know it, and also know if they aren&rsquo;t very active at all.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll explore the same algorithm for <a href="https://www.singly.com/docs/twitter">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.singly.com/docs/facebook">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.singly.com/docs/linkedin">LinkedIn</a> authentication, but probably take different values into consideration for those social networks.</p>

<p>A sign of this growth can be seen by <a title="Sendgrid&rsquo;s announcement of their partnership with Zapier" href="http://sendgrid.com/blog/sync-data-between-applications/">Sendgrid&rsquo;s announcement of their partnership with Zapier</a>:</p>
<blockquote><em>Zapier makes it easy to sync data between web applications. They allow SaaS users to create integrations that push data between different web applications without having to waste time coming up with complicated systems.  Now you can easily connect to SendGrid along with hundreds of other apps without having to write a single line of code.</em></blockquote>

<p>API automation is allowing API providers to reach entirely new audiences, acting as a sort of icon-based interface allowing anyone put their APIs to work for them.</p>
<p>Up until now, if you wanted to integrate Sendgrid&rsquo;s email functionality into your workflow you would need to get a programmer, now any user can integrate email into their every day workflow--using the wide array of cloud services and APIs that <a title="automation platforms" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/08/21/api-automation-platforms/">automation platforms</a> are supporting.</p>
<p>Does your company have an API that users access via API Automation?</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/09/11/soa-cloud-2012-service-technology-symposium/">SOA Cloud 2012 Service Technology Symposium</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">11 Sep 2012</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/soa-cloud-2012-service-tech-symp/soa-cloud-2012-service-technology-symposium-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></p>
<p>I'm happy to be a media partner for the <a title="SOA Cloud 2012 Service Technology Symposium" href="http://www.servicetechsymposium.com/">SOA Cloud 2012 Service Technology Symposium</a>, the largest international conference dedicated to the exploration of SOA, cloud computing and modern service technologies.</p>
<p>SOA Cloud 2012 is happening September 24,25, 2012 in London, UK at the Imperial College London.  The first day kicks off with:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li> <strong><a title="The Era of Intelligent Service Technology" href="http://www.servicetechsymposium.com/agenda2012.php#keynote1">The Era of Intelligent Service Technology</a></strong> -  Thomas Erl's well-known, visionary tour of relationships between and combinations of service-oriented architecture, cloud computing, and semantic Web technologies. </li>
<li><a title="New Paradigms for Application Architecture" href="http://www.servicetechsymposium.com/agenda2012.php#keynote10">New Paradigms for Application Architecture</a>: From Applications to IT Services Speaker by Anne Thomas Manes of Gartner about the convergence of mobile, social, cloud, and information forcing demand that we adopt new paradigms for application architecture and delivery</li>
</ul>
<p>The first day keynotes have not one space agency talking APIs, but two.  With<a href="http://www.servicetechsymposium.com/agenda2012.php#keynote2"> Vicente Navarro of the European Space Agency</a>, and <a href="http://www.servicetechsymposium.com/agenda2012.php#keynote3">Hook Hua of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology</a> (NASA Center).</p>
<p>Second day keynotes are pretty impressive too, with opening keynote by Dennis Wisnosky, US Department of Defense &ndash; "<a href="http://www.servicetechsymposium.com/agenda2012.php#keynote6">Heading, Altitude &amp; Airspeed: Service Orientation, Cloud &amp; Semantics &ndash; All or Nothing!</a>".  Then Michael Hritz, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) &ndash; "<a href="http://www.servicetechsymposium.com/agenda2012.php#keynote7">SOA, Cloud and Service Technologies at the FAA</a>"  and "<a href="http://www.servicetechsymposium.com/agenda2012.php#keynote11">The API Economy is Here: Facebook, Twitter, Netflix and Your IT Enterprise</a>" from Corey Scobie of SOA Software looks interesting.</p>
<p>A couple sessions I&rsquo;m watching closely are:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://www.servicetechsymposium.com/agenda2012.php#the_open_api_economy">The Open API Economy: What Is It and How Do I Capitalize on It?</a> with Laura Olson of IBM</li>
<a href="http://www.servicetechsymposium.com/agenda2012.php#the_open_api_economy"> </a>
<li><a href="http://www.servicetechsymposium.com/agenda2012.php#the_open_api_economy"></a><a href="http://www.servicetechsymposium.com/agenda2012.php#the_rise_of_the_internet_service_bus">The Rise of the Internet Service Bus</a> with Jaime Ryan of Layer 7 Technologies </li>
<li><a href="http://www.servicetechsymposium.com/agenda2012.php#architecting_a_restful_cloud">Architecting a RESTful Cloud: The Key to Elasticity</a> with Jason Bloomberg of ZapThink</li>
</ul>
<p>Under the <a href="http://www.servicetechsymposium.com/panels2012.php">expert panels</a> the  The New World of Open APIs caught my eye, where they are discussing how the marketplace and economy that surround open APIs is rapidly growing, and has been further fueled by the acceptance of REST-based services and innovative hybrid solutions.</p>
<p>These are just a few of the keynotes, sessions and panel that caught my attention,  I&rsquo;m going to spend some time researching a couple of the speakers and companies and then I might have some more recommendations.  It looks like a lot of API goodness packed into 2 days, and would make a fun trip to London this month.</p>
