        <span class="post-date">13 Sep 2017</span>

<p>I am continuing my learning about Webhooks, and <a href="https://developer.github.com/webhooks/">Github keeps my notebook full with interesting building blocks we can use when crafting our own webhook strategies</a>. I’m not using everything I’m learning from Github in my current strategy, but I like adding each of these building blocks to my <a href="http://webhooks.apievangelist.com/">webhook research</a>, so that I can use in future guides that I publish. Today’s post overlaps two areas of my research into webhooks, and how headers are being used by a variety of API providers.</p>

<p>Github is using HTTP headers as part of the webhook response, providing the recipients of webhooks with more information about what is happening with each outgoing request. They are providing three custom headers along with each payload:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>X-GitHub-Event</strong> - Name of the event that triggered this delivery.</li>
  <li><strong>X-Hub-Signature</strong> - HMAC hex digest of the payload, using the hook’s secret as the key (if configured).</li>
  <li><strong>X-GitHub-Delivery</strong> - Unique ID for this delivery.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to these three custom headers, the User-Agent for the requests will have the prefix GitHub-Hookshot–so that your systems can identify these incoming requests more specifically. I like getting the name of the event, and definitely like the example of using the signature to make sure the payload hasn’t been tampered with, or from an untrustworthy source. Additionally you get a unique identifier for the delivery, allowing you to be able to record, and pull up unique webhook receipts.</p>

<p>I’m adding these all as building blocks to my webhook research. I still have a notebook full of other Github, Stripe, Twilio, and leading approaches to webhooks. Once I get through this round I’m going to apply what I’ve learned to the project I’m working on, and then see about pushing out the first draft of my webhooks guide–something I’ve never done before. If nothing else, I’m learning a lot. I’m learning from all the leaders in the space, who are several versions into their webhook designs. I’m finding the biggest challenge right now, is how I hold back and don’t do everything, keeping my webhook designs simple, intuitive, but as powerful as possible.</p>

<p>Every aspect of my business runs as either YAML or JSON. This blog post is YAML stored on Github, viewed as HTML using Jekyll. All the companies, services, tooling, building blocks, patents, and other components of my research all live as YAML on Github. Any API I design is born, and lives as an OpenAPI YAML document on Github. Sure, much of this will be imported, exported, and exported with a variety of other tools, but the YAML and JSON definition is key to every stop along the life cycle of my business, and the work that I do.</p>

<p>It isn’t just me. I’m seeing a big shift in how many platforms, services, and tooling operate, with often times YAML, and still in many situations it has JSON, XML, and CSV at its core. Everything you do should have some sort of schema definition, providing you with a template that you can reuse, share, collaborate, and communicate around. Platforms should allow for the creation of these template schema, and enable the exporting, and importing of them, opening up interoperability, and cross-platform functionality–much like APIs do in real-time using HTTP. This is what OpenAPI has done for the API lifecycle, and there should be many complementary, or even competing formats that accomplish the same, but for specific industries, and use cases.</p>

<p>You can see this in action over at AWS, <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/blogs/alexa/post/d362a0ab-61f3-4b17-9fb7-1ad12f39496e/export-your-amazon-lex-bot-schema-to-use-in-your-alexa-skill">with the ability to export your Lex bot schema for use in your Alexa skill</a>. Sure, this is interoperability on the same platform, but it does provide one example of how YAML and JSON definitions can help use share, reuse, and develop common templates for not just APIs, but also the clients, tooling, and other platforms we are engaging with. You’ll see this expand to every aspect of tech as continuous integration and deployment takes root, and Github continues it’s expansion beyond startups, into the enterprise, government, and other institutions. Along the way there will be a lot of no name schema finding success, but we will also need a lot more standardization and maturing as we’ve seen with OpenAPI, for all of this to work.</p>

<p>I hear a lot of grumbling from folks when it comes to YAML. I get it, I had the same feeling. It also reminds me of how I felt about JSON when it first emerged. However, I find YAML to be very liberating of brackets, slashes, and other delimiters, but I also find it is just one format, and I should always be supporting JSON, XML, and CSV when it comes to one dimensional schema. I don’t find it a challenge to convert between the formats, or keep some things one-dimensional to bridge to my spreadsheet oriented users. I actually feel it helps me think outside of my bubble. I enjoy rifling through the YAML and JSON templates I find on Github from a variety of operations, defining their bots, conversational interfaces, visualizations, CI/CD, configuration, clients, and other aspects of operations. Even if I’m never using them, I find it interesting to learn how others define what they are up to.</p>

        <span class="post-date">12 Sep 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/Mermade/awesome-openapi3"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/mike-ralphson/openapi_awesome1.png" align="right" width="35%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p>I’ve been setting aside time to browse through and explore tagged projects on Github each week, learning about what is new and trending out there on the Githubz. It is a great way to explore what is being built, and what is getting traction with users. You have to wade through a lot of useless stuff, but when I come across the gems it is always worth it. I’ve been providing guidance to all my customers that they should be publishing their projects to Github, as well as tagging them coherently, so that they come up as part of tagged searches via the Github website, and the API (I do a lot of discovery via the API).</p>

<p>When I am browsing API projects on Github I usually have a couple of orgs and users I tend to peek in on, and my friend Mike Ralphson (<a href="https://twitter.com/PermittedSoc">@PermittedSoc</a>) is always one. Except, I usually don’t have to remember to peek in on Mike’s work, because he is really good at tagging his work, and building interesting projects, so his stuff is usually coming up as I’m browsing tags. <a href="https://github.com/Mermade/awesome-openapi3">He is the first repository I’ve come across that is organizing OpenAPI 3.0 tooling</a>, and on his project he has some great advice for project owners: “Why not make your project discoverable by using the topic <a href="https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=topic%3Aopenapi3&amp;type=Repositories&amp;ref=advsearch&amp;l=&amp;l=">openapi3 on GitHub</a> and using the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23openapi3">#openapi3</a> on social media?” « Great advice Mike!!</p>

<p>As I said, I regularly monitor Github tags, and I also monitor a variety of hashtags on Twitter for API chatter. If you aren’t tagging your projects, and Tweeting them out with appropriate hashtags, the likelihood they are going to be found decreases pretty significantly. This is how Mike will find your OpenAPI 3.0 tooling for inclusion in his catalog, and it is how I will find your project for inclusion in stories via API Evangelist. It’s a pretty basic thing, but it is one that I know many of you are overlooking because you are down in the weeds working on your project, and even when you come up for air, you probably aren’t always thinking about self-promotion (you’re not a narcissist like me, or are you?)</p>

<p>Twitter #hashtags has long been a discovery mechanism on social media, but the tagging on Github is quickly picking up steam when it comes to coding project discovery. Also, with the myriad of ways in which Github repos are being used beyond code, Github tagging makes it a discovery tool in general. When you consider how API providers are publishing their API portals, documentation, SDKs, definitions, schema, guides, and much more, it makes Github one of the most important API discovery tools out there, moving well beyond what ProgrammableWeb or Google brings to the table. I’ll continue to turn up the volume on what is possible with Github, as it is no secret that I’m a fan. Everything I do runs on Github, from my website, to my APIs, and supporting tooling–making it a pretty critical part of what I do in the API sector.</p>

        <span class="post-date">12 Sep 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md#componentsObject"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/openapi/openapi-30-components-object.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p>There were a number of changes made to the structure of Open API in the move to version 3.0 that I am a fan of, but if I had to point at a single seismic shift that I think will move the conversation forward it is <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md#componentsObject">the components object</a>. According to the specification the components object, “holds a set of reusable objects for different aspects of the OAS. All objects defined within the components object will have no effect on the API unless they are explicitly referenced from properties outside the components object.” It is the store for for all the common and reusable aspects of defining, and designing your APIs–which will have huge benefits on how we are doing all of this.</p>

<p>Here is the laundry list of what you can put into your OpenAPI 3.0 components object, and reference throughout your API definitions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>schemas</strong> - An object to hold reusable data schema used across your definitions.</li>
  <li><strong>responses</strong> - An object to hold reusable responses, status codes, and their references.</li>
  <li><strong>parameters</strong> - An object to hold reusable parameters you are using throughout your API requests.</li>
  <li><strong>examples</strong> - An object to hold reusable the examples of requests and responses used in your design.</li>
  <li><strong>requestBodies</strong> - An object to hold reusable the bodies that will be sent with your API request.</li>
  <li><strong>headers</strong> - An object to hold reusable headers that define the HTTP structure of your requests.</li>
  <li><strong>securitySchemes</strong> - An object to hold reusable security definitions that protect your API resources.</li>
  <li><strong>links</strong> - An object to hold reusable links that get applied to API requests, moving it towards hypermedia.</li>
  <li><strong>callbacks</strong> - An object to hold reusable callbacks that can be applied.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/07/31/you-see-duplicate-work-while-i-see-common-patterns/">I’ve written about how many API developers see this stuff as duplicate work across our APIs</a>, where I see them as common, resusable patterns that we should be getting organized–the OpenAPI 3.0 components object is the beginning of us getting this house in order. The components object is how API architects and designers can ensure that API developers are being consistent in their work, and not just reusing common elements, but reusing well thought out, fully baked elements that adhere to standards and common definitions used throughout the industry.</p>

<p>The OpenAPI 3.0 components object is where we are going to start injecting API literacy training into the development process. It is where we will teach developers about headers, and common ways of securing our APIs. It is where we will start reusing common dictinaries like Schema.org so we STOP re-inventing the wheel when it comes to defining our schema definitions, fields, and other mundane aspects of crafting an API. The components object isn’t just where we are reusing components within a single OpenAPI, it is where we will start reusing across all the OpenAPIs we are crafting, and learning, sharing, collaborating, and reusing across OpenAPIs that are made publicly available.</p>

<p>The OpenAPI 3.0 components object is where we are going to start delivering the hypermedia literacy that was required to get the adopttion that hypermedia advocates envision, but were stonewalled because people just didn’t get it. I’m pretty excited about this aspect of OpenAPI 3.0, and I got myself so fired up about it last night I started building some of my API dictionary tooling I’ve had in my head for a while, but didn’t have just the right vehicle in mind for delivering at scale. I haven’t had much time for playing with OpenAPI 3.0, or the tooling that has emerged, but I got the bug now. I’m going to prioritize some work in this area, if nothing else for generating some relevant stories here on the blog, and keeping me in tune with folks are doing. Oh, that reminds me, have you seen what my friend Mike Ralphson (<a href="https://twitter.com/PermittedSoc">@PermittedSoc</a>) is up to? <a href="https://github.com/Mermade/">He is leading the charge when it comes to OpenAPI 3.0 tooling</a> « I recommend keeping an eye on what he is up to on Github.</p>

        <span class="post-date">12 Sep 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/usps/office-of-inspector-general-united-states-postal-service-api-audit-report.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.uspsoig.gov/sites/default/files/document-library-files/2017/IT-AR-17-006.pdf">The Office Of Inspector General for US Postal Service published an audit report on the federal agencies API strategy</a>, which has opened their eyes to the potential of API management, and the direct value it can bring to their customers, and their business. The USPS has some extremely high value APIs that are baked into ecommerce solutions around the country, and have even launched an API management solution recently, but until now have not been actively analyzing and using API usage to guide them in any of their business planning decisions.</p>

<p>According to the report, “The Postal Service captures customer API usage data and distributes it to stakeholders outside of the Web Tools team via spreadsheets every month. However, management is not using that data to plan for future API needs. This occurred because management did not agree on which group was responsible for reviewing and making decisions about captured usage data.” I’m sure this is common in other agencies, as APIs are often evolved within IT groups, that can have significant canyons between them and any business units. Data isn’t shared, unless a project specifically designates it to be shared, or leadership directs it, leaving real-time API management data out of reach of those business groups making decisions.</p>

<p>It is good to see another federal agency wake up to the potential of API management, and the awareness it can bring to business groups. It’s not just some technical implementation with logfiles, it is actual business intelligence that can be used to guide the agency forward, and help an agency better serve constituents (customers). The awareness introduced by doing APIs, and then properly managing APIs, analyzing usage, and building and understanding what is happening, is a journey. It’s a journey that not all federal agencies have even begun (sadly). It is important that other agencies follow USPS lead, because it is likely you are already gathering valuable data, and just passing it on to external partners like USPS has been doing, not capturing any of the value for yourself. Compounding the budget, and other business challenges you are already facing, when you could be using this data to make better informed decisions, or even more important, establishing new revenue streams from your valuable public sector resources.</p>

<p>While it may seem far fetched at the moment, but <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/05/05/taxation-on-public-data-via-the-api-management-layer/">this API management layer reflects the future of government revenue and tax base</a>. This is how companies in the private sector are generating revenue, and if commercial partners are building solutions on top of public sector data and other digital resources, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/08/24/setting-a-precedent-when-charging-for-high-volume-access-to-government-apis/">these government agencies should be able to generate new revenue streams from these partnerships</a>. This is how government works with physical public resources, there should be no difference when it comes to digital public resources. We just haven’t reached the realization that this is the future of how we make sure government is funded, and has the resources it needs to not just compete in the digital world, but actually innovate as many of us hope it will. It will take many years for federal agencies to get to this point. This is why they need to get started on their API journey, and begin managing their data assets in an organized way as the USPS is beginning to do.</p>

<p>API management has been around for a decade. It isn’t some new concept, and their are plenty of open source solutions available for federal agencies to put to use. All the major cloud platforms have it baked into their operations, making it a commodity, alongside compute, storage, DNS, and the other building blocks of our digital worlds. I’ll be looking for other ways to influence government leadership to light the API fire within federal agencies like the Office of the Inspector General has done at the U.S. Postal Service. It is important that agencies be developing awareness, and making business decisions from the APIs they offer, just like they are doing from their web properties. Something that will set the stage for future for how the government serves its constituents, customers, and generates the revenue it needs to keep operating, and even possibly leading in the digital evolution of the public sector.</p>

<p>I’m just coming out of a sprint for <a href="http://org.open.referral.adopta.agency/">my Human Services Data API (HSDA) work</a>. Throughout the process of gathering feedback across emails, Slack Channels, and Github Issues, and trying to decide where I should be steering this ship, I’m regularly reminded that I’m often preparing for a future that may never come. I’m working real hard to make my API design as future proof as possible, but I find that in many cases I risk leaving folks behind with some of my API design decisions. When it comes to the audience for this API, municipalities and nonprofit organizations, this concern was present with every decision I have been making.</p>

<p>As part of this latest evolution, I took hypermedia and GraphQL off the table, as both areas seem to confuse and muddy the conversation, not help. I was hoping that GraphQL might help some of the requests around query-ability of APIs, and the tendency to load up individual paths with numerous parameters, and enums. I tried to facilitate discussions around unique identifiers, moving things beyond just incremental integers, taking a cue from Twitter and other large providers, but many just deemed these conversation overkill, unnecessary, and bothersome. While I have learned a lot over the last seven years as the API Evangelist, I am regularly reminded that not everyone has been along for the ride, and I need to always bring things back to ground level, even if it means making some cringe-worthy API design choices.</p>

<p>I find as a technologist, I suffer from hopeless futurism. Even though I know better, I still tend to prefer looking at what is next, preparing as much as I can for the future, even at the expense of where we’ve been, and possibly leaving people behind. I can argue until I’m blue in the face regarding the benefits of hypermedia when it comes to supporting clients, and the benefits of GraphQL when it comes to giving API consumers a stronger voice when it comes to querying and getting access to EXACTLY the data they need, but without the proper groundwork, and education, my audience is rarely going to care. APIs are a journey, and I feel like APIs have to take their course, and folks have to be along for the ride. There is just no hurrying this process, no matter how much knowledge about the future I may possess, or how passionate and aggressive I am about why a particular API design decision will matter down the road.</p>

<p>I am working very hard to tame my tech bro futurism fetish, and better understand what the humans here on the ground in the present will need. I’m also working a lot harder to try and figure out how I can incorporate API lessons into my API design and definition work. How can I teach folks about headers, with specific design decisions I’ve made? How can I teach folks about how the client will break with a certain API design approach? As a technologist it is very hard to allow myself the space to make sub-standard API design decisions for the sake of helping an audience learn along the way. I want everything to be right, dammit! However, I’d much rather that my APIs actually get used, and the folks I’m targeting with my designs aren’t turned off by what I’ve delivered because they don’t see the value, or relevance. I’m working hard to not always be a tech boy scout, and always being prepared for a future that may not come.</p>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong> I am guessing that all the folks who keep saying I’m so anti-GraphQL will not recognize how much I’m incorporating it into my work, and storytelling, and that this is a POSITIVE story about how GraphQL might have helped. It also still highlighting my argument(s) around investment in API education, and not being aggressive when you are pushing GraphQL, as I’ve learned first hand and keep trying to share in my (aggressive) GraphQL posts.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/08/31/your-lack-of-investment-in-api-education-will-be-the-end-of-your-api-service/">I wrote about this in a mean way during my rant week</a>, but I wanted to bring up the topic of education and training when it comes to APIs in a more constructive way this week. Amidst the regular requests I get for API architects, developers, product managers, and evangelists I am reminding many companies that they will often need to hire for these roles internally, training and grooming existing employees, as finding seasoned veterans in any of these areas will prove to be difficult. I wish I had my own API school, where I was helping train waves of qualified employees, but sadly most of the folks with existing skills are employed.</p>

<p>The challenge of investing in API training and education doesn’t stop with your immediate team, this is something that needs to occur in most cases company-wide. I’ve talk with several groups about developing internal workshops, and training, but I find most of them aren’t truly interested in the investment needed, and are often looking for some free content, or someone they can get to come and speak for free or very low pay. It shows me that many companies aren’t quite ready to make the investment it will take to ensure their staff are ready for the work that lies ahead, and don’t value making sure their workers have the skills they’ll need to be successful in the API-driven world we are finding ourselves in.</p>

<p>This isn’t something I’ve just encountered at SMB, SME, and the enterprise. Government agencies are always cashed strapped, under-resourced, and lacking in the skills needed for the next wave. This is also a problem I’m seeing across startups. I’ve had discussions with startup groups selling tools and services to the API space, who are hitting significant challenges once they start selling their solutions outside the mainstream tech ecosystem. Many folks at large companies, small businesses, and government agencies just don’t have some of the basics when it comes the web, and how modern approaches to APIs work. To become an active customer, they are going to need some investment to get their customers up to speed, something I find the investors behind startups are rarely keen on spending money on.</p>

<p>I am working on a workshop series for a health care group in October, and I’m working real hard to develop some structure to help make sure I cover the fundamentals of why APIs are important, beginning with the web and HTTP. I’m trying to show the space from not just the API provider perspective, but also from the API consumer view, because everyone should be both. I’m also working on more stories to help educate why companies, investors, institutions, and government agencies should be investing more into the area of API education. Not just understanding how to provide and consume them, but how to secure them, understand that they are driving everything mobile, and can help securely open up their operations to allow for assistant by 3rd party providers. Humans will be the number one challenge you face when it comes to doing APIs in your organization, so make sure you are investing wisely. I’d love to hear more about the challenges you are facing, or how you are finding success when it comes to educating your staff or customers about everything API.</p>

        <span class="post-date">11 Sep 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/open-referral/hsda-schema.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15p;" /></p>
<p>I’m working on v1.2 of <a href="http://org.open.referral.adopta.agency/">my Human Sevices Data API (HSDA)</a>, and with this wave of work I’m making sue there is a functional API for validating all JSON that gets posted as the body in requests, as well as when it gets returned as part of API responses. To drive my validator I’m using JSON schema, which I already have defined as part of <a href="https://github.com/human-services/portal/tree/master/_data/api-commons">the OpenAPI definition for the project</a>. I want to reuse, and build on top of this work, but I found the definitions for my OpenAPI to be pretty deficient in much of the details I am needing to validate the request and response bodies of my HSDA APIs.</p>

<p>The process has showed me the importance of making sure the definitions portion of my OpenAPIs are as robust as I can. Possessing required, default, regex patterns, and other details I’m going to need to make sure my schema validator is as robust as possible. I’m entering the phase of this project where vendors, and implementors are looking for guidance on whether or not their schema are HSDS/A compliant, and they are supporting the fields necessary to get a stamp of approval. The schema validator is essential to this, but the new validation API I’ve created is only as good as the JSON schema that I’m using as part of its engine.</p>

<p>I come across a number of OpenAPIs in the wild which do not possess schema definitions, and references for each API. These API providers are only describing enough of the surface area of their API to be able to generate API documentation using Swagger UI. This is something I’ve also been guilty of in the past, where I would only define the surface area of the API, just to get what I needed for my API discovery needs. Over the last year, I’ve spent more time making sure the definitions portion of the OpenAPI is also present, but it isn’t until now that I’ve been making sure the fine details of the schema are present. I need this to be in place for validation, which will be used across monitoring, testing, and other stops along the API life cycle I will be delivering as part of this work.</p>

<p>Honestly, my JSON schema chops were not up to snuff for this work, something I’ve struggled with making the time for this summer. However, I feel like I’m finally getting there. I’m beyond the basics of JSON schema validation, and have my simple API validator API in place. I just need to make sure I’m always investing the time required to develop robust JSON schema for all my APIs, so that the validator provides rich responses with each API schema validation. I’m thinking I will be build a tool for helping identify what is lacking with the definitions in my OpenAPIs, pointing out the common things I’m lacking, and running this before I ever consider actually validating the schema that are used in the API request body, or the API response body for the projects I’m working on. Always making sure the schema, and API definitions are harmonized, and speaking the same language is essential to all of this human services API effort to work properly.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/09/11/version-1-2-of-human-services-data-api/">Version 1.2 Draft Of The Human Services Data API</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">11 Sep 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/open-referral/hsda-v1-2.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15p;" /></p>
<p>I have been working on the next version of the Human Services Data API (HSDA) OpenAPI lately, taking all the comments from the Github repository, and pushing forward the specification as far as I can with the minor v1.2 release. <a href="https://github.com/openreferral/api-specification/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Av1.2">I have the Github issues organized by v1.2</a>, and have invested time moving forward the OpenAPI for the project, as well as my demo site for the effort.</p>

<p>With this release I am focusing on six main areas, based upon feedback from the group, and what makes sense to move forward without any non-breaking changes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/openreferral/api-specification/issues/45">/complete</a> - add an /everything to each core resource, allowing access to all sub resouces.</li>
  <li><a href="query">query</a> - Shifting query parameter to be array, allowing for multiple fields to be queried.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/openreferral/api-specification/issues/39">content negotiation</a> - Allow for JSON, XML, and responses.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/openreferral/api-specification/issues/12">sorting</a> - Adding sorting.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/openreferral/api-specification/issues/10">pagination</a> - Adding pagination.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/openreferral/api-specification/issues/48">status codes</a> - Add more status codes.</li>
</ul>

<p>These were main concerns regarding what was missing from the last release, and were the top items that made sense to push forward this round. I’ve made some other major shifts to the project, but before I go through those, I wanted to provide some more insight into these v1.2 changes to the core HSDA specification. Helping shed some light on why I did what I did, while I am looking to make the API interface as usable as possible for HSDA implementations, vendors servicing the space, as well as developers looking to build web, mobile, voice, and other applications on top of any APIs that support the implementation.</p>

<p><strong>Complete</strong>
Getting access to the entire surface area of the core resources (organizations, locations, and services), as well as all the subresources (phones, physical address, mailing address, etc.) was the most voiced request from v1.1. I had laid out several options to access the entire surface are of HSDA resources, but folks seem focused on a single set of API paths to accomplish what they needed from a vendor and implementation perspective. It is my job to keep the API serving all types of integrations and use cases, but definitely couldn’t ignore providing a single set of paths for GET, POST, and PUT of organizations, locations, and services.</p>

<p>It was important to me to keep the core resources accessible as a flat, one dimensional, and machine readable documentation, so API consumers could quickly import into spreadsheets as CSV, or make lists of addresses, or possible lookups and updates to a single phone number. I didn’t want to abandon these use cases, or introduce breaking changes, so I introduced a /complete path for all three of the core sources (organizations, locations, and services. These paths allow for GET, POST, and PUT requests of multi-dimensional JSON objects, access the core, as well as sub-resources for any data stored within the API. These paths should accommodate the heavy system to system vendor and implementation usage that was voiced as part of the feedback process, while still preserving other individual use cases.</p>

<p><strong>Query</strong>
With v1.1 the query parameter for making API requests on organizations, locations, and services was simply a string, which you could provide a set of strings for. At the request of the community we’ve made this an array, allowing you to specify multiple fields and values as part of your query. To ensure I didn’t introduce a breaking change, I did not alter the existing query parameter, instead I added a new parameter called queries, which allows you to get more detailed with your queries. Now there is a simple search, and more robust multi-field search, giving more control to API consumers. In the future we will explore more query power, but this might reside in the search API portion of this conversation which we’ll address later.</p>

<p><strong>Content Negotiation</strong>
The Human Services Data Specification (HSDS) is a CSV format. While HSDA has focused on using JSON as part of all API requests and responses, I made sure that v1.1 stayed true to the original HSDS format, making the entire surface area accessible via simple API paths, and returning one dimensional responses that can still be returned as CSV. So with v1.2 I allowed for the negotiation of either CSV, XML, or JSON content types for all the primary HSDA paths. The /complete paths do not support CSV, as they provide access to resources, and sub-resources that cannot be returned as CSV, but the rest of the surface allows API consumers to negotiate the format they desire.</p>

<p>Keeping the surface area of the entire HSDS format accessible via simple API paths, without authentication, and providing the option of returning data in CSV, opens up the API to be used to export to Excel and Google docs in a single step. This will open up the ability to extract core resources like organizations, locations, services, as well as sub-resources such as phone and address lists into CSV format, which can then easily be used by a much wider audience than just developers, and other common API consumers.</p>

<p><strong>Sorting</strong>
There was no ability to sort any data within an HSDA responses with previous version. With version 1.2 you can now provide a sort_by parameter which determines the field to sort by, and order, which determines whether to sort by ascending (asc), or descending (desc) order. I had in there to add the ability to sort by what has been changed recently, but I have run out of time, and will make sure it gets into future releases. It was important that we at least get basic sorting features in there for this release, and can add more aspects to this dimension in the near future.</p>

<p><strong>Pagination</strong>
In previous versions of HSDA you could pass in a parameter to specify which page to return, and per_page to determine how many results to return per page. However, there was no data return telling you which page you were on, the count per page, or anything else about what is next or previous as part of each results. Several solutions to this were presented as part of the feedback process for v1.0 and v1.1, but not much feedback was given on the subject. Again, I was looking to introduce this feature without any breaking changes. With the flat, one dimensional array structure of the HSDA response structure it would be difficult to add in any envelope, or collection for returning pagination data, so I set out to find examples of how it can be done without disrupting the current response structure.</p>

<p>After looking at Github an a handful of other approaches I opted to add a customer header called x-pagination which provides a JSON object containing total_pages, first_page, last_page, previous_page, and next_page to each GET response, allowing consumers to easily navigation the pagination for large API responses. This approach does not introduce any breaking changes, while still providing all the data needed by API consumers to navigate the surface area of any HSDA implementation, across organizations, locations, and services. I do have some concerns about developers being HTTP header aware, and know how to access headers, but it is something that with a little bit of education, can open a whole new world to them–something any API developer should have in their toolbox.</p>

<p><strong>Status Codes</strong>
One area that HSDA v1.0 and 1.1 were deficient in was when it came to HTTP status code guidance. I had this slated for v1.3, but I was needing to know when I hit an error in some of the validation, documentation, and other tooling  had been working on. So I took this opportunity to add 403, and 500 HTTP status codes to all API responses. All the GET paths are publicly available, but with this edition I’ve introduced an API management service, allowing me to secure all POST, PUT, and DELETE paths, opening them up to multiple users in a secure way. I didn’t want all other users to simply get a 404, so I added 403 guidance. I will be adding more specific HTTP status code guidance, and error response schema in future versions.</p>

<p><strong>Additional Services</strong>
That was the majority of features involved with the v1.2 release. However there were other aspects of HSDA that were left out of v1.1, like meta, search, and taxonomy. Also, as part of the v1.1 feedback process there were other features thrown out that were needed as part of future releases. All of this had the potential to add unnecessary complexity to the core set of resources, making the specification bloated, making things even more complex than it already is. To help alleviate these challenges I’ve started breaking future APIs into separate projects, or services. Here are the additional seven services I’ve added:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>HSDA Search</strong> - A service dedicated to search across HSDA implementations.</li>
  <li><strong>HSDA Bulk</strong> - A service dedicated to managing bulk operations across HSDA implementations.</li>
  <li><strong>HSDA Taxonomy</strong> - A service dedicated to working with taxonomy across HSDA implementations.</li>
  <li><strong>HSDA Orchestration</strong> - A service dedicated to handling orchestration, evented infrastructure, and webhooks across HSDA implementations.</li>
  <li><strong>HSDA Meta</strong> - A service dedicated to handling meta data and logging across HSDA implementations.</li>
  <li><strong>HSDA Management</strong> - A service dedicated to introducing an API management across HSDA implementations.</li>
  <li><strong>HSDA Utility</strong> - A service dedicated to housing all utility APIs across HSDA implementations.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these services are meant to augment and complement the core set of HSDA resources, and sub-resources without adding unnecessary complexity to them. These projects are meant to act as a buffet of services that human service providers can choose from, or they can opt to just stick with the basic. I’ve reset the version for each of these projects to v1.0, and will be moving them forward at their own pace, independent of what the core HSDA specification is doing. I’ve introduced separate OpenAPI definitions for each project, and I am pushing forward independent code repositories for delivering PHP/MySQL implementations for each service area. Like the other features for HSDA v1.2 above, I wanted to take a moment and explain the logic behind each of these services.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/open-referral/hsda-organizations-swagger-ui.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15p;" /></p>
<p><strong>HSDA Search</strong>
Early on in the release of v1.1 the question of search quickly began to muddy the conversation. I saw this was going to be a challenge. I saw the communities desire to deliver features via query parameters, and knew that search was going to introduce a number of parameters beyond what was needed to just manage core resources (organizations, locations, and services). We also started getting some great feedback from vendors in the Github issues for search features that went well beyond what was needed for individual resources, and often spanned all the core resources. Search had been a separate path in the core HSDA specification, and with this version I decided to break it off the core specification and put it into it’s own project, where it can become a first class citizen.</p>

<p>The current HSDA search v1.0 specification got all query, queries, sorting, and pagination that the core HSDA resource received in the v1.2 release, but once they were added it got broken off into it’s own service. Technically this is a breaking change, but I think it is one the community will support, as it will add some valuable search features. Immediately, I added a set of collections that spanned all core resources, including organizations, locations, and services, and I took the /complete features I had just added to HSDA and introduced them to HSDA search. This makes all the search results as rich, and complete as possible, providing access to the entire surface area. I feel like ultimately this is where we will be experimenting with allowing consumers to restrict, or expand the results they are looking to get back, while keeping core resources cachable, available at known paths.</p>

<p><strong>HSDA Bulk</strong>
One of the conversations that led to the introduction of /complete paths for all core resources in v1.2 was the needs of vendors, and the heavy lifting requirements of individual implementations. There was the need to load large volumes of data into systems, as well as between disparate systems. There was talk about the load this causes of systems that drive critical websites and other infrastructure, resulting it being something done during off-peak hours. Some of this work can be done via the primary HSDA /complete service, but it was clear that a separate bulk set of API would be needed to help handle the load, and meet the unique needs of system integrators, that were different than what web, mobile, voice, and other applications developers would be building.</p>

<p>HSDA Bulk reflects the HSDA /complete paths for organizations, locations, and services, but these paths accept the posting of arrays of objects, complete with all their sub-object. Instead of directly loading these into the main database upon POSTing, they are entered individually into a jobs database, where they can be queried, and run independently on a schedule, or based upon specific events. HSDA bulk will work in conjunction with HSDA, HSDA Meta, HSDA Management, and HSDA orchestration, or it can be run independently, based upon custom criteria. The goal is to provide a way to handle the bulk needs of HSDA implementations which can be deployed, scaled, and operated independently of any core HSDA implementation, limiting the impact on core websites, mobile applications, and other applications.</p>

<p><strong>HSDA Taxonomy</strong>
The taxonomy portion of HSDA got separated as part of the v1.1 release. I quickly saw it needed more thinking regarding the handling of multiple taxonomies, as well as allowing for the accessing of services beyond core HSDA resource management, or even search. HSDA Taxonomy is now it’s own project, and can be deployed independently of any HSDA implementation, but provide another doorway for querying, browsing and getting at services based upon any supported taxonomy. The v1.0 version of HSDA Taxonomy will support AIRS and Open Eligibility, but will be designed to support any other taxonomy, and allow for customization by individual implementations, while maintaining a common API for usage across multiple HSDA implementations.</p>

<p><strong>HSDA Orchestration</strong>
Throughout HSDA v1.1 discussion I kept hearing about the need for notifying users of changes to HSDA data, and the need to push and ping external systems with information. As part of the build up to v1.2 I conducted a significant amount of research into the event and webhook implementations of leading API providers like Box, Twilio, Stripe, and others. I’ve taken this research and created a v1.0 draft for an HSDA Orchestration solution. Working to alleviate a wide variety of needs for handling events that occur across HSDA implementations, engaging with external implementations, and making HSDA a two-way street.</p>

<p>HSDA Orchestration will potentially work with HSDA Meta, HSDA Bulk, HSDA Management, and of course, HSDA core to bring implementations alive. A number of events will be defined around common HSDA task that occur like POSTing of new organizations, or locations, or updating of individual records, or possibly the submission of bulk updates that need running. Every API call within an HSDA implementation can now be tracked using HSDA Meta, and HSDA Orchestration will monitor this, and allow API consumers to subscribe to these events via webhooks, and receive a ping when event occurs, or receive a fat ping, which pushes data associated with an event to an external URL. HSDA orchestration will handle all the monitoring, tracking, notification, and syncing needed between HSDA implementations via a separate, independent service that works with the HSDA stack.</p>

<p><strong>HSDA Meta</strong>
HSDA Meta is another feature that got set aside with the v1.1 release. With v1.2 I’ve set it up as it’s own project. Now each API call made to any core HSDA path will be added to the HSDA Meta system, recording the service, path, verb, parameters, and body of each request. HSDA Meta is designed to providing a logging solution, eventually a transactional layer that can be rolled forward or backwards, and is intended as stated before to work with HSDA Bulk, HSDA Orchestration, and leveraging HSDA Management for access, and auditability of all activity.</p>

<p><strong>HSDA Management</strong>
HSDA is in need of an API management layer. Many of the paths available allow for reading, writing, and deleting of data. The original HSDA v1.0 and v1.1 only allowed for a single administrative key for accessing all POST, PUT, and DELETE API paths. With the v1.2 release I’ve begun this separate project for allowing the adding, authenticating, and managing of API users who are looking to get at HSDA data. The current implementation allows for many users, and each users to have access to one, or many of the services, and supporting API paths. It is up to each implementation to decide which users get access to which. In future releases we will add the notion of access plans, allowing for trusted groups to be established, including partners, and internal consumers. The goal with this is to identify a common interface for HSDA implementations, which behind the scenes could be any number of existing API management implementations.</p>

<p><strong>HSDA Utility</strong>
Last, I needed a place to put any utility APIs I needed to help manage HSDA implementations. Right now there are two core set of APIs. One for managing which services are available across and HSDA implementation, and another for validating HSDA schema, and eventually the APIs themselves. I will be putting any other utility API within this service area. It will become the catch-all for any API that doesn’t fit into it’s service area.</p>

<p><strong>HSDA Specification</strong>
That is it. That is the bulk of the work I’ve done for the v1.2 release of HSDA. I’m pretty happy with how things have worked out. I feel there is a lot more coherency across the specification now, and the service mindset will allow for much more constructive conversations across the projects. <a href="https://openreferral.github.io/api-specification/hsda/">I have updated the HSDA specification site with all eight of the OpenAPIs, publishing a separate documentation page for each one.</a> Each page provides an HTML view for each service, as well as link to the YAML version of the OpenAPI, the demo website, as well as Github Issues for each project. Next step is to drive the feedback and comments via the Github issues, include anything that is missing, and push v1.2 out the door, and begin working on v1.3, as well as the v1.1 for the seven other projects that were added with this release.</p>

<p><strong>HSDA Implementation</strong>
I do not ever feel an OpenAPI is ready for prime time until I have a working version of it. <a href="http://developer.open.referral.adopta.agency/">I have created working versions of all eight HSDA implementations.</a> The core HSDA is the most complete and robust, with HSDA Search, HSDA Bulk, HSDA Meta, HSDA Management, HSDA Utility, HSDA Taxonomy, and HSDA Orchestration following up in that order. They are v1.0 draft implementations, and for the most part are working, but have not been hardened yet. I would feel comfortable putting HSDA, and HSDA Management, and HSDA Meta into a real world implementation in coming weeks, something I will actually be doing with two separate implementations–using real world projects to harden them.</p>

<p>I have updated the HSDA demo portal to contain all eight projects, and I have leveraged Github authentication as the HSDA Management layer, allowing anyone to signup and use their Github account to access with each API. Each API call is logged, and I can easily revoke access to any account, or push reset on the demo as needed. Now that I have a working copy, I will be publishing a development version of the portal, so that I do not break the demo in the future, and can move forward with releases a little more gracefully than I did with this one. I will be maturing all eight implementations, and offering them up as official Adopta.Agency products for deployment on AWS in the near future.</p>

<p><strong>Looking To The Future</strong>
This release of HSDA and the supporting code is all about looking towards the future. I’ve separated things out into independent services to handle what is next, and I’ve re-engineered my PHP/MySQL implementations to prepare for the future. Each of the eight solutions are 100% OpenAPI driven. The database and server side code is all OpenAPI driven. The portal, documentation, and the schema validation is all OpenAPI driven. Next, I’m setting up monitoring, and testing, that will all be OpenAPI driven.</p>

<p>I also have two other services I did not include in this story because they are meant for the future. One is HSDA Custom, which allows for the addition of any field, or collection to the core HSDA implementation, accommodating the needs of individual providers. This is only possible because of OpenAPI, and each custom field will be added as x-[field], keeping things validating. The second one I’m calling HSDA Aggregation, which will be my first attempt to sync, aggregate, and migrate data across many HSDA implementations. Now that I have the base, I’m going to setup five separate demo implementations, and begin to work on robust sets of test data, which I can use to push forward an aggregate and federated version of HSDA.</p>

<p>The OpenAPI core for my HSDA work has allowed me to do some interesting things with how the APIs are delivered, as well as many of the supporting tooling. This approach to delivering HSDA implementations can be applied to any API. I will be taking <a href="http://schema.org.apis.apievangelist.com/">my list of several hundred Schema.org OpenAPIs</a>, and building a catalog of API definitions that can be easily deployed on AWS. I’m not going to do this as an automated software service, but I will be hand deploying solutions for clients using this approach. Providing streamlined, well-defined, yet hand-crafted API implementations for any possible situation. This was born out of hearing from HSDA providers about how they begin storing all types of data into the organizations, locations, and service data stores–things that really should be in a separate system. Eventually I’ll be suggesting other HSDA projects that assist providers with events, messaging, and other common solutions beyond just organizations, locations, and services.</p>

<p>Anyways, that concludes this sprint. I will be doing more work throughout the week, and we have a three day hackathon this week. So I’m looking forward to moving things forward more, but for right now I’m pretty glad with what I’ve achieved.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Sep 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/algo-rotoscope/stories/servers-hallway-door.jpg" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>There are a number of API service and tooling providers that I still get excited about in the space. 3Scale, Restlet, Runscope, and Tyk - to begin with my sponsors! ;-) ;-) ;-) However, there are others like Postman, APIMATIC, Materia, OAuth.io, Stoplight, Apicurio, API Platform, API Umbrella, Github, API Science, and others that keep me thinking good thoughts about the things that API service providers are doing. However, I also see a lot of services and tooling that are simply playing the startup game, and have more to do with investment, then they do about APIs.</p>

<p>It is these services and tools I see as the next generation of technical debt. When you bundle the vendors who are usually chasing trends as part of their investment and exit strategy, and really don’t care about truly helping you solve your technical, and business challenges, with your existing problems, you are just multiplying your problems. These types of customers only want you as an active customer, preferably locked into a contract, with their services and tools baked into your operations. You know what all of this leads to? Technical debt. When you buy into the vendor stories, and jump on trends, without thinking through the consequences of your actions, and the long term effects on your road map, you end up with a significant amount of technical debt down the road.</p>

<p>I have taken a number of IT and developer leadership positions in my career, where I had to come in and clean up the mess from the previous guy (always guys). Nobody was questioning the decisions being made, and allowed someone to make purchasing, and technology decisions that ended up just taking things in a bad direction. That vendor we bought into was acquired, and now that tool we depend on is part of a larger enterprise suite we really don’t need, but because we can’t unwind it from our systems, we are forced to keep paying the subscription. We went for that trendy to way of doing things, decoupling, automating, assembling a framework, offshoring, outsourcing, and whatever came along with the current technological season, and investment cycle. We didn’t invest in internal capacity, or leveraging the web and standards, and now we are locked into this proprietary way of getting things done.</p>

<p>Ok, I get it. It is hard to see what is a trend, and which vendors are full of shit. I mean, they took us out to lunch, and were real nice guys. Right? They spoke all the buzz words, and seemed to really get the problems we faced keeping things up and running. I’ve made many bad decisions when it came to leading the IT or developer charge (I used to program in ColdFusion), but most of the time these were decisions that were handed to me, not ones that I made on my own (1/3 were my bad decisions ;-). These experiences have made me very skeptical about which technology I invest in, and the world of APIs has taken this to new levels for me–I trust nobody. This is the default stance I take now. I won’t adopt something new, or change the way I do things, if there is no way to easily recover, evolve, or mitigate form the decision. While the majority of these lessons have come from unreliable APIs, I still see many folks doubling down on API services and tooling that is going to burn them down the road. I just don’t think some of us are being honest with ourselves about how all this technical debt occurs in the first place, and somehow it is all just inevitable.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Sep 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storytelling"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/photos/Millais_Boyhood_of_Raleigh.jpg" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p>If you have followed my work in the API space you know that I consider myself an API storyteller before I ever would an API evangelist, architect, or the other skills I bring to the table. Telling stories about what folks are up to in the space is the most important thing to me, and I feel it is the most common thing people stumble across, and end up associating with my brand. You hear me talk regularly about how important stories are, and how all of this API thing is only a thing, because of stories. Really, telling stories is the most important you should be doing if you are an API provider or API service provider, and something you need to be prioritizing.</p>

<p>I was talking with a friend, and client the other day about their API operations, and after they told me a great story about the impact their APIs were making I said, “you should tell that story”! Which they responded, “I wish I had time to tell that story, but I don’t. My boss doesn’t prioritize me spending time on telling stories about what we are doing.” ;-( It just broke my heart. I get really, really busy during the week with phone calls, social media, and other project related activity. However, I always will stop what I’m doing and write 3-5 blog posts for API Evangelist about what I’m doing, and what I’m seeing. I know many of the stories are mundane and probably pretty boring, but they are exercise for me, of my ideas, my words, and how I communicate with other people.</p>

<p>The way that enterprise groups and startups operate is something I’m very familiar with. I’ve been scolded by many bosses, and told not read or write on my blog. This is one of the reasons I don’t work in government anymore, or in the enterprise, as it would KILL ME to not be able to tell stories. I need storytelling to do what I do. To work through ideas. It is how I learn from others. Why would I want to do something that I can’t tell others about? Why would I not prioritize the cool things my clients are doing with my APIs? Sure, there are some classified, and sensitive situations where you definitely would not, but most of the reasons I hear for not telling stories publicly about the cool things you are doing are complete bullshit. I’m sorry, but they are. Even if you have to package it as a white paper or case study, you should be putting this down for others to learn from.</p>

<p>When you find yourself telling your creative side (or me), that you wish you had time to tell that story, you should consider that a canary in the coal mine. A sign that there is other illnesses going on. Sure, once or twice is fine, but if this becomes a sustained thing, or worse–you stop wanting to tell stories at all, then you should be looking for a new gig. You just had your mojo killed. Nobody deserves that. No employer should kills their employees storytelling mojo. Even if you are all business, telling stories is essential to making things work. Press releases are stories. Ok, they are usually a very sad, pathetic story, but they are a story. Your company blog should be active. Your personal blog should be active. Go check out your personal blog, when was the last time you wrote something you were passionate about? If it was more than a year ago, your employer has put you in a box, and is looking to keep you there.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/09/08/responding-to-a-webhook/">Responding To A Webhook</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">08 Sep 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/stripe/stripe-using-webhooks.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p>There are many details of doing APIs you don’t think about until you either a) gain the experience from doing APIs, or b) learn from the API providers already in the space. When you are just getting going with your API efforts you pretty much have to rely on b), unless you have the resources to hire a team with existing API experience. Which many of my readers will not have the luxury to do, so they need as much helping learning from the pioneers who came first, wherever they can.</p>

<p>One of the API pioneers you should be learning from is the payment API provider Stripe. <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks">I’ve been studying their approach to webhooks lately</a>, and I’ve managed to extract a number of interesting nuggets I will be sharing in separate blog posts. Today’s topic is responding to a webhook, which Stripe provides the following guidance:</p>

<p><em>To acknowledge receipt of a webhook, your endpoint should return a 2xx HTTP status code. Any other information returned in the request headers or request body is ignored. All response codes outside this range, including 3xx codes, will indicate to Stripe that you did not receive the webhook. This does mean that a URL redirection or a “Not Modified” response will be treated as a failure.</em></p>

<p>To be honest, I had never thought I should be responding to the webhooks I’ve setup. I treated them like a UDP request and once they went out the door and I processed, I didn’t need to response at all. How rude! I hadn’t seen any of my existing API providers offer up guidance in this area, or more likely I never noticed it. This is one of the reasons I like going though API providers documentation when I’m not integrating with them, because I tend to have a different eye for what is going on.</p>

<p>Anyways, I’m adding webhook responses to my list of building blocks for <a href="http://webhooks.apievangelist.com/">my webhook research</a>, and will be including it in future guidance. It seems like a pretty significant thing to help API consumers deliver to complete the webhook loop, and it injects more HTTP status code awareness and literacy into the conversation, which I think is always a good thing for everyone. Thinking about how we are signaling back and forth in the API game is always an important part of the equation.</p>

<p>I’m keeping an eye on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/">the AWS Marketplace</a>, as well as what Azure and Google are up to, looking for growing signs of anything API. I’d have to say that, while Azure is in close second, that AWS is growing faster when it comes to the availability of APIs in their marketplace. What I find interesting about this growth is it isn’t just about the cloud, it is about wholesale APIs, and as it grows it quickly becomes about API discovery as well.</p>

<p>The API conversation on AWS Marketplace has for a while been dominated by API service providers, and specifically the API management providers who have pioneered the space:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B00QHIY9OW?qid=1504806402998&amp;sr=0-7&amp;ref_=srh_res_product_title">3Scale</a></li>

</ul>

<p>After management, we see some of the familiar faces from the API space doing API aggregation, database to API deployment, security, integration platform as a service (iPaaS), real time, logging, authentication, and monitoring with Runscope.</p>

</ul>

<p>All rounding off the API lifecycle, providing a growing number of tools that API provides can deploy into their existing AWS infrastructure to help manage API operations. This is how API providers should be operating, offering retail SaaS versions of their APIs, but also cloud deployable, wholesale versions of their offerings that run in any cloud, not just AWS.</p>

<p>The portion of this aspect of API operations that is capturing my attention is the individual API providers are moving to offer their API up via AWS marketplace, moving things beyond just API service providers selling their tools to the space. Most notably are the API rockstars from the space:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=cbdb3b66-b0ad-49f9-8e00-7cfed4f5dd6c">Stripe</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=818fd455-b47c-4a62-9e3d-1a346e0f5e0e">Twilio</a></li>

</ul>

<p>After these well known API providers there are a handful of other companies offering up wholesale editions of their APIs, so that potential customers can bake into their existing infrastructure, alongside their own APIs, or possibly other 3rd party APIs.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=75a7e002-c13e-48fb-94b3-a05331a41ade">Pitney Bowes</a></li>

</ul>

<p>These APIs are offering a variety of services but real quick I noticed location, machine learning, video editing, PDFs, health care, payments, sms, and other API driven solutions. It is a pretty impressive start to what I see as the future of API discovery and deployment, as well as any other stop along the lifecycle with all the API service providers offering their warez in the marketplace.</p>

<p>I’m going to setup a monitoring script to alert me of any new API focused additions to the AWS marketplace, using of course, the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/marketplace/">AWS Marketplace API</a>. I’ve seen enough growth here to warrant the extra work, and added monitoring channel. I’m feeling like this will grow beyond my earlier thoughts about wholesale API deployment, and potentially pushing forward the API discovery conversation, and changing how we will be finding the APIs we use across our infrastructure. I will also keep an eye on Azure and Google in this area, as well as startup players like <a href="http://algorithmia.com">Algorithmia</a> who are specializing in areas like machine learning and artificial intelligence.</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Sep 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/openapi/openapi-dynamic.png" align="right" width="35%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I was brainstorming with Shelby Switzer (<a href="https://twitter.com/switzerly">@switzerly</a>) yesterday around potential projects for upcoming events we are attending, looking for interesting ideas we can push forward, and one of the ideas we settled in on, was automatically generating OpenAPIs from any open data set. We aren’t just looking for some code to do this, we are looking for a forkable, reusable way of doing this that anyone could potentially put to work making open data more accessible. It’s an interesting idea that I think could have legs, and compliment some of the existing projects I’m tackling, and would help folks make their open data more usable.</p>

<p>To develop a proof of concept I took one of my existing projects for <a href="http://api.integration.tool.apievangelist.com/">publishing an API integration page within the developer portal of API providers</a>, and replaced the hand crafted OpenAPI with a dynamic one. <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist-tools/api-integration/blob/master/_data/integrations.yaml">The project is driven from a single YAML data file</a>, which I manage and publish using Google Sheets, and already had a static API and OpenAPI documentation, making it a perfect proof of concept. As I said, the OpenAPI is currently static YAML, so I got to work making it dynamically driven from the YAML data store. The integrations.yaml data store has eight fields, which I hd published as four separate API paths, depending on which category each entry is in. I was able to assemble the OpenAPI using a handful of variables already in the config.yaml for the project, but the rest I was able to generate by mounting the integrations.yaml, dynamically identifying the fields and the field types, and then generating the API paths, and schema definitions needed in the OpenAPI.</p>

<p>It’s totally hacky at the moment, and just a proof of concept, but it works. I’m using <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist-tools/api-integration/blob/master/apis/openapi.yaml">the dynamically generated OpenAPI</a> to drive <a href="http://api.integration.tool.apievangelist.com/documentation/">the Swagger UI documentation</a> on the project. I’m not sure why I hadn’t thought of this before, but this is why I spend time hanging with smart folks like Shelby, who ask good questions, and are curious about pushing forward concepts like this. Liquid, the language used by Jekyll to deliver HTML in Github driven project like this is very limiting, providing some serious constraints when it comes to delivering tools like this. As I get stronger in my knowledge of it, and push the boundaries of what it can do, I’m able to do some pretty interesting things on top of YAML and JSON data stored on Github, within Jekyll sites like this. It can be pretty hacky, and would make many programmers cringe, but I like it.</p>

<p>While the idea needs a lot more work, it provides an interesting seed for how OpenAPI can be generated from a single (or multiple) open data file in CSV, JSON, or YAML–which Jekyll speaks natively. The possibilities to commit open data files into a Github repo and have OpenAPI, schema, documentation, and even UI elements automatically generated is pretty huge. This approach to making open data accessible holds a significant amount of potential when it comes to making the open data more discoverable, accessible, forkable, and reusable–which all open data should be by default. I will keep pushing the idea forward, and see where Shelby takes it, and report back here when I have anything more to share.</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Sep 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/human-services/human-services-docs-screenshot.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I am currently crafting a set of services as part of <a href="http://org.open.referral.adopta.agency/">my Human Sevices Data API (API) work</a>. The core set of services for organizations, locations, and services are grouped together as a single service, as this is what I was handed, but all the additional APIs I introduce will be bundled as separate set of individual services. Over the last couple of weeks I’ve introduced seven new services, with a handful more coming in the near future. I’m enjoying this way of focusing on services, over the legacy way that is very resource focused, as I feel like it lets me step back and look at the big picture.</p>

<p>When I was defining the core API for this work I was very centered on the resources I was making available (organization, locations, and services), but once I took on a service mindset I began to see a number of things I was missing. With each service I find myself thinking about the full life cycle, not just the APIs that deliver the service. I’m thinking about the easy ones like design, deployment, and management, but I’m also thinking about monitoring, testing, and security. Then I’m delivering documentation, support, communications, and thinking about my monetization strategy, and access plans. I’m not just doing this once, I am thinking about it in the context of each individual service, as well as across all of them, taking care of the business of the services I’m delivering, not just the technical.</p>

<p>While some folks I talk to look at some of this as repeat work across my projects, I just see them as common patterns, that I should be reusing, refining, and delivering in consistent ways. I’m thinking about delivering the technology in a consistent way, and the operational, but I’m beginning to think about education, training, and how I can help folks on the provider and consumer side of things learn how things are working. I’m not just doing the technical heavy lifting to deliver APIs and then walking away, I’m bundling each search with what is needed to be valuable and successful as an actual service, that is API driven from start to finish. The service is accessible via an API, but it is also delivered, managed, and supported using APIs–everything has an API.</p>

<p>The Human Services Data APIs (HSDA) I am delivering aren’t just a single API, or set of service. They are an open source set of services that I’m putting out there for others to adopt and deliver as part of their own operations. I don’t want these to just be plug and play APIs, and want them to be plug and play services that deliver the information people need to find vital services in their community. Thinking of my APIs as services, and breaking them up into independent microservices helps me address the technical, business, and politics of delivering the technical components cities and organizations are needing. I’ve been pushing the business and politics of APIs since I’ve started, and trying to doing things in as small pieces as I can since the beginning, but the microservices conversations I’ve been tuning into have helped me think beyond the tech, the size, and actually consider how I’m doing this to deliver services to humans–it just an interesting twist that my primary project is all about delivering human service microservices. ;-)</p>

<p>I’m gearing up for a conversation about the next edition of the FOIA API, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/09/07/an-openapi-contract-for-the-freedom-of-information/">in preparation I’ve created an OpenAPI definition to help guide the conversation</a>, which I drafted based upon <a href="https://github.com/18F/beta.foia.gov/blob/master/agency-api-spec.md">the specifications published to Github</a> by the FOIA API team at 18F. This was after spending some time reading through <a href="https://github.com/18F/foia-recommendations/blob/master/recommendations.md">the FOIA recommendations for the project</a>, which is also published to Github. Having the project information available on Github, makes it easy for analysts like me to quickly get up to speed on what is going on, and provide valuable feedback to the team.</p>

<p>In my opinion, EVERY government API should start with a Github repo flushing out the needs and requirements for the project, exactly like 18F is doing as part of their FOIA work. All the details of the project are there for not just the project team, but for external participants like myself. When it comes to engaging with folks like me, the API project team doesn’t have to do anything, except send me a link to the Github repository, and maybe point out some specifics, but if the README is complete, only <a href="https://github.com/18F/foia-recommendations/">the repo link is necessary</a>. <a href="https://github.com/18F/foia-recommendations/issues">This opens up conversation around the project using Github Issues</a>, which leaves a history of the discussions that are occurring throughout the project’s life cycle. Any newcomers can invest the time into digesting the documentation, discussion, and then begin to constructively add value to what is already happening.</p>

<p>I know this type of transparent, observable project performance is hard for many folks in government. Hell, it is hard for 18F, and people like myself who do it regularly, by default. It takes a certain fortitude to do things out in the open like this, but this is precisely why you should be doing it. The process injects sunlight into ALL government projects by default. You know your work will be scrutinized from day one, all the way to delivery, so you tend to have your act together. It forces you to open up to other folks ideas and feedback, which isn’t always pleasant, but when done right, can make or break an API project. I mean, your API is going to be public, why not kick it off in the same way? Doing public APIs are all about learning, growing, and establishing a sort of R&amp;D lab around a specific set of resources and services. If this is baked into the DNA of your API project, the chances the API itself will find success is much greater.</p>

<p>I spend a lot of time interfacing with government agencies around APIs. I spend more unpaid time on the phone with folks, and with the right groups I am more than happy to do this. However, I regularly encounter groups who are looking to do APIs, don’t have any existing public APIs, and no Github presence. These are the individuals I encounter who have the worst skills at working well with others, coherently sharing documentation, and many of these projects never get off the ground due to politics. Doing public APIs helps us learn how to be more transparent, observable, and accountable for the projects we are delivering. It isn’t always easy work. It is something that is a journey, and we get better at over time. More government agencies should be working with, and learning from 18F when it comes to delivering projects using Github. Your agency will be better off for it, and the public will benefit from a more observable, and accountable government.</p>

<p>Today’s stories are all based around my preparation for providing some feedback on the next edition of the FOIA.gov API. I have a call with the project team, and want to provide ongoing feedback, so I am loading the project up in my brain, and doing some writing on the topic. The first thing that I do when getting to know any API project, now matter where it is at in it’s lifecycle, is craft an <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification">OpenAPI</a>, which will act as a central contract for discussions. Plus, there is no better way, short of integration, to get to know an API than crafting a complete (enough) OpenAPI definition.</p>

<p>After looking through <a href="https://github.com/18F/foia-recommendations/blob/master/recommendations.md">the FOIA recommendations for the project</a>, I took the draft FOIA API specification and crafted this OpenAPI definition:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/ca85e904c05e1ec28c6d277f62be2f80.js"></script>

<p>The specification is just for a single path, that allows you to POST a FOIA request. I made sure I thought through the supporting schema that gets posted, flushing out using the definitions (JSON schema) portion of the OpenAPI. This helps me see all the moving parts, and connect the dots between the API request and response, complete with definition for three HTTP status codes (200,404,500)–just the basics. Now I can see the technical details of a FOIA request in my head, preparing me for my discussion with the project owners.</p>

<p>After loading the technical details in my head, I always like to step back and think about the business, political, and ultimately human aspects of this. This is a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) API, being used by U.S. citizens to request that information within the federal government be freed. That is pretty significant, and represents why I do API Evangelist. I enjoy helping ensure APIs like this exist, are usable, and become a reality. It is interesting to think of the importance of this OpenAPI contract, and the potential it will have to make information in government more accessible. Providing a potential blueprint that can be used by all federal agencies, establishing a common interface for how the public can engage with government when it comes to holding it more accountable.</p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Sep 2017</span>
        <p><a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-heart-monitor.png" align="right" width="35%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p>I am at that all too familiar place with a project where I am having to decide whether I want to build what I need, or depend on an API service provider. As an engineer it is always easy to think you can just build what you need, but the more experience you have, you begin to realize this isn’t always the smartest move. I’m at that point with API monitoring. I have a growing number of endpoints that I need to make sure are alive and active, but I also see an endless road map of detailed requests when it comes to granularity of what “alive and active” actually means.</p>

<p>At first I was just going to use my default cron job service to hit the base url and API paths defined in my OpenAPI for each project, checking for the expected HTTP status code. Then I thought I better start checking for a valid schema. Then I thought I better start checking for valid data. My API project is an open source solution, and I thought about each of my clients and implementations as me for testing and monitoring for their needs. Then I thought, no way!! I’m just going to use <a href="http://apis.how/8nlsropidv">Runscope</a>, and build in documentation and processes that each of my clients and implementations can also use Runscope to dial in monitoring and testing of their API on their own terms.</p>

<p>Since all of my API projects is OpenAPI driven, and Runscope is an OpenAPI driven API service provider (as ALL should be), I can use this as the seed for setting up testing and monitoring. Not all of my API implementations will be using 100% of the microservices I’m defining, or 100% of the API paths available fo each of the microservices I’m defining. Each microservice has it’s core set of paths that deliver the service, but then I’m also bundling in database, server, DNS, logging and other microservice operational level APIs that not all my implementations will care about monitoring (sadly). So it is important for my clients and implementations to be easily select with APIs they care about monitoring, which OpenAPI will help do the heavy lifting. When it comes to exactly what API monitoring and testing means to them, I’ll rely on Runscope to do the heavy lifting.</p>

<p>If Runscope didn’t have the ability to import an OpenAPI to plant the seeds for API testing and monitoring I might have opted to just build out a basic solution myself. The manual process of setting up my API monitoring and testing for each client would quickly become more work than just building a solution–even if it was nowhere near as good as Runscope. However, we are increasingly living in an OpenAPI driven API lifecycle where service providers of all shapes and sizes allow for the importing and exporting of common API definition formats like OpenAPI. Helping API providers and architects like myself stick to what we do best, and not reinvent the wheel for each stop along the API lifecycle.</p>

<p><strong>Disclosure:</strong> <a href="http://apis.how/8nlsropidv">Runscope</a> is an API Evangelist partner.</p>

        <span class="post-date">06 Sep 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/github/github-oauth-application.png" align="right" width="20%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I was creating a very light-weight API management solution for one of my projects the other day, and I wanted to give my API consumers a quick and dirty way to begin making calls against the API. Most of the API paths are publicly available, but there were a handful of POST, PUT, and DELETE paths I didn’t want to just have open to the public. I didn’t feel like this situation warranted a full blown API management solution like <a href="http://apis.how/zflfesymzk">Tyk</a> or <a href="http://apis.how/ake3nxbapm">3Scale</a>, but if I could just let people authenticate with their existing Github account, it would suffice.</p>

<p>This project has it’s own Github organization, with each of the APIs living as open source API repositories, so I just leveraged Github, and the ability to create Github OAuth applications to do what I needed. You can find OAuth applications under your Github organizational settings, and when you are creating it, all you really need is to give the application a name, description, and a home page and callback URL, then you are given a client id and secret you can use to authenticate individual users with their Github accounts. I didn’t even have to do the complete OAuth dance to get access to resources, or refresh tokens (may will soon), I was just able to implement a single page PHP script to accomplish what I needed for this version:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/25e58174ed8b51a30274a3b371b4ca02.js"></script>

<p>I am wiring this script up to a Github login icon on my developer portal, and each API consumer will be routed to Github to authenticate, and then the page will handle the callback where I capture the valid Github OAuth token, and the login, name, email, and other basic Github information about the user. Right now the API is open to anyone who authenticates, but eventually I will be evaluating the maturity of the Github account, and limiting access based upon a variety of criteria (number of repos, account creation date, etc.). For now, I’m just looking for a quick and dirty way to allow my API consumers to get access to resources without creating yet another account. Normally I would be using OAuth.io for this, but I’m trying to minimize dependencies on 3rd party services for this project, and Github OAuth applications plus this script worked well.</p>

<p>Once a user is authenticated they can use their Github user name as the appid, and the valid Github OAuth token as the appkey, which are both passed through as headers, leveraging encryption in transport. I’m not overly worried about security of my APIs, this is more about a first line of defense and identifying consumers, however I will be validating the token with particular API calls. I’m also considering publishing API consumption data to Github repository created within each users accounts as part of API activity, publishing it as YAML, with a simple dashboard for view (authenticated with Github of course). I’ve had this model in my head for some time, and have written about it before, but I’m just now getting around to having a project to implement it in. I’m calling it my poor man’s API management, and something that can be done on a budget (FREE), but if my needs grow any further I will be using a more professional grade solution like <a href="http://apis.how/ake3nxbapm">3Scale</a> or <a href="http://apis.how/zflfesymzk">Tyk</a>.</p>

<p>I consume a huge amount of blog and Twitter feeds each week. I evaluate the stories published by major tech blogs, cloud providers, and individual API providers. In my work there is a significant amount of duplicity in stories, mostly because of press release regurgitation, but one area I watch closely is the volume of stories coming out of major cloud computing providers around specific topics that are relevant to APIs. One of these topics I’m watching closely is the new area of serverless, and what type of stories each providers are putting out there.</p>

<p>Amazon has long held the front runner position because AWS Lambda was the first major cloud provider to do serverless, coining the term, and dominating the conversation with their brand of API evangelism. However, in the last couple months I have to say that Microsoft is matching AWS when it comes to the storytelling coming out of Azure in the area of serverless and function as a service (FaaS). Amazon definitely has an organic lead in the conversation, but when it comes to the shear volume, and regular drumbeat of serverless stories Microsoft is keeping pace. After watching several months of sustained storytelling, it looks like they could even pass up Amazon in the near future.</p>

<p>When you are down in the weeds you tend to not see how narratives spread across the space, and the power of this type of storytelling, but from my vantage point, it is how all the stories we tell at the ground level get seeded, and become reality. It isn’t something you can do overnight, and very few organizations have the resources, and staying power to make this type of storytelling a sustainable thing. I know that many startups and enterprise groups simply see this as content creation and syndication, but that is the quickest way to make your operations unsustainable. Nobody enjoys operating a content farm, and if nobody cares about the content when it is being made, then nobody will care about the content when it is syndicated and consumed–this is why I tell stories, and you should to.</p>

<p>Stories are how all of this works. It is stories that developers tell within their circles that influence what tools they will adopt. It is stories at the VC level that determine which industries, trends, and startups they’ll invest in. <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/">Think about the now infamous Jeff Bezos mandate</a>, which has been elevated to mythical status, and contributed to much of the cloud adoption we have seen to date. It is this kind of storytelling that will determine each winner of the current and future battles between cloud giants. Whether it is serverless, devops, microservices, machine learning, artificial intelligence, internet of things, and any other scifi, API-driven topic we can come up with in the coming years. I have to admit, it is interesting to see Microsoft do so well in the area of storytelling after many years of sucking at it.</p>

<p>I have been working on the next version of <a href="http://org.open.referral.adopta.agency/">my human services work</a>, which provides a way for cities to make information about organizations, locations, and services available on the web. Part of the feedback from the community around what was missing from the last version, was the number of API calls you needed to make to get a complete representation of a resource, and its sub-resources, as each API response was one dimensional. An example would be that you could get a list of locations, but to get at the list of services you had to make a separate API call. This wasn’t a lapse in API design, it was a result of the schema being born out of a CSV format, and me working to stay true to the original design, and usage of the schema.</p>

<p>In the latest version, I did release a handful of paths that provide a complete representation of each resource and it’s sub-resources. However, I have maintained the original one dimension representation of each resource and sub-resources, allowing me to offer an XML, JSON, as well as CSV representation for each API call. This allows API consumers to pull CSV lists of organizations, locations, services, and their sub-resources like address and phone lists. While not something that would be useful in all API implementations, I feel like the audience for municipal level human services data will benefit significantly being able to go from API to spreadsheet in a single step. All the GET paths for organizations, locations, and services are publicly available by default, not requiring authentication, making CSV data available via a single URL–something anyone can make happen.</p>

<p>While weighing API design decisions as part of my Human Services Data API (HSDA) work I am having to consider not just the technical of how I should be doing this. I am also deeply considering how the API will be put to use, and who will be doing that. While I am thinking about the heavy system to system integration needs of human service providers, as well as the web, mobile, and other applications. I am also thinking about the individual user who might just need a list of the names of organizations, or the addresses of services in a simple CSV format, so that they can work with the data in their most familiar format–the spreadsheet. I am just focusing on the API side of things at the moment, but once I’m done with the latest version I am going to think about some simple linking, and embeddable tooling that allows users to put CSV data from the API to work in a single click using Google Sheets, and Microsoft Excel.</p>

<p>I was reading a story on GraphQL this weekend which I won’t be linking to or citing because that is what they want, and they do not deserve the attention, that was just (yet) another hating on REST post. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/06/12/revisiting-graphql-as-part-of-my-api-toolbox/">As I’ve mentioned before, the GraphQL’s primary strength seems to be they have endless waves of bros who love to write blog posts hating on REST, and web APIs</a>. This particular post shows it’s absurdity by stating that HTTP is just a bad idea, wait…uh what? Yeah, you know that thing we use for the entire web, apparently it’s just not a good idea when it comes to exchanging data. Ok, buddy.</p>

<p>When it comes to GraphQL, I’m still watching, learning, and will continue evaluating it as a tool in my API toolbox, but when it comes to the argument of GraphQL vs. Web APIs I will just be waiting out the current assault as I did with all the other haters. The link data haters ran out of steam. The hypermedia haters ran out of steam. The GraphQL haters will also run out steam. All of these technologies are viable tools in our API toolbox, but NONE of them are THE solution. These assaults on “what came before” is just a very tired tactic in the toolbox of startups–you hire young men, give them some cash (which doesn’t last for long), get them all wound up, and let them loose talking trash on the space, selling your warez.</p>

<p>GraphQL has many uses. It is not a replacement for web APIs. It is just one tool in our toolbox. If you are following the advice of any of these web API haters you will wake up in a couple of years with a significant amount of technical debt, and probably also be very busy chasing the next wave of technology be pushed by vendors. My advice is that all API providers learn about the web, gain several years of experience developing web APIs, learn about linked data, hypermedia, GraphQL, and even gRPC if you have some high performance, high volume needs. Don’t spend much time listening to the haters, as they really don’t deserve your attention. Eventually they will go away, find another job, and technological kool-aid to drink.</p>

<p>In my opinion, there is (almost) always a grain of usefulness with each wave of technology that comes along. The trick is cutting through the bullshit, tuning out the haters, and understanding what is real and what is not real when it comes to the vendor noise. You should not be adopting every trend that comes along, but you should be tuning into the conversation and learning. After you do this long enough you will begin to see the patterns and tricks used by folks trying to push their warez. Hating on whatever came before is just one of these tricks. This is why startups hire young, energetic, an usually male voices to lead this charge, as they have no sense of history, and truly believe what they are pushing. Your job as a technologist is to develop the experience necessary to know what is real, and what is not, and keep a cool head as the volume gets turned up on each technological assault.</p>

<p>I am a big fan of <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, the static content management system (CMS). <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist">All of API Evangelist runs as hundreds of little Jekyll driven Github repositories</a>, in a sort of microservices concert, allowing me to orchestrate my research, data, and the stories I tell across all of my projects. I recommend that API providers launch their API portals using Jekyll, whether you choose to run on Github, or anywhere else using the light-weight portable solution. I have <a href="http://portal.minimum.apievangelist.com/">several Jekyll templates I use to to fork and turn into new API portals</a>, providing me with a robust toolbox for making APIs more usable.</p>

<p>My friend and collaborator James Higginbotham(<a href="https://twitter.com/launchany">@launchany</a>) has launched <a href="https://launchany.github.io/mvd-template/">a new minimum viable documentation (MVD) template for APIs</a>, providing API provides with everything they need out of the gate when it comes to a presence for their API. The MVD solution provides you with a place for your getting started, workflows, code samples, reference material, with OpenAPI as the heartbeat–providing you with everything you need when it comes to API documentation. <a href="https://github.com/launchany/mvd-template">It all is an open source package available on Github</a>, allowing any API provider to fork and quickly change the content and look and feel to match your needs. Which in my opinion, is the way ALL API documentation solutions should be. None of us should be re-inventing the wheel when it comes to our API portals, there are too many good examples out their to follow.</p>

<p>I know that Jekyll is intimidating for many folks. I’m currently dealing with this on several fronts, but trust me when I say that Jekyll will become one of the most important tools in your API toolbox. It takes a bit to learn the structure of Jekyll, and get over some of the quirks of learning to program using Liquid, but once you do, it will open up a whole new world for you. It is much more than just a static content management system (CMS). For me, it’s most significant strength has become as a data management system (DMS)??, with OpenAPI as the heart. I use Jekyll (and Github) for managing all my OpenAPI definitions, JSON and YAML files, and increasingly publishing my data sets in this way instead of relying on server-side technology. If you are looking for an new solution when it comes to your API portal, <a href="https://launchany.github.io/mvd-template/">I recommend taking a look at what James is up to</a>.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/09/05/api-evangelist-is-a-performance/">API Evangelist Is A Performance</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">05 Sep 2017</span>
        <p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/t-shirts/KL_InApiWeTrust-1000.png" align="right" width="30%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I think I freaked a couple of folks out last week, so I wanted to take a moment and remind folks that API Evangelist is a performance. Sure, it is rooted in my personality, and I keep it as true to my view of the world of APIs as I can, but it is just a performance I do daily. When I sit down at the keyboard and research the world of APIs I am truly (mostly) interested in the technology, but when I craft the words you read here on the blog I am performing a dance that is meant to be interesting to the technology community in a way that draws them in, but then also gives them a swift kick in the pants when it comes to ethics of the technology, business, and politics of doing all of this.</p>

<p>Sure, my personality shines through all of this, and I’m being genuine when I talk about my own battles with mental illness, and other things, but please remember API Evangelist is a performance. It is a performance that is meant to counteract the regular stream of fake news that comes out of the Silicon Valley funded technology machine. <a href="http://contrafabulists.com/">API Evangelist is a Contrabulist production</a>, pushing back on the often exploitative nature of APIs. Not that APIs are exploitative, it is the people who are doing APIs are exploitative. Back in 2010, I saw that APIs were providing a peek behind the increasingly black box nature of web technology that was invading our lives through our mobile devices, and jumped at the opportunity to jam my foot in the door, even as the VC power brokers continue to look to look for ways to close this door.</p>

<p>In 2011, I found my voice as the API Evangelist explaining APIs to the normals, making these often abstract things more accessible. Along the way, I also developed the tone of this voice pushing back on the politics of doing APIs, calling out the illnesses I see in the space. These are the two areas I hear the most praise from my readers, something that has significantly shaped my performance over the last seven years. I have a pantheon of API characters in my head when I tell stories on API Evangelist, speaking to specific groups, while showcasing as many of the best practices from the space as I possibly can. I’m looking to shine a light on the good, first and foremost, but I’m also never going to shy away from showcasing the illnesses in the space as I have nothing to lose. I’m never looking to get VC funding, or do any technology startup, so throwing myself against the machine doesn’t ever worry me–I will keep doing it until I grow weary of this production.</p>

<p>I just wanted to take the time to help folks understand that all of this is a show. Sure, my rant last week was rooted in my own dark personal thoughts, but it was meant to be a reflection of the space (your darkness). I’m touched at the folks who reached out to me with concern, but I’m fine. If I am ranting on the Internet you can always be sure I’m fine. It is when I go silent for any sustained amount of time is when you should have concern. When I’m in my dark place I have NO interest in performing as API Evangelist, and increasingly I have little interest in Internet technology when I feel this way. If you are reading this, thank you for tuning into my little production. I enjoy doing it because it keeps me learning each day. It keeps me writing and telling stories each day. Hopefully along the way some of you also get some value from the stories I tell, whether their are positive, or a little dark like they were last week.</p>

        <span class="post-date">05 Sep 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/kin-lane/kin-lane-api-evangelist-cartoon.png" align="right" width="25%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>With such a dark week of blog posts last week I wanted to make sure and start this week off with a brighter post, talking about the good I see in the API space. It can be easy to find than some of the darker things I talked about, but after seven years doing this I see enough good things going on in the API community, that I keep doing this performance I call API Evangelist. It can be easy to rant and rave about the bad, but I find it takes a lot of work to identify the good things going on in the cracks, as they rarely get the attention of the mainstream tech community propaganda engine.</p>

<p>First, there are some really smart folks who truly care about human beings and are dedicated to the world of APIs. I do not know of any other layer of technology that sustains a community of people that is not just about startups and mindless moving forward of technology in every industry. I can use all of my fingers counting the folks who truly care about doing APIs, and making a meaningful impact with them. I have had the pleasure of working with these folks, and brining many of them together as part of my APIStrat conference, and regularly enjoy learning from them, reading their stories, and engaging with them on a regular basis as part of this API journey.</p>

<p>Second, not all APIs are startup focused. I work with many API providers who are doing very interesting, non-startup, non-VC investment, and most importantly, non-exploitative API things. I regularly work with passionate folks doing APIs at all levels of government, making an impact on the environment, pushing for transparency in our legal system, helping provide human services, and truly making change in a meaningful way using web APIs. APIs are neither good, nor bad, or are they neutral, they are simply a reflection of their creators and operators. It keeps me going, to learn about the many ways in which APIs are being used for good, and moving beyond their startup origins, doing meaningful things that makes the lives of human beings better.</p>

<p>Third, APIs are just the next evolution of the web. All the bad things I talked about last week can just as easily be applied to the web. APIs do not have to be the next vendor solution, or something you have to buy. APIs are just about moving our bits and bytes around online, using low cost web technology. They often become the scapegoat for exploitation, unreliability, security, and privacy concerns, but as I said before they are just a reflection of their creator and operators. This is one of the main reasons I’m an evangelist for APIs, not because they are always a good idea, but because when they are done right, they can bring some important observability into some existing technological situations, helping us understand exactly what is going on behind the digital and algorithmic curtain.</p>

<p>It was a learning experience to spend a week ranting openly about the space last week. The way people responded, or didn’t response was very telling about the API community. It feels like something I will be doing regularly (maybe not at that scale), because I felt like it pushed back much of the illness in the space that can become very suffocating to an independent operator like me. The venture backed technology machine doesn’t always realize (or maybe it does) what an invasive and assaulting force it is. They think they are just asking for some free time, or for a guest post opportunity, and don’t often see how damaging they are, because everyone is doing it. I feel like I was able to carve out a defensive zone around what I do, even if it was just for a bit. Thanks again for all your support folks.</p>

        <span class="post-date">01 Sep 2017</span>
        <p><img src="http://i1.wp.com/restlet.dreamhosters.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/kinlane.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px" /></p>
<p>I know many of you are thinking Kin Lane has lost his marbles (again). In reality, I lost them last week for a couple days because someone really pissed me off, then after a couple more folks pissing in my Cheerios, I checked out last week (this happens from time to time). This week I am actually feeling quite fine after moving to NYC from LA, but the posts for the last couple of days are from my notebook entries made while in a dark place last week. Normally, these posts would never see the light of day, but I’m feeling like they probably should this week. Its no secret, I’m fairly sure I’d be classified in the bi-polar realm (never been diagnosed), something I’ve thoroughly enjoyed since I was a teen, but for the last 20 years is something I’ve had 96% control of. I get angry, fly off the handle sometimes, and have bouts of depression, and life feels like a roller coaster, but for the most part I know the signals, know when to check out, and I am actually able leverage it to my favor–crafting the person that you all know as API Evangelist. It is the fuel for my research, and how I write these words.</p>

<p>Shocking? Run you off? Ok. I’ll accept that. I just wanted to show my readers the contrast between the night and the day, and showcase how hard I work to be really, really nice, and highlight the best of the API space on a daily regular basis. I’m hoping the honesty helps you see what is really going on, with the contrast showing you how much I work to sift through the world of APIs and find useful nuggets of information you might find valuable in your API journey. I really do enjoy what I do as the API Evangelist (most of the time), and I take pleasure in helping people understand the good and the bad of it, in as nice as possible way as I can. What grinds my gears is the folks who feel they need to jump on me, question my motivations, assume there is a hidden agenda, or just inflict their messed up version of the world on this magical world I’ve manage to carve out for myself (for all of us). I may seem pushy and intense this week, but I’m guessing y’all are in denial about how pushy and intense about the things you are passionate about in your world.</p>

<p>I also want to take a moment to highlight the mental illness that exists in the tech sector. It is everywhere if you know what to look for. How do you think I’m able to wrap my head around everything going on with APIs, and why I am an autodidact, and have an affinity for computers from an early age? Most of the white men programmers y’all are putting on a pedestal are mentally ill, they are either just really good at hiding it, or are so privileged that nobody has diagnosed or called them out for it. It is why they are so good at the computerz and Internetz. It is why many are taking pharmaceuticals and microdosing. Trust me, I’ve been there. Done that. Give them 10, 20 years, a divorce, more startup failures, and health problems, you’ll see more of them lose their shit. It is just a matter of time. The real danger there is that most of them don’t know they are ill, or are in denial. I got hints when I was 16, and saw the full spectrum from 20-25, then by the time my daughter was born at 28 I had already figured out most of the telltale signs I needed to keep myself grounded–most of the time. There are still exceptions, and moments when things sneak up on me.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/kin-lane/kin-lane-talks.jpg" align="right" width="25%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>As you read my posts this week, I’m sure you were like damn. WTF is going on? He’s paranoid, wacky, or unhinged. Read them all again, I’m only speaking truth. Is the racism and sexism that is ubiquitous in the tech industry any more crazy than me? Is the endless quest for money at all costs in the startup world any whackier than what I’ve written? Following every trend. Telling wild tales of what computer and technology is capable of. Worshipping the tech gods like Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, Marc Andressen, Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos and others any more sane that what I do as the API Evangelist? Is the exploitation of people’s privacy and security anymore more sane than what I’m putting forth about the API space? Is ignoring what advertising is doing to the web all about logical straightforward thinking? What makes tech CEOs, and entrepreneurs so much more valuable than teachers, nurses, and other folks? Y’all seem way crazier than I do. I’m sorry. It is just the crazy you know, and is being sensationalized–normalized.</p>

<p>I’m just living, doing what I love, studying the world of APIs, and trying to share my knowledge through my writing. I’m not exploiting and taking advantage of you to get rich. I’m just trying to make a living, and make sense of this Internet age we find ourselves in. Which I have to say that your crazy, seems to making the world a pretty crazy place lately, with Trump and all. Just saying. Anyways, I’m going to take things back down a notch. I’m going to stay off the phone with some of you crazy folks, and stay out of your chaotic companies and organization, and settle back in with my nice NPR like API Evangelist tone. So please don’t come pissing me off again, make sure and pay your invoices, and don’t pick fights with me, and hopefully we won’t have to go here again. I’ll keep things way more sane, less rantier, with just the occasional amping up of things to make some points get across properly along the way.</p>

<p>I also want to thank all of you who reached out privately to make sure I was ok. This means the world to me. You guys are my heroes, and I encourage more of you to do this with other folks in the space. Together, maybe we can all take the crazy down a notch or two and begin to get things back to normal. I have a pretty good handle on my crazy, but I know there are many other folks out there that need your help right now. We need more discussion, education, and support when it comes to mental illness in the space. I personally have talked two people down off the ledge privately in my time as the API Evangelist, and I’m sure there are plenty of others I haven’t have the chance to help. So please talk to each other, and be understanding. You never know when someone might be slipping into the dark.</p>

<p>As I told Tony Tam (my hero) earlier this week–thanks for putting up with me, I really appreciate it.</p>

        <span class="post-date">01 Sep 2017</span>

<p>Don’t who know who I am? I am the API Evangelist. Ok, I know this post is dripping with ego. However, it is the last post in my week of API rants, and I’m just pumped from writing all of these. These types of posts are so easy to write because I don’t have to do any research, and real work, I just write, putting my mad skills at whitesplaining and mansplaining to work–tapping into my privilege. So I’m going to end the week with a bang, and fully channel the ego that has developed along with the persona that is API Evangelist.</p>

<p>However, there is a touch of truth to this. If you are operating an API today, and you do not know who I am, I’m just going to put it out there–you live in a silo. I have published around 3,000 blog posts since 2010 on APIs. I’m publishing 3-5 posts a day, and have consistently done so for seven years. There are definitely some major gaps in that, but my SEO placement is pretty damn good. You type API or APIs, and I’m in the top 30 usually, with the occasional popping up on home page. The number thing I get from folks who message me is that they can’t search for anything API without coming across one of my posts, so they want to talk to me. So why is it that you do not know who I am? I have some ideas on that.</p>

<p>It is because you do not read much outside your silo. When you do, you don’t give any credit to authorship. So when you have read any of my posts you didn’t associate them with a person named Kin Lane. You operate within your silo 98% of the time, and the 2% you get out, you really don’t read much, or learn from others. I on the other hand spend 98% of my time studying what others are doing, and 2% hiding away. My goal is to share this with you. I’d say 75% of my work is just referencing and building on the work of others, only 25% is of my own creation. I’m putting all of this out there for you, and you don’t even know it exists. What does that tell you about your information diet? It tells me that you probably aren’t getting enough exercise and nutrients as part of your regular daily intake, that will make your API operations be less healthy and strong–reading is good for healthy bones girls and boys!</p>

<p>Kin Lane doesn’t have this much ego, but API Evangelist does. The fact that you don’t know who I am shows you aren’t spending enough time studying the API space before launching an API. I’m hoping that you in your API journey you learn more about the importance of coming out of your bubble, and learning from your community, and the wider API community. It is why we do APIs, and why APIs work (when they do). I wrote this title to be provocative and part of my week of rants, but honestly it is true. If you haven’t come across one of my API posts, and stumbled on my blog at some point you should probably think about why this is. The most successful API providers and evangelists I know are tuned into their communities, industries, and wider API space, and are familiar with my work–even if they don’t all like me. ;-)</p>

<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> If my writing is a little dark this week, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/08/28/api-rant-vs-api-research/">here is a little explainer</a>–don’t worry, things will back to normal at API Evangelist soon.</em></p>

<p>You know your API stuff. You know it so well, you don’t even need to look at other APIs. There is no reason to Google and look for other APIs because your stuff is that good. Your idea came to you in a flash, and you worked for an entire weekend to bring to life. Your a genius. Everyone has told you so. This stuff just comes to you, and as long as you are left alone, the magic just happens. If people just stay out of your way, do not burden you with outside influences, and unnecessary concerns, you will keep rolling out amazing APIs that everyone will love and need.</p>

<p>You consume books, and digest endless blog posts and white papers recommended by your trusted network of friends. You don’t ever notice authorship. They don’t matter. It is all about feeding your mind, and you will decide whether it is worthy or not. You don’t save bookmarks for citations or attributions, once inside your brain ALL ideas becomes yours. If someone’s idea is dumb, you make sure an let them know, making sure they are aware of how they are substandard and beneath you. If your friends let you know your ideas are amazing, you let them know they are great too, and will be rewarded by being in your presence, and part of your team.</p>

<p>That one chick that was hired last year made the mistake of blurting out in a meeting, “isn’t that the same thing as that startup that launched last month?”. She isn’t on the core team anymore. You did look at what she was talking about, and their API design is inferior, and the look of their site just turned you off–no need to continue. This is why you don’t conduct due diligence for your API projects. Why spend time looking at so many bad ideas? It takes away from your time to make the magic happen. Why do people keep wasting your time with this stuff? It is clear your ideas are superior, just look at your numbers. Clearly your APIs are well received, and all the feedback from partners have been great. I mean 60% of top startups in the sector are using your service, who cares what else is out there.</p>

<p>All of this is true in your bubble, but it won’t always pencil out outside. What you do not know or see will always eventually begin to diminish your work. The aspects of the markets you don’t see will never see the value of your work. You will never truly grow and evolve if you do not acknowledge the ideas that have influenced you. You weren’t born with all this knowledge, you are learning, borrowing, stealing, and building on the ideas of others. You should always learn from what is already out there, even if it is the worst of the worst. Through studying your competition your ideas will become hardened and truly competitive, and they will have strength when operating outside your bubble, beyond your control. You never know, you might actually come across a gem in the pile of bad ideas, something or someone you never imagined. Something that might shift the paradigm for you.</p>

<p>In your youth, this type of isolation, and bubble creation might work, but eventually you will miss certain signals and trends. There will be market forces that you and your network will miss, and once you begin to fall behind, it will be difficult to catch up. You will be building genius APIs that nobody wants or understands because your work as lost its relevance and context. You may have your finger on the pulse now, but you are not being honest with yourself about how you found that pulse, and are too confident that you will always have it. A significant part of your success has been your privilege, and that you are playing in this game while things are still new. With each wave of growth, and entry of new players, you will become irrelevant, and eventually old and in the way. The new geniuses will make the same mistakes you did, and shut you out, just like you have done to so many. It is how all of this works as time moves on.</p>

<p>I know you are used to people telling you that you are creative, and your ideas are great, but I’m here to tell you they aren’t. You lack any imagination, creativity, or sensibility when it comes to your APIs. Some of it is because you are personally lacking in these areas, part of it is because you have no diversity on your team, but it is mostly because you all are just doing this to make money. As creative as you think doing a startups is, they are really just about making money for your bosses, and investors–not a lot of imagination, creativity, or sensibility is required.</p>

<p>You could invest the time to come up with good ideas for applications and stories on your blog, but you really don’t want to do the work, or even stand out in the group. It is much easier to just phone it in, follow the group, and let your bosses and the existing industry trends dictate what you do each day. If the business sector you operate within is doing it, you are doing it. If you see something funny online or at a conference you will do it. You have a handful of blogs you read each weekend, that you will rewrite the best posts from and publish on your own blog. Your Twitter account is just retweeting what you find, and you don’t even push out your own stories, because you have already tweeted out the story you copied in the first place.</p>

<p>Don’t beat yourself up about this, you come by it honestly. Your privilege affords you never really getting out of your comfort zone, and the people around you make you feel good enough. Everyone on  your team is the same, and your bosses really don’t care, as long as you are just creating content, and sending out all the required signals. Just make it look like you are always busy, and keep all the channels active. You don’t actually have to support your API consumers, just make sure you are having conversations with them on forums, and the channels your boss can keep an eye on. Doing too much will make you a target. Keep an eye on your coworkers and never do anymore than they are, establishing a kind of solidarity of mediocrity. This isn’t rocket surgery, its API theater.</p>

<p>You know deep down that you have some creativity in there, but it is something that has never been encouraged. This is the damaging effects of your privileged world. Your parents, teachers, bosses, and friends never push you, and neither do you. You don’t have to. If this story pisses you off, you really have nobody to blame. You’ve never had to work hard. You have never pushed yourself to do any of the hard work required to fail, on the path to becoming creative, developing your sensibility, and honing your imagination. How are you ever going to know what you are capable of if you do not put yourself out there. Creativity isn’t created in a silo. People aren’t just born with sensibility. And API aren’t lacking in imagination by default. There are many APIs operating out there that possess all these characteristics, and are leading the conversation–why aren’t you one of them?</p>

<p>Your API service is the next big thing. It is something that every API provider will be needing, and you are confident it will be something that makes the API management space look like a momentary trend. You have a SaaS, as well as an open source edition, and have invested thousands of hours into your website, documentation, and you even have an API. Everything is CI/CD ready, and you speak fluent OpenAPI. You have all the bases covered, and adoption with the first wave of users has been great, and the sales numbers are meeting all the project. There is just one thing, you haven’t invested anything into the educational resources for your customers, and the companies they work for.</p>

<p>After a year of operation you are so confident in your team, and the services and tools you have, you feel like this is a sure thing. You’ve sold to all your startup friends, and have trended well on Product Hunt and Hacker News, and you see organic discussions about how your services are essential. Your API service provider startup is now ready for primetime, you are expand beyond the west coast, and begin targeting a handful of verticals in a couple of the biggest markets. Your research tells you that these industries are struggling with their APIs, and what you have is the solution to their pain–this is gonna be easy!</p>

<p>Six months later, your new user numbers are still growing, but active users have declined. Nobody is using your tool after the free trial period. You’ve hired armies of sales guys to go out and push, and come back with more information about what is happening. The number one thing you hear is that people just don’t get it. Not only do they not understand why your tools and services are valuable, they really don’t speak the same language when it comes to the API providers you are used to selling to. The groups you have worked with so far just get it, and they see the value to their mature API operations. The new businesses you’ve been targeting barely know what an HTTP status code is, and just aren’t that interested in CI/CD, microservices, GraphQL, or any of the other buzzwords you are used to pushing.</p>

<p>The companies you have in the funnel right now all have API programs, but they just aren’t that API literate and aware. They are just getting by, doing a mix of web services and web APIs, with traditional database connections, FTP dumps, and whatever else it takes to get thing done. They don’t understand the web, anything API, are lucky if they can go a week without sever outage or hiccup, let alone continuously integrate or deploy anything. You didn’t budget for this. Hell, you didn’t budget for educating users about anything, let alone playing catch up at this scale. These developers don’t get API at all, and without a base level of awareness, they can’t see where your tools and services fit into the big picture.</p>

<p>You’ve taken this intel back to your boss, but he doesn’t care. You obviously aren’t selling hard enough. Push harder to get them to sign a contract. Tell them whatever they want to hear to get them signed on. There is no budget for playing schoolteacher. This isn’t grade school. It isn’t your problem that they are so API illiterate. After another six months of this it is clear you are about to replaced with someone who will get the job done. Your lack of planning and investment in the area of education regarding not just your product, but also how a modern application and API lifecycle works will be the end of at least your job. Don’t worry though, in another 12 months it will be the end of the API service provider startup you work for as well. The world just wasn’t ready for your amazing API tools and services.</p>

<p>Just admit it, you could care less about your API consumers. You are just playing this whole API game because you read somewhere that this is what everyone should be doing now. You figured you can get some good press out of doing an API, get some free work from developers, and look like you are one of the cool kids for a while. You do the song and dance well, you have developed and deployed an API. It will look like the other APIs out there, but when it comes to supporting developers, or actually investing in the community, you really aren’t that interested in rolling up your sleeves and making a difference. You just don’t really care that much, as long as it looks like you are playing the API game.</p>

<p>Honestly, you’d do any trend that comes along, but this one has so many perks you couldn’t ignore it. Not only do you get to be API cool, you did all the right things, launched on Product Hunt, and you have a presence at all the right tech events. Developers are lining up to build applications, and are willing to work for free. Most of the apps that get built are worthless, but the SDKs you provide act as a vacuum for data. You’ve managed to double your budget by selling the data you acquire to your partners, and other data brokers. You could give away your API for free, and still make a killing, but hell, you have to keep charging just so you look legit, and don’t raise any alarm bells.</p>

<p>It is hard to respect developers who line up and work for free like this. And the users, they are so damn clueless regarding what is going on, they’ll hand over their address book and location in real-time without ever thinking twice. This is just to easy. APIs are such a great racket. You really don’t have to do anything but blog everyone once in a while, show up at events and drink beer, and make sure the API doesn’t break. What a sweet gig huh? No, not really, you are just a pretty sad excuse of a person, and it will catch up with you somewhere. You really represent everything wrong with technology right now, and are contributing to the world being a worse place than it already is–nice job!</p>

<p>A growing number of SMBs, SMEs, and other institutions, organizations, and government agencies are launching APIs, but the age APIs as the core product will thin, and those that do emerge and operate independently will be increasingly absorbed into the cloud platforms they operate on. The tractor beam of AWS, Google, and Azure are becoming to strong for us API providers to resit. We use their platforms to deploy and manage our APIs, we’ve ceded control over our operations to their clouds, it is just a matter of time before each of the APIs we depend on are assimilated into the cloud machine.</p>

<p>Sure, we’ll still get access to valuable resources that we couldn’t launch ourselves, things like Google Maps, and resources at scale like Amazon EC2. But our platforms will be closely watching our trajectories and they will make the calculating decision whether what we are doing is valuable enough to acquire, or just suffocate by launching a competitive service. Whoops, sorry! What you are doing is a great idea, but you will have three choices, don’t do it, sell to us, or we’ll drive you out of business. The open landscape of APIs will become thousands of cloud APIs that feel like we have an unlimited amount of resources, but in reality it will just limit and control available resources, allowing the cloud bigcos to steer the space wherever they want to–controlling the creation and distribution of ideas.</p>

<p>It was fun while it lasted. We were able to work on our own farms for a while, and use each others free range organic API resources, but pretty soon it will just be the factory model of API consumption. Sure, prices will be low when the cloud giants are doing battle, but when they aren’t we’ll be paying a premium for simple resources. When any newcomer emerges looking to disrupt any area of the API space they’ll be quickly consumed, suffocated, and silenced, removing any threat. Think of the broadband access in the United States currently, that is what API consumption will look like in 20 years. There will be no options, no diversity, and we’ll be slaves to the bigcos. We will look back at the cloud period of APIs and regret that we ever gave them so much power.</p>

        <span class="post-date">31 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/algo-rotoscope/stories/36349148770_1a9d2692b2_z.jpg" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>People love to point out that APIs are unreliable. You can’t depend on them. They go away at any point, and they just aren’t something you want to be building your business on top of. When in reality APIs aren’t reliable it is the business, people, and investment behind them. The reality of the startup game is that us API consumers aren’t actually the customer, we are just numbers in a larger game where startup founders and their investors are looking for enterprise customers to purchase their startup getting the desired exit. The API is just about attracting consumers, who will do the legwork to bring in users, adding to the value of a company.</p>

<p>As the startup funding landscape continues to dry up, shift, and evolve towards <a href="https://www.icoalert.com/">more riskier and volatile versions of investment like ICO</a>s, things are only going to get worse. Of course, few conversation will place the blame on the people and companies behind, but APIs will continue to be the scapegoat for the instability. It works just like the robots coming for your jobs. You never hear that rich people who own companies, that are making decisions to replace workers with robots are coming for your jobs. Its the robots. Technology in many forms makes for a great blame shield, absorbing the responsibility for the volatility, instability, and scams that are going on across the landscape.</p>

<p>In reality, nothing much changes for us API consumers. You need to get to know your API providers, well as the company and people behind them. Study their approach to operating their API. Do they communicate? Do they have proper support? Do they communicate their uptime status? What type of funding is propping them up, and the shape of their business model use. Make sure you always have a plan B if you can, and do not trust that ANY API will be around forever. If possible, come up with failover plans, and run drills with your team regarding what will happen when APIs fail, become unreliable, or go away entirely. Ultimately it is up to you to determine the impact unreliable APIs will have on your APIs. We can blame API providers, startups, and VCs as much as we want, but it is entirely up to us to help stabilize the API space for our users.</p>

<p>Investment, fundraising, and chasing exits will be the #1 area of instability for the API space. After that it will be the network, ranging from network neutrality going away to lack of investment in capacity and security. While the growth in the number of companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies doing APIs will keep things on forward trajectory, the reputation of APIs will continue to take a hit when it comes to the stories people tell about who is to blame. APIs are the frontline for almost everything occurring online these days, and this will make it the first place everyone will be pointing the finger. It is up to us in the API community to keep telling stories putting the blame where it is deserved. If we are not telling stories, the other side will, and they’ll be firing up the pundits, continuing to let irresponsible API startups get away with their bullshit games.</p>

<p>We tend to look at APIs as something we opt into. As an API consumer we choose to integrate with these external APIs. We made a conscious decision to put an API to work. We navigate our way to their API portals, learn about an API from its documentation, and take back what we know along with a handful of URIs, and bake the APIs into our internal systems and applications. When in reality we are just worker bees sent to find pollen, and bring the pollen back to the hive, unaware that the pollen contains an invasive species, and rarely do we ever think too deeply about why we are doing all of this–just following orders.</p>

<p>We are told by our coworkers, the tech blogosphere, and by API providers that we need these things. Often times we are enticed with dreams of striking it rich, and that we are mining a platform for its riches, but really we are being mined by the platform, making it richer. Facebook, Twitter, Uber, Google, and other platforms want us to think APIs are democratizing, and that we are being empowered. There is always light at the end of the tunnel for the free labor we do as API consumers, and application developers. Along this journey, rarely do we realize the data we giving away, the free labor we’ve offered up without ever being asked, and how we’ve done the heavy lifting for this invasive, disruptive species we’ve invited into our lives. Once embedded, this species is surveilling, extracting, and taking what it needs, only giving back what it needs to keep its host alive.</p>

<p>We’ve been tricked by the API mirror. We look at it and see ourselves, and listen to the stories and myths that we tell ourselves, as we read they hype in the tech blogosphere, and on the Redditz and Githubz. We seek out the machine, do the work to integrate it into our lives, then we evangelize it’s spread to our friends, neighbors, and clients. It doesn’t matter how the host machine morphs, changes, acquires, evolves, and deprecates. We keep doing the work. We keep inviting more of the  invasive species into our homes. As we convince our application users to invite the invasive species into their lives, at first it was just one, now it’s hundreds, and next year it will be thousands of them, infecting every corner of our personal and professional existence. When will we stop and ask ourselves if this is worth it? When will we stop doing the work for them, and realize where this is all leading? The invasive species are only growing stronger, and consolidating, eventually we won’t be able to say no, we will be forced to do their bidding, and let them have their way in our homes, businesses, and public space.</p>

<p>I get regular emails from folks telling me how much they love what I do, then asking me to work for free. I’m totally happy for folks to inform me about their company, products, case studies, and other API goings on with their company. This is the bread and butter for my storytelling on API Evangelist–please keep it coming. However, the folks who ask me to work for free, what are you thinking? Where does this ethic come from in the tech sector, where folks expect you to work for their startup for free? It is something that has  really gotten to ridiculous levels.</p>

<p>Join our webinar. Write a story for our blog. Contribute to a white paper. Join our podcast. Speak at our event. Teach a workshop. Come visit our company. Talk about our products and services. Help us craft our strategy. Do some research on this subject so we can use it. Tell us what we are doing wrong. Download, install, and play with our tool, and provide us with feedback.

Vote us up on Hacker News. Commit to our open source project. Help us create an API definition. Can you review this project specification. On, and on, and on. Oh, and hey I just wanted to email you again, because you didn’t respond to the last two emails!</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong. If you know me, and we have history, feel free to ask me for favors, but remember, I do not have a job. I’m happy to help my friends, and love participating in podcasts with smart people, and reviewing my friends writing, because they scratch my back. They throw me bones, and have a history of given me exposure, and paying me for actual work. However, if we do not know each other, and have never talked, why on earth would you be asking me to work for free? Why would I want to take my brand that I’ve invested in building for seven years, and transfer that value to you for nothing? I don’t know you, your company, or anything about the value you deliver. I have to make a living just like you, and I can’t be working for free, or there would be nothing of value for both of us.</p>

<p>I know many of you are excited by the seemingly constant forward motion of the tech space, and that you might not realize that you are being rude. You may not be able to see it because you are in the middle of it, but much of startup culture is built on exploitation of others, and just because you are willing to be exploited by your investors, and those around you doesn’t mean you should expect others to fall in line. I’m a professional, and I’m happy to share my knowledge of the space, but it means you need to meet me halfway, and strike a business deal with me. This means emailing, DM’ing, and contacting me in a way that sets that table, not just expecting I will work for free. I appreciate your excitement, but please respect my time, and all the work I’ve put into my business, and I’ll do the same for you.</p>

<p>I’m really honored that some of my partners are kind enough to offer me a piece of the action in their companies, in exchange for what I do. I really am. However, going forward I’m going to have to decline any stock options in exchange for work, or advising, because it really doesn’t pencil out for me. I know it is the currency you are working with, getting investment in exchange for options, and trying to get knowledge, talent, and other forms of investment in exchange as well. I trust it will work out in your favor, but from my vantage point, there really is no upside in the game.</p>

<p>I regularly receive accusations of having and agenda because of real or perceived interest in companies, so with this hit on my brand, and the lack of return from the historic stock options I’ve had historically, it just doesn’t work out. My last advisor options netted me $319, for about 60 hours of work on, and travel costs out of my own pocket. I’m sure if I had more capital investment, and a bigger piece of the action, I’d fare better, but for the stake I get thrown–it just doesn’t do it for me. Plus, I have a manila folder in the filing cabinet of more significant shares that aren’t worth the paper they are printed on, so stock options really doesn’t float my boat in the first place.</p>

<p>Please don’t let this hurt your feelings. I know you are heavily invested in the value of your options, but I’m just not there. I’m happy to find other arrangements to make things happen, but with the way that stock options get wielded against me, and used to potentially discredit what I’m doing, it just isn’t worth anymore. As it stands today I only have stake in a single company–<a href="https://skylight.digital/">Skylight Digital</a> (5%). I have NO stake in any API related company, and I am going to keep it that way. I’m not 100% against an equity stake, but the risk of low stake investments, and the high risk of damage to my brand leaves me extremely critical about any conversation in this area.</p>

<p>It is another fascinating area of the startup game in my view, where people like punching down, instead of up when it comes to questioning the ethics and credibility folks in the API space. People be all questioning my ethics, but afraid to ever go after startups, or investors, because it might hurt their chances to be invited into the club some day! It’s a crazy financing reality in the API space, where up is down, and down is up, and I’m just beating that API Evangelist drum. #onward</p>

        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/photos/36609070321_c7122be05f_z.jpg" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I am the first to admit that I suck at the money game. I just don’t care. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve made a significant amount of money in my career, and command a phat six figure salary when I’ve done the job thingy, and I don’t have a problem asking for a decent rate when I’m consulting. It is just that I don’t care about climbing the money ladder, because I realized in my early 20s that it was never enough. I’ve had business partners run off with hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, screw me out of the equity in multiple companies, and I’ve experienced what people will do to get at that next rung of the ladder. I quickly saw that you are never happier with each rung you climb, and often times you end up much unhappier the higher up you go–which is why I stay where I am at.</p>

<p>If you have been one of my partners you know I suck at invoicing regularly. Honestly, I don’t think about it until I have to. Which regularly I forget an entire month. Unless I’m looking looking at eviction, or have something I need to purchase, I’m more obsessed with working. I love what I do (mostly), and if someone would just drop money in my account each month, I just keep beating the API Evangelist drum, and never look to make beyond what it takes to keep me going each month. Being independent is a hustle, and it takes the support of my partners (thanks 3Scale, Runscope, Restlet, and Tyk) to make this work, along with some side consulting hustle to fill in the gaps. I mostly prefer the low monthly sponsorship money because the consulting hustle is a chore, and chasing down the money can be a full time job. I’d say 1/3 of the time its about getting plugged into corporate system(s), 1/3 of the time smooth sailing, and 1/3 of the time I’m getting screwed.</p>

<p>Honestly, the companies who want an NDA, contract, and all the trimmings are the ones I’ll usually walk away from. When I have a contract, I almost always get screwed over. I have more unpaid contracts from more well known corporations and startups than I can shake a stick at. I’m amazed at the folks who talk me up, tell me how much they love what I do, and want my services…then get what they need, don’t pay their invoice, and go radio silent. I also get many folks who tell me how their API budget wasn’t as big as they had hoped this quarter, and my fees would be such a big hit. Another I hear regularly is startups waiting for their investment, and at some point they’ll kick me down when they get theirs. The space is full of excuses regarding how hard-done-by everyone is with their operating budgets, runway, and what not. Yeah, I know what you mean–your hard times means I won’t make rent this month. I get it. I do.</p>

<p>This is all a game. The only difference is I’m admitting it, and you aren’t. I feel like we are all in this together, trying to build community, and you are secretively in it for yourself, and working it from every angle. Don’t worry, I know not all of you are like this, and when I’m done with API rant week, I’ll showcase some of the heroes in my world (you know who you are). I just wanted to take the time to shame some of you for the greedy, inconsiderate individuals you are, playing a nice game on the front, but making sure you always get yours. The differences is that you’ll have a rough time in the next meeting, and I’ll be out of my apartment, unable to make it to my next consulting gig, or just unable to meet my wider personal and professional obligations. But it’s cool, I’m sure you got this all figured out, and you will sleep well at night. It’s just business.</p>

<p>I spend a lot of time defending my space as the API Evangelist. I’ve had lengthy battles with folks in the comments of my blog for defending women, charging for my services, being pay for play, having secret agendas, and much more. I’ve had my site taken down a handful of times (before I made static on Github Pages), because I stood up for my girlfriend, or just joined in on the wrong (right) cause. When you have been doing this as long as you have, you see the size of the armies of tech bros that are out there, waiting to pounce. It is why I don’t share links to Reddit or Hacker News anymore. I stopped sharing to DZone for same reason, but they’ve since cleaned up their community, brought in some great talent (including women), and I’ve started syndicating there again.</p>

<p>Most recently I had someone accuse me of pay for play, even though there was no disclosure statement present, and I have had two other folks accuse me of having an agenda set forth by my partners. If you know me, you understand how ridiculous this is, but this never stops the waves of young men finding their way to my site, and pointing the finger. What I find fascinating about this is these men never point the finger at Techcrunch, or call out API startups (and bigcos) for colluding, sponsoring, pay for play, and the other bullshittery that goes on. They go after folks who are outspoken against the machine, and never after the machine itself. If people don’t like something I said, or what someone I’m writing about is up to, they tend to go after me, without spending any time getting to know me, looking at my background, or looking at the seven years of storytelling on my site–<a href="http://apievangelist.com/archive/">there is a single page to do it</a>!</p>

<p>The majority of these folks rarely ever have their own blog, name and pictures on their Twitter or Github accounts, and have a minimum digital footprint. They don’t understand what it is like to be out in the public sphere sharing their ideas on a daily basis, and prefer hiding behind anonymity while they go after the little guy. Again, rarely do you see them going after the Silicon Valley, or larger corporate machine–too big of target. I have special Twitter lists I add these folks too, and usually when one of them pisses in my Cheerios I’ll spend some time seeing what the others are up to, and most times it is more of the same. Trolls. It is easy to dismiss these folks as part of the wider illness we see infecting the Internet, but much like sexism and racism, the real damage is done by the waves of complicit individuals and platforms who support them, chime in, pile on, and maintain an environment where this type of behavior is normalized.</p>

<p>For the most part I’m a diplomat. I tend to perform API Evangelist in a supportive, friendly tone. I started API Evangelist on this tone with intent. I saw the meanness in the space, fully grasped my assholeness as a VP of technology within an enterprise group, and wanted to do something different, and help people feel like APIs were approachable and friendly. I still support this tone, but this week, I’m performing a more offensive version of API Evangelist. One that is calling y’all out for the bullshit that you do each day online in this business, or condone and support daily in your complacency. I’m not really as unhinged as these posts make me out to be (close), I’m just exploring the illness that is rampant in the space, and pushing back a little. There is a significant amount of cover afforded to VCs, bigcos, and the startups who support their message, and for the handful of us out in the open, we often become a much easier target, when in reality there should be much more accountability for those that are responsible for the illnesses in the tech sector, ad are often out of site, but actually have their hands on the puppet strings that make things go around.</p>

        <span class="post-date">29 Aug 2017</span>

<p>You are full steam ahead with your microservices campaign. You’ve read <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html">Martin Fowlers blog post</a>, and talked about the topic with your team for the last six months. After a couple pilot projects, you are diving in, and have started decoupling the monolith of systems that you depend on to operate your business each day. You have mapped out all the technical details of all code, and backend systems in play, and have targeted about 30% of existing systems for reworking using a microservices strategy. Yet, despite all your planning, your microservices effort will still fail just like your API efforts, and its predecessor the SOA initiative did.</p>

<p>Despite all your research, planning, and eye for the technical detail in about 7 months everything will begin to slow, and by month 10 you will begin to get very, very frustrated. You see, you haven’t included any of the human element in your planning. You have thought about the business, cultural, legal, financial, and other non-technical aspects of operating your systems. You’ve done a fine job of developing a strategy for decoupling your monolith database, but you haven’t invested any time in what it will take to educate and bring up to speed all the business users, support, QA, and other folks you will need to have up to speed to actually make all this work. You are so blinded by technological trends, you forget to spend time talking to the people.</p>

<p>You are feeling good right now because you have surrounded yourself with yes men. People who are in perfect alignment with what you are doing. They think like you, and have drank the same kool-aid. However, once you start implementing your grand strategy to make every smaller, more micro, you will begin to see friction. Sales folks will begin to see you as a threat as you fragment their landscape, and be seen as taking a piece of their action. Business users will begin to freak out, because while they had to battle with IT before to get access to resources, now they have deal with man many smaller teams, with even more unfriendly people to talk with–you just increased the scope of what they need to know. Many will see your work as just increasing complexity, and expanding the landscape of their work, in an already hectic world. As this perception increases they will find ways to throw a monkey wrench into your finely tuned plan.</p>

<p>Your SOA rollout failed because it was to heavy handed, dictated everything, giving vendors too strong of a voice, while also strengthening IT too much in the eyes of business groups. Your API efforts underestimated the fatigue management and businesses users experience from SOA, and your team never really believed in API anyways–they just thought it was a fad, trend, and pipe dream. Now your team is sold on it being all about offering up smaller services, and you are paying lip service to fact that “service” should be including more than just the technical, but you actually haven’t done the heavy lifting. You don’t have your training, support, documentation, QA, testing, discovery, terms of service, security and other critical aspects of each service in place, let alone the comprehensive view of how this works across the thousands of microservices you are planning. Let’s get real, your microservices plan will fail just like API, and SOA. You are just too in love with the technical, and willfully blind to the human side of all of this to ever make it work.</p>

        <span class="post-date">29 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/algorotoscope/stories/36575484422_087495fca9_z.jpg" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>You just got three separate calls, and countless emails alerting to the fact that you just had a major security breach. You don’t know the extent of the damage yet, but it looks like they got into your primary customer database via the APIs you depend on for all your mobile applications. You are sitting in your office chair, sweating, and trying to figure out how this happened. I will tell you, it is because you have done nothing. You have de-prioritized security at every turn, resulting in an open door for any hacker to walk through.</p>

<p>Not only have you done nothing, you actually worked against anyone who brought up the topic of API security. You would respond: We don’t have the time. We don’t have the budget. We don’t have the skills. You never listened to anyone of your staff, even that security lady (what was her name?) you had hired last year, and then resigned, with a letter containing over 25 security holes she had been trying to take care of, but because of the toxic environment you’ve created, she was unable to do anything and moved on. You have created an environment where anyone who brings up security concerns feels persecuted, and even that their job is in jeopardy, making “doing nothing” the standard mode across all operations.</p>

<p>You have eight separate mobile applications which all use APIs, and all of them using the customer database in question, which also stores credit cards, which is in violation of your PCI compliance–you know, those forms you sign off on each year? You felt these mobile APIs were secure because they were hidden behind your mobile applications, and your developers had given you a application security scan report last year. In this situation you would love to blame these developers, but all roads lead to you when it comes to responsibility for this situation. You begin to feel sick to your stomach thinking about the 345,633 credit cards and other PII that was leaked. You know the numbers, because you have real time reports on how many customers you have. You just don’t have any real time reports for anything to do with security.</p>

<p>API security was everyones first concern when you first pitched these projects starting back in 2010, and you have managed to run for seven years without any major incidents. Each year you have just been more emboldened in your do nothing strategy, but everything has caught up with you now. What do you do? You don’t have a breach action plan. You don’t have sort of protocol for this type of situation, despite saying that you did several times in meetings. You better get to work dealing with the technical fallout from all of this, because it will last weeks, if not months. Then you get to also start dealing with the business, legal, and political fallout from this breach. Hey, there is a bright spot. The chances are pretty high you might not even have a job after all of this is pretty high as well. Enjoy!</p>

<p>You are in a sweet spot. You got a fat six figure job in the coolest department of your company, building out your API platform. You have a decent budget (never as much as you want) to throw hackathons, run Google and Twitter ads, and you can buy schwag to give away at your events. Sure there is a lot of pressure to deliver, but you are doing pretty well. All you gotta do is convince 3rd party developers to do thing with your companies APIs, develop web, mobile, voice, and other applications that generate buzz and deliver the return on investment your bosses are looking for.</p>

<p>It is all about you and your team. Let’s get to work growth hacking! Attract as may new users as we can, and convince them to build as much as we possibly can. Let’s get them to develop SDKs, write articles for us on their blog, speak at our events, favorite things on hacker news, and whatever activities that we can. Your objective is to extract as much value from your API operations as you possibly can, and give nothing back. Expect developers to work for free. Expect your hackathons attendees to come up with the next great idea, build it, and hand it over to you for very little in return. This isn’t a partnership, this is an API ecosystem, and your team is determined to win at all costs.</p>

<p>Your API isn’t a two-way street. All roads lead to your success, and your bosses getting what they want. You don’t care that 3rd party developers should be compensated, or that they have any rights to their intellectual property. The 5% of them that successfully build applications, we will offer them a job in exchange for it, or we’ll just replicate it internally, decrease their rate limits, and increase their error rates so that they can’t compete. Sure you want people to still feel inspired, but not enough so that they’ll ever be able to sustain their applications–the only sustainable application around here will be owned by the platform. After all, this is all just business–it is nothing personal.</p>

<p>I know that many of you are insecure about your APIs. You aren’t transparent with your numbers, and many aspects of your API operations. You are stressed out because you built it, and nobody came. You were able to artificially inflate your new user numbers, and API calls through paid campaigns, and bot activity, but nobody is using it, and you just can’t figure out why. You are asking yourself why don’t anyone see the value your API brings to the table? Why aren’t you getting the traction you thought you would get when you first came up with the idea?</p>

<p>You aren’t getting any traction with your API because it sucks. It was a bad idea. Nobody wants it. It sucks because it doesn’t provide any value in a highly competitive space, and you naively thought that if you built it everyone would come. You probably have a number of people around you telling you that your idea is great, and the API will be a hit. You’ve probably had this most of your life, and are used to people telling you that your ideas are great. It is why you feel so uncomfortable around anyone that is critical, because you just aren’t used to being told you that your ideas are dumb. It hurts your feelings.</p>

<p>This is why you surround yourself with people who look, act and think like you do. It is why you don’t think women and people of color have the skills needed to work on your dumb, useless ideas. You don’t have the balls to surround yourself with anyone who doesn’t think like you. If you did, you might have been told early on that your idea wasn’t worthwhile, or you might have gotten additional feedback or criticism that would have helped shape it into something useful. I know this is hard for you to hear, and you think you are really smart, and you probably read one of my cheerleader blog posts about how great APIs are, but in reality, if it doesn’t have any use in the real world nobody will care.</p>

<p>Don’t make this mistake with your API. Make sure your API team is as diverse as possible, and then work hard to make sure your community also becomes as inclusive you can. It is a lot more work to do thing this way, but it will pay off, and it will save you from potentially launching an API that completely sucks like this again, and doesn’t have any reach beyond just the echo chamber you exist in.</p>

<p>You hear a lot of discussion regarding public API vs private API. From my vantage point there is only web APIs that use public DNS, but I find that folks hung up on the separation usually have many other hangups about things they like to keep behind the firewall, and under the umbrella of private. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/08/10/my-focus-on-public-apis-applies-internally-as-well/">These are usually the same folks who like to tell me that my public API stories don’t apply to them</a>, and when you engage these folks in any ongoing fashion you tend to find that they are looking to keep a whole lot of dysfunction out of view from the public, and all the talk really has very little to do with APIs.</p>

<p>I spend my days studying the best practices across the leading API providers, and understanding what is working and what is not working when it comes to operating APIs. I have seven years of research I’m happy to share with folks, and I entertain a number requests to jump on calls, participate in webinars, do hangouts, and go onsite to do workshops and talks. I’m usually happy to do these things, and when it is a government agency, non-profit organization, and sometimes higher educational institutions, I am happy to these things at no charge. I like sharing what I know, and letting folks decide what they can use from the knowledge I’ve aggregated.</p>

<p>When I engage with folks I expect folks to not always be trusted–they don’t know me. However, I’m always surprised when folks think I have an agenda, looking to change them too fast, that I’m trying to shove something down their throat, and disrupt their position. First, I am always being invited in. I’m not a sales guy. I do not have anything to sell you except for my knowledge (which revenue goes to just goes back into doing what I do). There is regularly the quiet IT person who has carefully defended their position in the company and what they do not know for years, telling me this is all horse shit, and who do I think I am. Or the administrator who is always running around with their head cut-off, and feels the need to tell me that I do not understand them, and there is no way that any knowledge that I have is at all applicable to them–what the hell am I even doing here?</p>

<p>Hey, I’m just looking to share. If you don’t want it, I’m happy to tell me stories elsewhere, you don’t have to jump my shit. I’m genuinely trying to help, and share stories about what is working in other situations. I’m not looking to take your job, or make you do things you don’t have time or capacity for. Your dysfunction is not my API problem. I’m guessing this dysfunction is probably why you don’t have any sort of public API presence, and why your existing internal and partner APIs are not everything you’d like them to be. I am just going to quietly pick up my things and go back to what I was doing, I’m sorry that I’ve disrupted your chaotic world, and took up your time. I most likely won’t be back, but if you ever need to learn anything about APIs, and need a break, you know where to find me.</p>

<p>I know many of you read my blog for the valuable nuggets of information extracted from my regular research into the world of APIs. I spend a great deal of time sifting through very boring, mundane, and sometimes valuable API related goings on. I have managed to muster the energy each week for the last seven years to sift through thousands of feeds, Tweets, and Github repositories looking for nuggets of API wisdom, best practices, and sometimes bad practices, to share here on the blog. Some weeks I find this an easy task, something I really enjoy the process, but most weeks it is a chore–some weeks I don’t give a shit at all. This is one of those weeks. Well, last week was too, but instead of NO blog posts, this week I’m going to shift things up so that I can get on track.</p>

<p>I have had series of folks piss in my Cheerios lately, regarding the free and unpaid work that I do, and as a result, I find myself without any writing mojo for the second week in a row, and not caring about sifting through all your API startup blah blah blah. 1/3 is about being rude and bro assholes, 1/3 of it is that APIs are boring and y’all have no imagination, and 1/3 of it is I’m a mentally ill asshole. The result of all of this is that you get a week full of API rants, instead of API research. Sooooooo, if this side of my personality turns you off, I recommend you tuning out API Evangelist for at least a week, until I feel better, and find the energy to do what it is that I do. There will still be plenty of substance in my posts, and things will still be VERY API related, and something that you can apply in your regular work, I will just be taking off all filters, and it will be written directly from my brain instead of my API research.</p>

<p>I work really hard doing what I do. I work seven days a week, with no regular paycheck or institutional support. I do make a decent living from partners who step up to support me (and pay their bills), but it is a hustle to keep doing what I do. It always grinds on me when folks with good jobs attack me like I have some sort of agenda in their game, or the no name bros come out of the wood work to question my credibility when they know nothing about me. I spend a lot of time filtering out what I’m really thinking, sticking to the facts, helping make my nuggets of API research wisdom more digestible, but this week ain’t one of them, so hold on. Once I feel better, I will go back to normal, and make sure I point out the good that is going on in the space, but in the current mode y’all ain’t worth it, and I’m going to unload and rant for the next 30 or 40 posts. Normally I’d keep this kind of stuff just on kinlane.com, but since it will all be API focused, I’m going to give you the uncensored version here on apievangelist.com. Enjoy!</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Aug 2017</span>

<p>This API operations consideration won’t apply to every API, but for APIs that provide essential resources in a time of need, I wanted to highlight an API rate limit cry for help that came across my desk this weekend. <a href="https://twitter.com/Pinboard/status/901658084002713600">Our friend over at Pinboard alerted me</a> to someone in Texas asking for some help in getting Google to increase the Google Maps API rate limits for an app they were depending on as Hurricane Harvey:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey <a href="https://twitter.com/Google">@google</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/googlemaps">@googlemaps</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/GoogleMapsAPI">@googlemapsapi</a> can you please remove the limit on api access for <a href="https://twitter.com/ATXfloods">@atxfloods</a>? This is an emergency and we rely on it.</p>&mdash; Jen Savage (@savagejen) <a href="https://twitter.com/savagejen/status/901656342213033984">August 27, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The app they depended on had ceased working and was showing a Google Maps API rate limit error, and they were trying to get the attention of Google to help increase usage limits. As Pinboard points out, it would be nice if Google had more direct support channels to make requests like this, but it would be also great if API providers were monitoring API usage, aware of applications serving geographic locations being impacted, and would relax API rate limiting on their own. There are many reasons API providers leverage their API management infrastructure to make rate limit exceptions and natural disasters seems like it should be top of the list.</p>

<p>I don’t think API providers are being malicious with rate limits in this area. I just think it is yet another area where technologists are blind to the way technology is making an impact (positive or negative) on the world around us. Staying in tune to the needs of applications that help people in their time of need seems like it will have to components, 1) knowing your applications (you should be doing this anyways) and identifying the ones that have a public service, and 2) staying in tune with natural and other disasters that are happening around the world. We see larger platforms like Facebook and Twitter rolling out permanent solutions to assist communities in their times of needs, and it seems like something that other smaller platforms should be tuning into as well.</p>

<p>Disaster support and considerations will be an area of API operations I’m going to consider adding into my research, and spending more time to identify best practices, and what platforms are doing to better serve communities in a time of need using APIs.</p>

<p>I found myself looped into another API patent situation. I’m going to write this up as I would any other patent story, then I will go deeper because of my deeper personal connection to this one, but I wanted to make sure I called this patent what it is, and what ALL API patents are–a bad idea. Today’s patent is for <a href="http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PG01&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=20170102925.PGNR.">an automatch process and system for software development kit for application programming interface</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Title: Automatch process and system for software development kit for application programming interface<br /><br />
Patent# : US 20170102925 A1<br /><br />
Abstract: A computer system and process is provided to generate computer programming code, such as in a Software Development Kit (SDK). The SDK generated allows an application to use a given API. An API description interface of the system is operable to receive API-description code describing one or more endpoints of the API. A template interface is operable to receive one or more templates of code defining classes and/or functions in a programming language which can be selected by the selection of a set of templates. A data store is operable to use a defined data structure to store records of API description code to provide a structured stored description of the API. A code generation module is operable to combine records of API with templates of code which are arranged in sets by the language of the code they contain. The combining of records and code from templates may use pointers to a data structure which is common to corresponding templates in different sets to allow templates of selected languages to be combined with any API description stored.<br /><br />

<p>If you have been in the API space for as long as I have you know that the generation of API SDKs using an API definition is not original or new, it is something that has been going on for quite some time, with many open source solutions available on the landscape. It is something everyone does, and there are many services and tooling available out there to deliver SDKs in a variety of languages for your API. It is something that just isn’t patent worthy (if there was such a thing anymore). It shouldn’t exist, and the authors should know better, and the US Patent Office should know better, but in the current digital environment we exist in there isn’t a lot of sensibility and logic when it comes to business in general, let alone intellectual property.</p>

<p>I haven’t pulled any patents as part of my <a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com/">API patent research</a> in some time, so this particular patent hasn’t come across my radar. I was alerted to the patent via a Tweetstorm, shared with me in Slack by Adeel (one of the authors of the patent):</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">3 years after <a href="https://twitter.com/SwaggerApi">@SwaggerApi</a> codegen goes OSS, <a href="https://twitter.com/APIMatic">@APIMatic</a> patents… swagger-codegen.

<p>In which my response was, “oh. ouch. well, gonna have to think on this one sir. I’ll let you know my response, but I’m going to guess you might not like how I feel either. I’m not pro-patent. let me simmer on it for a couple days and I’ll share my thoughts.”  As I was simmering I was pulled into the conversation again by Tony Tam:</p>

<p>I was taking my usual time, gathering my thoughts in my notebook. Taking walks. Simmering. Then I wake up Saturday morning to this Tweet:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-cards="hidden" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">That looks like a sponsored story to me (given the issues with apimatic generated code).

<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The comment did get me to Tweet a couple times, but ultimately I’m not going to engage or deviate from my initial response to gather my thoughts and write a more thoughtful post. The machine wants me to respond emotionally, fractionally, and in ways that can be taken out of context. This is how the technology space works, and keeps you serving it’s overlords–the money folks behind.</p>

<p>I do have to admit, when I first responded I was going to take a much harder line against APIMATIC, but after seeing the personal attacks on Adeel, his attempts to defend himself, then this no presence Twitter account coming at me personally, bringing into question that maybe I was being paid to write articles I changed the tone of this story significantly. The conversation around this patents shows what is wrong with the business and politics of APIs, more than anything API patents have done to the community to date.</p>

<p>First, Adeel doesn’t understand the entire concept of what Tony meant when he said patent, any more than he grasps what Tony meant by douchbag. This isn’t a jab at Adeel. It’s truth. Adeel is a Pakistani, living in New Zealand. I’ve spent the last couple of years engaging with him in person, and virtually via hangouts, Slack, and email. I’m regularly having to explain some very western concepts to him, and often find myself think deeply about what I’m saying to make sure I am bridging things properly. Not because Adeel isn’t smart (he’s exceptionally smart), it is just because of the cultural divide that exists between him and I.</p>

<p>Adeel didn’t file their patent out of some competitive ambition, or stealing of open source ideas as referenced in the Tweetstorm. He did it because it is what the academic environment where APIMATIC was born encouraged it, and it is something that is associated with smart ideas by the institution. This concept isn’t unique to New Zealand, it is something that still flourishes in the United States. Where the cultural bridge was necessary, is when it comes to why patents are bad. In these academic environments, you have a good idea, you patent it. It is something that historically acceptable, and encouraged. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/06/08/patents-as-a-measure-of-individual-success/">You see this across institutions and within enterprises around the globe, with patents as a measure of individual success</a>. Adeel and his team had a good idea, so they patented it, he didn’t think he was doing anything wrong.</p>

<p>Addeel isn’t being any more aggressive or vindictive <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/01/12/i-just-cannot-get-behind-api-patents-especially-when-they-apply-to-http-and-hypermedia/">than Sal or Matt were with their hypermedia patents</a>, or <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/25/the-unintended-consequences-of-api-patents/">Jon Moore</a> were with their patents. It is what their VCs, companies, and parent institutions encourage them to do with their good ideas (go after them and make your mark on the world). I fault all of these individuals just as much as I fault Adeel, or even Tony for that matter, when it comes to the name of an open source product suddenly becoming a trademarked product. Ironically this conversation is going up, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/08/22/thank-you-tony/">right after a post regarding how much I respect Tony for his work</a>, despite me be VERY upset about Swagger not remaining attached to an open source product we all had contributed so much to, and helped spread the word about. If we are worried about the sanctity of open source, we should be defending all dimensions of intellectual property. I know, not a perfect comparison, but I imagine Tony feels similar to what I did when this happened. Which I let him know via email, but have never gone after anyone individually, or personally, sicking my dogs on him, although I’m sure it might have felt that way.</p>

<p>All of this makes me think deeper about the relationship between open source and APIs. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/12/02/what-licensing-should-i-be-considering-when-i-take-open-source-software-and-offer-up-as-an-api/">What are the responsibilities of companies who wrap open source technology with an API and offer a commercial service?</a> How does licensing, trademarks, patents, and other intellectual property concerns need to be respected? I’m guessing I could go through many of the API patents in my research and find thatmost filings that did not consider or respect open source offerings that came before them. People had a good idea. They were in an environment that encourages patents, and they filed for a patent to show their idea was worthwhile–that USPTO stamp of approval is widely recognized as a way to acknowledge your idea is worthy.</p>

<p>I want to make clear. I am not defending patents. I am defending Adeel. I am doing so strongly, because of the no name person who decided to chime in and question the credibility of my API storytelling. Otherwise I would have laid things out, and told Adeel he needed to learn the lesson and move on. I just saw everyone piling on Adeel like he was a bad person, and some tech bro just patenting things to get the upper hand. I have known Adeel for years, and know that is not the situation. Once I started getting piled on as well, then it switched things into personal mode for me, and now I feel the need to defend my friend, but not his actions. The tech community loves to pile on, and I deal with wave after wave of tech bros who don’t read my work and accuse me of things that people who DO read my work would NEVER acuse me of. Adeel is my friend. Adeel is an extremely intelligent, honorable, kind-hearted person, and it pissed me off when people started piling on him.</p>

<p>Now that you understand my personal relationship, let’s address my business relationship. I am an advisor to APIMATIC. Not because I’m paid, or there are stock options, it is because he is my friend. In August (couple of weeks ago), Adeel and his investors had offered me a 0.25% share capital in the company but there has been no paperwork, nothing signed, and no deals made as of today. Honestly, after the $318 check I got for my latest advisory role, which I spent about 60 hours of work on, and travel costs out of my own pocket, I have little interest in pushing the conversations forward to the point where things ever get formalized. It just isn’t a priority for me, and damn sure has never influenced my writing about APIMATIC, let alone a story from June of 2015, like the Tweetstorm participant accused me of, without doing any due diligence on who I am. You are always welcome to ask ANY of my partners if I take money to write positive things about their products, or guest posts, you’ll get the same answer from all of them–it is something I get asked regularly, and just don’t give a shit about doing.</p>

<p>API patents are a bad idea. Patent #US 20170102925 A1, for an automatch process and system for software development kit for application programming interface is a bad idea. API patents are a bad idea because people think they are a sign of being smart when they are not. API patents are a bad idea because corporations, institutions, and organizations keep telling people it is a sign of being smart, and people believe it. API patents are a bad idea because the entire US Patent system is broken, because it is an intellectual property relic of a physical age, being leveraged in a digital realm where things are meant to be interoperable and reusable. API patents are bad idea because y’all keep doing them thinking they are a good idea, when they just open you up to being a tool that allows corporations to lock up ideas, and provide a vehicle for others to use them as leverage in a court of law, and behind closed doors negotiations. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/02/after-looking-through-23414-api-patents-i-think-it-will-just-come-down-to-who-litigates/">Ultimately whether or not patents are bad will come down to who litigates with their patent portfolios, and the patents they acquire</a>. The scariest part is most of this leveraging and strong-arming won’t always happen in a public court, it will happen behind closed doors in arbitration, and with venture capital negotiations.</p>

<p>Which really brings me to the absurdity of this latest patent Tweetstorm. I’m all for showcasing that patents are a bad idea, and even shaming companies and individuals for doing them. However, I saw this one get personal a couple of times, and even took a jab at me. Y’all really shouldn’t do this shit in glass houses, because patents are just part of your intellectual property problems. The NDAs y’all are signing are a bad idea. Those deals you are making with VCs are mostly bad ideas. Y’all are just as ignorant, or maybe in denial about the deals you are making as Adeel is about the negative impacts of the US patent system. Most of these deals you make will result in your startup being wielded in more damaging ways than Adeel’s patent ever will. Yet you keep doing startups, signing deals, and attacking your competition, and people like me just investing in the community. Adeel is currently reading about patents, which I regret to say won’t provide him with the answers he is looking for. There are few books on the subject. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=lawrence+lessig">Maybe reading something from Lawrence Lessig might get you part of the way there</a>. The real answers you are looking for come from experience, and that is what you just received. This was an easy lesson, just wait until APIMATIC acquired by a bigco, and see your patents wielded in ways you never imagined–those will be some harder lessons.</p>

<p>I don’t have a problem with calling out Adeel for APIMATIC’s patent–it is what should happen. I have a problem with him being called douchbag, and the other personal attacks, and assumptions on his (and my) character that occurred within the Tweetstorm. By all means, call him out on Twitter. By all means, educate him around the damage to OSS and API community by doing patents. Don’t make these things personal, assume malicious intent, and recklessly begin questioning the character of everyone involved. Also, if you are just spending your time calling out you competitors for this behavior, because it bothers you, and you don’t call out your partners, and the companies you work for, and the services you use for their abusive use of OSS and damaging intellectual property claims, you have significantly weakened your argument, and won’t always be able to count on me to jump into the discussion and have your back. I do this shit full time, with no financial backing, corporate or institutional cover. I’m out here full time, not hiding behind a Twitter handle, holding folks accountable whenever and wherever I can. If you are doing a startup, learn from this story. Educate your institutions, companies, and investors about how API patents are damaging everything we are doing, and never will actually demonstrate you have a novel idea, it is just locking up other ideas.</p>

<p>In the end, everything we know as API is already patented. <a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com/">Look through the thousands of API patents in my research</a>. Hell, <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/06/06/patent-api-descriptions/">Microsoft already has the patent on API definitions</a>, so what does it matter if there is a patent on generating SDKs from API definitions? Also, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/25/doing-the-research-in-preparation-for-my-patent-on-a-patent-api/">my patent on API patents is pending</a>, so it will all be game over then. Mwahahaha!! ;-) As Tony said, the patent system is broken. Let’s keep letting our companies, organizations, institutions, and most importantly the USPTO know that it is broken. Let’s keep calling out folks who still think API patents are a good idea (sorry Adeel), and schooling them on the why, but let’s not be dicks about it. Let’s not assume people have bad intentions. Let’s understand the history of patents and that many people are still taught that they are a sign of having good ideas and being what you do as part of regular business operations. Let’s just make sure we also lead by building a better API service or tooling, as Adeel brought up in his defense. Also, when he said this, he wasn’t making this an APIMATIC is better than Swagger Codegen (or others), he is just focused on making a better product in general. I’m sorry but he has. Y’all can focus on the merits of Swagger Codegen vs. APIMATIC, but what he’s done with the SDK docs, portal, and continuous integration, ARE great improvements. Much like the commercial service Swagger has become (ya know, the Swagger in Swagger Codegen) and evolved on top of the open source API specification and tooling Tony set into motion for ALL of us to build upon–thanks again Tony.</p>

<p>P.S. I wouldn’t have been so hard on Tony if I hadn’t been looped in to defend intellectual property and OSS like this.<br />
P.S.S. I wouldn’t have been so easy on Adeel, if no name McTwitter account had accused me of selling out when I don’t do that.<br />
P.S.S.S. Adeel, patents are bad because people use them in bad ways, and the US Patent Office is underfunded, understaffed, and can’t tell what is good or bad patents–this is the way bigcos want them.<br />
P.S.S.S.S. Sorry I’m such an asshole everyone, but I hope y’all are getting somewhat used to it after seven years.<br /></p>

<p>**Disclosure: **I am an advisor to APIMATIC (very proud of it)!</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/08/22/county-level-marijuana-regulation-in-california-using-apis/">County Level Marijuana Regulation In California Using APIs</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">22 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.ukiahdailyjournal.com/article/NP/20170810/NEWS/170819962"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/weed/mendocino-county-split-from-state-on-cannabis+track-and-trace.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p>Counties across the State of California are scrambling to get everything in order now that marijuana is legal, and <a href="http://www.ukiahdailyjournal.com/article/NP/20170810/NEWS/170819962">the 3rd party vendors working with the state are using an API to try and bridge the regulatory needs of each county,</a> as they look to regulate the brand new industry. It sounds like the marijuana regulatory API isn’t 100% ready for prime time, but it is interesting to hear that state is looking to “mitigate the burden of counties” when it comes to production of marijuana using APIs.</p>

<p>I have been curating news about APIs in use across the growing marijuana industry, but this is the fist story I’ve written on the subject. Now that I’m seeing APIs use as part of the regulatory engine for the industry, things are getting a little more real, and not just be about finding seeds, stores, and other industry data. I’ll keep scratching around to see what I can find out about the software vendors mentioned in the article, and see if I can get my hands on any documentation, or a link to any active portal. I’m curious to see where this marijuana regulatory API train is headed.</p>

<p>Since the marijuana industry is a completely new one for cities, counties, and states to manage, there is an opportunity to leverage new technology like APIs as part of the interactions between government entities, with the help of 3rd party providers. <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/05/05/taxation-on-public-data-via-the-api-management-layer/">Maybe there is even some opportunity for revenue generation on top of these APIs, allowing for government to fund the software development in a way that it could also be used across other government systems</a>. Push things forward with the rollout and expansion of the marijuana industry, and use that to fund other government systems that lack the funds, and are often years behind. The problems states face in working with counties doesn’t stop with this new marijuana industry, and there are so many other aspects of government operations that could benefit from APIs helping “mitigate the burden of counties” trying to comply with state laws and regulations.</p>

        <span class="post-date">22 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/blueprint"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/facebook/facebook-blueprint-screenshot.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p>I am preparing a training section of my API Evangelist research, and part of the process involves learning about what other API providers and API service providers are up to in this area. On my list to look through is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/blueprint">Facebook Blueprint</a>, their training area for the platform. The courses present there aren’t specifically for the Facebook API, and is targeting primarily business uses, but the approach translates to API focused training materials, and showcases what is a priority for Facebook when it comes to educating their platform consumers.</p>

<p>As part of my API training research I want to understand the building blocks employed by Facebook so that I can apply as part of my API Evangelist training efforts, and help other API providers and service providers apply as part of their operations as well. Here are a few of the API training building blocks I found present:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Courses</strong> - A variety of online courses that teach you about everything Facebook.</li>
  <li><strong>Webinars</strong> - The webinars they provide around the content they are publishing.</li>
  <li><strong>Live</strong> - The live, in person workshops and courses they provide around the world.</li>
  <li><strong>Case Studies</strong> - Case studies of companies who have used Facebook courses.</li>
  <li><strong>Press</strong> - Press about the Facebook Blueprint, and how they are spreading the word.</li>
  <li><strong>Certifications</strong> - Facebook specific certifications that you can archive.</li>
  <li><strong>Exams</strong> - The tests that are available around the facebook courses.</li>
  <li><strong>How it Works</strong> - Some details about how Facebook training works.</li>
  <li><strong>Policies</strong> - The legal side of things, covering all of our bases.</li>
  <li><strong>FAQ</strong> - Some of the frequently asked questions around the training platform.</li>
  <li><strong>Support &amp; Help</strong> - Where you can get support and more help when it comes to training.</li>
</ul>

<p>Facebook breaks down their training into course categories and learning paths, providing two main ways for potential students to find what they are looking for. Facebook Blueprint provides…well, a blueprint that other API providers and service providers can consider when pulling together your trainings for your API training. Providing online, and offline courses is just the start, and as Facebook shows, there are some additional building blocks that need to be present for it to work.</p>

<p>I have some other API platform training areas to go through before I settle in on a strategy for my own API Evangelist training efforts. Ultimately I want my approach to become a blueprint that my customers can put to work. I’m even looking to turn my API training blueprint into a course by itself, so that I can help some of my customers with their training efforts, and even train the trainers in some situations, providing them with course content, and the awareness of the API space they need to be successful delivering courses within their company, organizations, institution, and government agency. In 2018, I’m investing in my storytelling on API Evangelist, as well as industry guides, white papers, and training material for my readers, and privately wherever it is needed.</p>

        <span class="post-date">22 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/290x195cloudsecurity2014.jpg" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p><a href="http://gearsofbiz.com/carbon-black-edr-service-exposing-customer-data-through-cloud-scanning-update/7096">I was reading about how Carbon Black, an endpoint detection and response (EDR) service, was exposing customer data via a 3r party API service they were using</a>. The endpoint detection and response provider allows customers to optionally scan system and program files using the VirusTotal service. Carbon Black did not realize that premium subscribers of the VirusTotal service get access to the submitted files, allowing an company or government agency with premium access to VirusTotal’s application programming interface (API) can mine those files for sensitive data.</p>

<p>It provides a pretty scary glimpse at the future of privacy and security in a world of 3rd party APIs if we don’t think deeply about the solutions we bake into our applications and services. Each API we bake into our applications should always be scrutinized for privacy and security concerns, making sure end-users aren’t being subjected to unnecessary situations. This situation sounds like it was both API provider and consumer contributing to the privacy violation, and adjusting platform access levels, and communicating with API consumers would be the best path forward.</p>

<p>Beyond just this situation, I wanted to write about this topic as a cautionary tale for the unfolding machine learning API landscape. Make sure we are thinking deeply about what data and content we are making available to platforms via artificial intelligence and machine learning APIs. Make sure we are asking the hard questions about the security and privacy of data and content we are running through machine learning APIs. Make sure we are thinking deeply about what data and content sets we are running through the machine learning APIs, and reducing any unnecessary exposure of personal data, content, and media.</p>

<p>It is easy to be captivated by the magic of artificial intelligence and machine learning APIs. It is easy to view APIs as something external, and not much of a privacy or security threat. However, with each API call we are inviting a 3rd party API into our databases, files, and other private systems. Let’s make sure we have an honest conversation with our API providers about how data and content is accessed, stored, cached, and used as part of any AI or ML process. Let’s make sure we get clarification on which partners, or other 3rd party providers are getting access to data and content that is indexed and executed as part of AI and ML API requests and responses. How long are videos or images stored? How long is data stored?</p>

<p>I’m seeing more discussion around dependencies going on in the API space. Which software libraries, and APIs are we depending on for our applications and services. I’m feeling like this conversation is going to continue expanding and security, privacy, and observability is going to become a more significant part of these dependency discussions. It will be a conversation that continues to push API deployment on-premise, and on-premise, being observable about how ML and AI API operations are being logged, stored, and track on. I’m going to keep watching how APIs are intentionally or unintentionally violating security and privacy like this, and keep an eye on the API dependency conversation to see how it evolves as part of this security and privacy discussion.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/08/22/thank-you-tony/">Thank You Tony</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">22 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/tony-tam.jpg" align="right" width="25%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>Tony Tam, the creator of the OpenAPI specification, formerly known as Swagger, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/i-say-goodbye-swagger-smartbear-openapi-whats-next-tony-tam">has announced he will be exiting his role at OAI and SmartBear</a>. Tony says the specification is in good hands with Ron Ratovsky (<a href="https://twitter.com/webron">@webron</a>), Darrel Miller (<a href="https://twitter.com/darrel_miller">@darrel_miller</a>), and others in the OAI. Tony doesn’t give any hints about what he’ll be up to, but will be walking away from his baby entirely.</p>

<p>I have given Tony a hard time during the transition from Wordnik to SmartBear, and the creation of the OpenAPI, but I am a huge fan of what he has done, and super bummed to see him go–hoping he won’t leave the API community completely. There are many building blocks that go into doing APIs and OpenAPI, or Swagger, is the most significant single building block that has emerged in the seven years I’ve been doing API Evangelist. Swagger has had a profound impact on the world of APIs, and OpenAPI will continue doing this in the future, if the right conditions are still present across the API landscape.</p>

<p>Swagger has helped us talk about our APIs. Swagger has helped us collaborate around our APIs. Swagger has opened up a whole lifecycle of API tooling to help us along our journey. I always felt like Swagger reflected Tony’s personality, and with it’s evolution to OpenAPI, and the OpenAPI Initiative means it’s grown beyond it’s creator. OpenAPI is in good hands. I think it is a good time for Tony to step away, and feel like his baby has begun to grow up, becoming much bigger than what he can do on his own (even with Ron’s amazing help).</p>

<p>Thank you for all your work Tony. You made your mark on the API space. You managed to develop something that was useful for API documentation and code generation, but quickly became about design, testing, monitoring, and every other stops along the API lifecycle. I am stoked to have had the chance to work with you, and spend time telling stories about your important work. I hope you find some time to read some good books, and take time for yourself, and hopefully you don’t go to far from the API space, or at least come back and visit from time to time.</p>
