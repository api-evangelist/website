        <span class="post-date">28 Jan 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-map-grid.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I have most of the core platform that I run API Evangelist on <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">re-engineered as individual microservices</a>, defined on Github, and running using Docker instances. I&rsquo;m using <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/28/using-apisjson-for-my-microservice-navigation-and-discovery">APIs.json for discovery, navigation</a>, and to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/28/using-swagger-as-fingerprint-for-my-microservice-docker-containers">connect swagger API definitions, to their docker backends</a>.  So far I have 18 microservices, which I define as very simple APIs, that do one thing, and focus on doing it well.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very critical about any feature I add in, working hard to keep each service as micro as I can, reducing complexity, and bloat in any single API.  However, with each service I reach the point where I have to cut off feature creep, and establish an entirely new API definition--I am at this point with my link service.</p>
<p>I have a pretty bloated link management system in the legacy version of my platform, something which handles links for functions ranging from <a href="https://pinboard.in/u:kinlane">Pinboard</a> integration, to handling linkrot on my public website. My legacy system runs using an API too, but it is a sloppily designed API, with a wide surface area, something I&rsquo;m looking to prevent in the next version.</p>
<p>So far I&rsquo;ve broken out a single API into three separate microservices:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Link -</strong> A dead simple link management tool, allowing me to add a title, and url to a simple link data store, for future use.</li>
<li><strong>Curated - </strong>A service to manage links I curate from many sources, including additional bells &amp; whistles, like pulling text body, taking screenshot, and much more.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Linkrot -</strong> A link storage system designed for a singe purpose&mdash;to address link rot on my public websites. The API works with a simple JS library to store, monitor, and take screenshots of websites I link to across my network.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have about five other simple, link related, microservices I&rsquo;m planning, but these three designs represent the main link resources I need to make API Evangelist work. All of the microservices I&rsquo;m designing will be open sourced at some point, but the linkrot implementation is one I may also be offering as a service. I&rsquo;m enjoying the feature across my sites, and is something that I think has some viability as a basic service.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure my own definition of what a microservice is--will evolve, ebb and flow, but for now the first rule of microservice club for me, is keep things doing one thing, and doing it very well&mdash;enforcing simplicity in every decision.</p>

        <span class="post-date">27 Jan 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-mobile-security.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>I cringe, when I think about the number of mobile applications out there, that people depend on in their personal and professional lives, that are using insecure APIs, allowing&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personally_identifiable_information">personally identifiable information (PII)</a> to flow across the open Internet. I&rsquo;m a big advocate for helping <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/27/if-you-have-a-publicly-available-mobile-app-you-have-a-public-api/">mobile developers understand the important role that a public API can play in this situation</a>, but another side of the discussions that also scares me is the fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) that also emerges as part of this conversation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve covered recent security and privacy involving mobile usage of APIs at <a href="http://101.apievangelist.com/2014/01/08/are-your-api-security-practices-in-better-shape-than-the-snapchat-api/">Snapchat</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/06/another-high-profile-mobile-to-api-security-breach-this-one-at-moonpig-greeting-cards/">Moonpig</a>, and was processing the API news this morning for inclusion on <a href="http://api.report">API.Report</a>, when I came across this press release, <a href="http://api.report/2015/01/27/wandera-finds-official-nfl-app-to-be-leaking-users-personal-data-just-days-ahead-of-the-big-game/">Wandera Finds Official NFL App to be Leaking Users' Personal Data Just Days Ahead of The Big Game</a>. I can get behind the NFL securing their users personal data, but have a hard time jumping on the bandwagon when this is used as PR for a mobile security service, in the lead up to the Superbowl.</p>
<p>Understanding how everyday mobile apps are using APIs to communicate in the cloud is important. Sharing stories about how to map out this very public surface area, and secure it properly, while giving end-users more awarness and control over their PII is critical. Doing this in the name of marketing, PR, or to ride a fear hype wave is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not ok</span>. Yet, I fear this will become commonplace in coming months and years, as security breaches, cybersecurity, and privacy are front and center in the media.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/01/27/apis-role-in-data-security-and-privacy/">APIs Role In Data Security And Privacy</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">27 Jan 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/api-security.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></p>
<p>As we get close to wrapping up the first month in 2015, it is clear that Internet security and privacy will continue to be front and center this year. As technology continues to play a central role in our personal and business lives--security, transparency, and respect for privacy is only growing more critical.</p>
<p>I know I'm biased in thinking that APIs will continue to take a central role in this conversation, but I feel it is true. Many of the existing conversations around security about platforms like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/27/if-you-have-a-publicly-available-mobile-app-you-have-a-public-api/">Snapchat</a>, and <a href="http://apivoice.com/2015/01/06/another-high-profile-mobile-to-api-security-breach-this-one-at-moonpig-greeting-cards/">MoonPig</a>, are directly related to APIs, while other security scope at companies like Sony, JP Morgan Chase, and beyond could easily be reduced with a sensible API strategy.</p>
<p>Companies are increasingly operating online, but do not act like any of information lives in an online environment. Adopting an API approach to defining company resources, helps map out this surface area, acknowledging it is available over the Internet, and works to define, secure, and monitor this surface in a healthier way.</p>
<p>Mobile users need access to their data, and by applying an API centric approach, providing account management, data portability, and access and identity controls using oAuth, you can increase transparency, while also strengthening overall security. If your company operations is centered around customer and end-user data transactions, you should be making all data points available via an API, accompanied by a well oiled oAuth layer to help end-users manage their resources, playing a significant role in their own privacy and security.</p>
<p>I'm not delusional in thinking that APIs provide a perfect solution for all our security and privacy woes, it doesn't, but it does set a tone for a more healthy conversation about how companies are doing business on the open Internet, and how we can better secure the online web, mobile, and device-based applications we are increasingly depending on in this new world we have created.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/01/26/my-experiences-generating-api-server-or-client-code-using-swagger/">My Experiences Generating API Server or Client Code Using Swagger</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">26 Jan 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-gears.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>When you start talking about generating server or client side code for APIs, using machine readable API definition formats like <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> or <a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>, many technologists feel compelled to let you know, that at some point you will hit a wall. There is only so far you can go, when using your API definition as guide for generating server-side or clienit-side code, but in my experience you can definitely save some significant time an energy, by auto-generating code using Swagger definitions.</p>
<p>I just finished re-designing 15 APIs that support the core of API Evangelist, and to support the work I wrote four separate code generation tools:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>PHP Server - </strong>Generating a Slim PHP framework for my API, based upon Swagger definition.</li>
<li><strong>PHP Client -</strong> Assemble a custom PHP client of my design, using Swagger definition as guide.</li>
<li><strong>JavaScript Client -</strong>&nbsp;Assemble a custom JavaScript client of my design, using Swagger definition as guide.</li>
<li><strong>MySQL Database - </strong>Generate a MySQL script based upon the data models available in a Swagger definition.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using Swagger, I can get myself 90-100% of the way for most of the common portions of the APIs I design. When writing a simple CRUD API like notes, or for links, I can auto-generate the PHP server, and a JS client, and underlying MySQL table structure, which in the end, runs perfectly with no changes.</p>
<p>Once I needed more custom functionality, and have more unique API calls to make, I then have to get my hands dirty, and begin manually working in the code. However auto-generation of code sure gets me a long way down the road, saving me time doing the really mundane, heavy lifting in creating the skeleton code structures I need to get up an running with any new API.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also exploring using <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, complete with <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> references, and Docker image references to further bridge this gap. In my opinion, a Swagger definition for any API, can act as a fingerprint for which interfaces a docker image supports. I will write about this more in the future, as I produce better examples, but I'm finding that using APIs.json to bind a Swagger definition, with one or many Docker images, opens up a whole new view of how you can automate API deployment, management, and integration.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m slowly processing <a href="http://patents.reedtech.com/pgrbft.php">XML files of patents from the US Patent Office</a>. You can <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/25/doing-the-research-in-preparation-for-my-patent-on-a-patent-api/">read the origin of my journey here</a>, but as of today, I finished processing 50 files of patent applications for 2013, adding 973 API related patents to the queue. I&rsquo;m still making sense of the different types of patents, and whether they are specifically for APIs, more API adjacent, or just mention API as one component in the patent definition.</p>
<p>I figure I&rsquo;ll go back to about 1990-1995, but not 100% sure at this point. So far I&rsquo;ve identified 105 patent applications from 2015, 322 from 2014, and now 973 from 2013.

<p>With the other other 1231 mentioning application programming interface or API in the description of the patent. It will take time to understand the scope of role APIs play when APIs are just a metnion in the description, where patents that directly mention in title, and abstract, carry a little more weight. (at least for now)</p>
<p>Another interesting layer so far, were the companies behind the last 2 years of API related patent activity. Here are the top 25 from the list so far.</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft Corporation with 118 patents</li>

<p>I&rsquo;m still learning, understanding, and making sense of these API related patents I&rsquo;m mining. I will work to read, and separate out the hardware related APIs, but only slightly off to the side, as I still think hardware APIs are extremely relevant with the latest IoT evolution. During the process, I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll come up with other buckets to put APIs into, but ultimately looking to understand the role that APIs are playing in the patent game.</p>
<p>I suspect that downloading the last 20+ years of patents, processing them looking for the phrases &ldquo;application programming interface&rdquo;, or the acronym API, is just the beginning. As I read through the patents, learn about the ideas, people, and companies behind them, I&rsquo;m sure my understanding will expand greatly. I&rsquo;ll check in with more data after each import of files, and discovery of any new insights, and as always, you can find my <a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com/">patent API research repository on Github</a>.</p>

<p>David Berlind&rsquo;s (<a href="https://twitter.com/dberlind">@dberlind</a>), <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/news/amid-api-copyright-controversy-api-patent-claim-surfaces/analysis/2015/01/23">Amid The API Copyright Controversy, An API Patent Claim Surfaces</a> story from this last Friday, planted some ideas in my head around APIs and patents&mdash;something that once takes hold, becomes hopeless for me to resist, and 48 hours later, here are my initial thoughts.</p>
<p>Before I begin, let me state, patents and APIs, much like copryight and APIs, are not concepts I subscribe to, but because they are concepts that are being wielded in the API space, I am forced to enter the conversation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll let you read David&rsquo;s piece on Pokitdok&rsquo;s claim regarding their &ldquo;patent-pending API&rdquo; for yourself, something I find very troubling (about Pokitdok). My post is about my journey, after I read David's story, resulting in yet another&nbsp;<a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com/">research project into the politics of patents involving APIs</a>. After reading David's story this Saturday AM (yeah I need a life), I started &ldquo;googling&rdquo; the concept of API patents, just to educate myself&mdash;my eternal mission at API Evangelist.</p>
<p>I was very surprised to find the number of results that come up when you search <a href="https://www.google.com/?tbm=pts&amp;gws_rd=ssl#tbm=pts&amp;q=application+programming+interface">Google Patents for the term &ldquo;application programming interface&rdquo;</a>&mdash;about 552,000 results (0.32 seconds), to be precise. What does this mean? I start reading, and 48 hours later I&rsquo;m still reading. Sure there a number of older patents for hardware APIs, and even many APIs that were established during the web service heyday of the late 90&rsquo;s and early 2000&rsquo;s, but there is much more than that. I was surprised to see the number of patents with APIs as the main focus from API sector leaders like AWS, Twilio, Apigee, and Google.</p>
<p>I have to start with two of the most ironic API patents i have found so far, during my search:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Google</strong> (<a href="http://www.seobythesea.com/2012/04/google-acquires-unisys-patents/">Through Unisys Patent Portfolio Acquisition</a>) - <strong><a href="https://www.google.com/patents/US7437740?dq=Generation+of+Java+language+application+programming+interface+for+an+object-oriented+data+store&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5qDFVKq2BIaGyQTRyIC4Ag&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA">Generation of Java language application programming interface for an object-oriented data store</a></strong> - An embodiment of the present invention is a technique to interface to a repository. A connection between a client and a repository database is established. The repository database has a repository application programming interface (API). The repository database contains objects related to a project management process. The repository API is communicated with to perform an operation based on parameters passed from the client via the connection. A return value associated with the operation is returned to the client.</li>
<li><strong>CopyRightNow</strong> - <strong><a href="https://www.google.com/patents/US20140214700?dq=Disclosed+herein+is+a+method+and+system+for+providing+copyright+protection+for+creative+works+from+within+a+running+content-creating+software+application&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IqHFVOqDDIOxyQSorIKwAw&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA">CopyRightNow Application Programming Interface</a></strong> - Disclosed herein is a method and system for providing copyright protection for creative works from within a running content-creating software application by assembling and submitting a copyright application on the creative work to the United States Copyright Office through the use of a portable application programming interface, which may be utilized by third-party content-creating applications.

Additionally disclosed is a method and system for accessing and sharing copyright-protected creative works through a web accessible software application.</li>
</ul>
<p>I spent most of the day Saturday looking through API patents, trying to separate the hardware from software, and the API adjacent to the specific API patents. I began my journey at <a href="https://www.google.com/?tbm=pts&amp;gws_rd=ssl">Google Patent Search</a>, and eventually find myself using <a href="https://developers.google.com/patent-search/">Google Patent Search API</a> (now deprecated), until I hit the wall, and I end up at the original data source, processing XML files. I&rsquo;m only now getting to year 2013, after 24 hours or making sense of, writing a processing script, and downloading of patent XML files&mdash;so far I have 428 patents where &ldquo;application programming interface&rdquo; shows up in the title, abstract, description, or anywhere else in the content of a patent application.</p>
<p>You can view the <a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com/patents.html">entire patent listing here</a>, and get the <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/patents/blob/gh-pages/data/patents.json">JSON file driving the listing here</a>--as I process each year, going back to 1990, I will publish the resulting JSON.</p>
<p>My head is swimming. Once again I find myself neck deep in a concept I fundamentally disagree with, in hopes of understanding where the battle line exists within the API space, and educate myself enough so that I can articulate a line on this battlefield, in a war I refuse to participate in, yet I find myself sucked into.</p>
<p>From what I can see, API related patents are not something that that will happen in the future, it is already happening, and has been for quite some time. Sure there are many things that need separating when evaluating the 550K API related patents, but after 48 hours of research, I have to say that APIs are being patented at an increasing rate, and is something we just don't talk about publicly.</p>
<p>As I read through many of the titles, and abstracts, of the patent applications within each XML download I&rsquo;ve been processing, I feel like I&rsquo;m reading the antithesis of API Evangelist. On my blog I work every day to better understand how APIs are being used across each business sector, while looking to educate everyone about what is possible, sharing the best practices I discover along the way&mdash;when I read through the API patent abstracts, I see some very educated, and other not so educated bets on how APIs are being used, and where the future might be going, hoping to lock in these ideas, and extract value at some point in time.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I understand that patents are a necessary evil in the world of big business and in startup-land, but it doesn&rsquo;t change my contempt for them. I&rsquo;m sure many of my API heroes like AWS and Twilio are just submitting patents in a defensive stance, but yet again it doesn&rsquo;t shift reduce my concern. To channel my worr around patents being applied in the world of APIs, I&rsquo;m kicking off <a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com/">deeper research, and monitoring in this dark, un-discussed alley of the API economy</a>.</p>
<p>To help me with my research I dowloaded all of 2014 patent submissions,  pulled out all the API related ones, and published as a patent API. To keep up with the amount of patent absurdity that I have read over this beautiful weekend, I have to state my own intent to submit a patent on providing patent APIs. I will take my <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/patent/swagger.json">patent API design</a>, and ensure if you intend to ever organize your patents, and make accessible via APIs you have to pay the piper&mdash;cause you know, this is how this shit gets done!!</p>

<p>i&rsquo;m spending a lot of time lately, playing around with different approaches to deploying APIs in Docker containers. Part of this is because it is the latest trend in API deployment and management, but also because I&rsquo;m preparing for my talk at <a href="http://syd.apidays.io/">API Days in Sydney Australia</a> next month.</p>
<p>I am always working to keep my keynotes in sync with not just my own work, but in alignment with where the wider conversation is going in the API space. I&rsquo;m building off my talk at <a href="http://www.defragcon.com/">Defrag last November</a>, which was titled, "<a href="http://kinlane.github.io/talks/defrag/containers-will-do-for-apis-what-apis-do-for-companies.html">containers will do for APIs what APIs have done for companies</a>".</p>
<p>The title of my talk at API Days in Sydney is, <em>"The Programmable World With APIs And Containers"</em>. While some of my talk will be inspirational, trying to understand where we are headed with APIs and containers, much of it will also be rooted in my own work to run my own business world using APIs and Docker, and using APIs.json and Swagger to help me orchestrate my resources.</p>
<p>I apologize for the gaps in my normal writing, and the heavy focus on Docker lately, but it is where my mind is at, from an operational standpoint, in preparation for the conversation in Australia, and from what I&rsquo;m seeing, it is in sync with the wider API and cloud computing conversation.</p>

<p>The API space is continuing its rapid expansion, and along with the number of API design, deployment, management, and integration providers, and the number of API conferences, there are some new sources of discussion around APIs--one as a YouTube Channel, and the other as a SoundCloud podcast.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKK2ir0jqCvfB-kzBGka_Lg">API Workshop</a> -</strong> We'll discuss topics around API Design, including: sustainability concepts: how to design APIs that last, new ideas in API design, voices and posts from the API blog world.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://soundcloud.com/apisuncensored">APIsUncensored</a> -</strong> The official home of the APIs Uncensored podcast, a monthly series where Ole Lensmar and Lorinda Brandon blather about all things APIs with experts in the industry.</li>
</ul>

<p>API Workshop is a production by J(a)son Harmon (<a href="https://twitter.com/jharmn">@jharmn</a>), and APIsUncensored is from the smart folks over at <a href="http://smartbear.com/">SmartBear</a>(when describing them I always feel tricked into saying they are smart). I was honored to have mentions in both of them, and you can read <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/21/rest-api-design-bridging-what-we-have-to-the-future-by-organizing-the-json-junk-drawer/">my response to API Workshop here</a>, and to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/23/a-conversation-about-my-subway-map-api-on-the-apisuncensored-podcast/">APIsUncensored over here</a>.</p>
<p>In my opnion, it is a healthy sign for the space to see more video and audio outlets emerge&mdash;the space needs as many open voices, educating the masses as it can possess. Maybe soon we'll need an aggregator of all the sources of great information! (get to work on that please)</p>
<p>I posted a video in response to my reference in the API Workshop episode, in addition to my blog post. Something I&rsquo;m working on for APIsUncensored as well, continuing to expand my presence on these important channels. Personally I&rsquo;m a big podcast listener, over YouTubing, but everyone has a different set of frequencies they tune into, and I think it is important to maximize the reach.</p>
<p>Now if only we could get the next episode of <a href="http://trafficandweather.io/">Traffic &amp; Weather!</a> Wink, Wink!</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Jan 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://subway.map.apievangelist.com/index.html"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/subway-map-api.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>There is a new podcast on SoundCloud called <a href="https://soundcloud.com/apisuncensored">APIsUncensored</a>, from the folks over at SmartBear. I was honored to have a mention in the first episode, where they brought up a project I did a couple of months back, which I called the <a href="http://subway.map.apievangelist.com/index.html">Subway Map API</a>. I <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/01/my-turkey-holiday-project-a-subway-map-api/">published a full story on what I was doing</a>, and launched  supporting Github repo, and API, but the work was very much a weekend side project, and something that will need a lot more love before it goes anywhere.</p>
<p>Ole Lensmar (<a href="https://twitter.com/olensmar">@olensmar</a>) admitted that when he introduced the project, he didn&rsquo;t really get it, but ultimately in their segment, they accomplished what I was looking to do&mdash;stimulate conversation. The Subway Map API isn&rsquo;t about the ideas I plotted on the map for API Evangelist, it is about the format for grouping, and mapping out iof deas&mdash;then evolving them through conversation. Don&rsquo;t get hung up on my groupings of API design, deployment, management, etc., because my mission is to help introduce people to the world of providing and consuming APIs.</p>
<p>The goal of the project is to provide a platform where anyone can step up and frame a conversation about the lifecycle that means the most to them, their company, their products, and industry. When I first published the proejct, I quickly sent it out to two groups:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale</a></strong> - Life-cycle to 3Scale is about helping people manage the APIs they&rsquo;ve deployed, and I will be helping create a v1 map, based upon great work that Manfred has done on this subject.</li>
<li><strong><a title="SmartBear" href="http://bit.ly/1oy8CIN">SmarBear</a></strong> - Life-cycle to SmartBear is about helping people monitor, test, and understand the APIs they posses, and if you guys have any stories on your blog to help me see this vision, I can help translate into a map.</li>
</ul>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get hung up on the maps I created, and don&rsquo;t even get hung up on it being a subway map. As Ole mentioned you can add bus routes, train routes, etc. Via the API you can control the color, shapes, direction, connectors and labels for every aspect of the map. If you want to draw a straight line with 10 dots in a row, go for it. If you want to draw a big circle with 10 stops along the way, going all the back to the beginning, go for it.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://subway.map.apievangelist.com/index.html">Subway Map API</a> project was a fun thing I did for the weekend, and was looking to jump-start the conversation, something I think I did--eventually I&rsquo;d love for someone to build an interface for facilitating this conversation. John Musser nailed it when he articulated the overall objective, and that is to create the most meaningful visual as possible, to help someone understand a Wycliffe related to the world of APIs. Think of John&rsquo;s series of hockey stick API growth charts, or his API business  models diagrams, these have become ubiquitous in API discussions, and if you create the next generation one for API design, deployment, management, integration, or other&mdash;you win!</p>
<p>I'll work on a video response to go with this story. I&rsquo;m neck deep in API-micro-service-docker-land, and don&rsquo;t have the bandwidth to pull head up, I love the conversation!</p>

        <span class="post-date">22 Jan 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.httphub.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/Httphub-Logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I come across a lot of API related companies during my monitoring of the space, which I queue up, and as I have time, I work to explore and understand what they do. One company that I&rsquo;ve had open in a tab for the last week is <a href="https://www.httphub.com/">HTTPHUB</a>.</p>
<p>HTTPHUB is very interesting. It starts by giving you a root namespace, like <span style="text-decoration: underline;">https://kinlane.httphub.com</span>, and from there I can add on any resources on, and make it either public or private&mdash;then I can POST any JSON to this resource in the body. So I could create <span style="text-decoration: underline;">https://kinlane.httphub.com/notes/</span>, and craft a simple form + script to post any data I submit to my HTTPHUB resource.</p>
<p>I think that HTTPHUB captures the simplicity of APIs. Obviously the system will have some limitations, but ultimately it makes on boarding with the concept of APIs, and getting up and running with an API backend as frictionless as possible. HTTPHUB also gives you logging, and user management for your namespace, adding some other essential elements you will need for your API backend.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.httphub.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/Httphub-examples.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Here are some of the features of an HTTPHUB account:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlimited requests (rate limited)</li>
<li>3Gb of storage space</li>
<li>300.000 resources</li>
<li>3.000 namespace users</li>
<li>3Mb Max POST size</li>
<li>Signup and quota management for namespace users</li>
<li>Authenticate with credentials or IP address</li>
<li>Register up to 5 different accounts using the same email address</li>
</ul>
<p>HTTPHUB also provides a pretty slick demo feature, using demo test data, in conjunction with <a href="http://www.getpostman.com/">Postman</a>. They provide you with a link to the Postman Chrome app, and a link to a collection file that you can import. This gives you a listing of all of the base endpoints for HTTPHUB, which you can then use to expand, and manage your HTTPHUB API backend--no programming necessary.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.httphub.com/">HTTPHUB</a> is most interesting to me because its simple, intuitive, and potentially something you could self-define exactly the backend resources you need, as you need them. Imagine if applications could grow its own backend? Allowing end-users to add to their world, changing how they store contacts, or take notes&mdash;using a backend that flexes, grows, and fits end-users needs like a glove.</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Jan 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.getpostman.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/postman/postman-logo.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I've been a <a href="http://www.getpostman.com/">Postman</a> user for a while, as a tool for quickly making API calls against the APIs I use most, and explore the new APIs I discover daily. As I use Postman, I can't help but think the concept of assembling collections of API calls using Postman, is in sync with part of our vision for <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>--we just need a common way to communicate.</p>
<p>APIs.json is not just for defining the API operations that exist within a specific domain, which is the most common approach, it is also about assembling collections of multiple APIs, for a specific purpose. In my mind, the motivations for assembling Postman collections, and APIs.json collections are definitely in alignment.</p>
<p>Similar to providing resources for translating between popular API definition formats like <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> and <a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>, I want to make sure and translate between emerging API discovery and collection formats. While I&rsquo;d love for APIs.json to become the default standard for API discovery, I&rsquo;m happy to embrace other formats, designed for other API tools&mdash;as long as they are striving to be as open as they can.</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Jan 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 5px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-hourglass.png" alt="" width="100" align="right" /></p>
<p>I sign up for a lot of APIs, and when I encounter a frictionless on-boarding process, I feel the need to showcase, and help everyone understand how important it is to make the process as easy as possible. I'm still amazed at how many new APIs make this really, really hard. I will write a separate story after this about <span style="text-decoration: underline;">how not to on-board with an API</span>, but for now lets take a look at a kick-ass example.</p>
<p>This example comes from the&nbsp;<a href="http://niaid.github.io/3dpx_api/">National Institutes of Health (NIH) 3D Print Exchange API</a>. When it comes to signing up for API access, the only thing that can make this easier is providing an API for the process, but for right from the home page you can signup for an API key.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/nih-3d-print-exchange-onboarding-1.png" alt="" width="90%" align="middle" /></p>
<p>Once I provide my first name, last name, email, and optionally some details on how I will use the APIs, I am given my API key. I don&rsquo;t have to click again to find my API key, and I&rsquo;m given an example API call, complete with my API key.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/nih-3d-print-exchange-onboarding-2.png" alt="" width="90%" align="middle" /></p>
<p>My first click gives me the instant gratification I am looking for via a simple API call, resulting in an example JSON response. I do not have to work to find my key or figure out how to make my first API call, it is all given to me immediately.</p>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/nih-3d-print-exchange-onboarding-3.png" alt="" width="90%" align="middle" /></p>
<p>I'm up and running with the&nbsp;NIH 3D Print Exchange API in two clicks. I don't have to fill out a long form, wait for access, or work to find my keys, and fumble with how to make my first API call. To reenforce this, I look in my email inbox, and there is an email providing my API keys again, along with the link to make my first API call.</p>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/nih-3d-print-exchange-onboarding-4.png" alt="" width="90%" align="middle" /></p>
<p>Like I said above, the only thing that would make that easier, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/16/with-number-of-apis-continuing-to-grow-account-automation-will-be-key/">is for all of this to be a series of API calls, which would make the on-boarding process programmatic</a>. Eventually I could see this being essential, but for now I'm happy to see them not only standardizing API on-boarding across federal agencies, but making it as dead simple as you possibly can.</p>
<p>I'm a big fan of frictionless API on-boarding, and I applaud NIH and 18F for their work on the&nbsp;NIH 3D Print Exchange API. I will keep an eye on future releases, for more stories on healthy patterns I'm seeing in API deployment in the federal government.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update: </strong>I'm aware I left my keys in these pics, it was easier to reset them, then to blurr them out, and I think it helps with point. ;-)</em></p>

<p>I referenced the <a href="https://ridb.recreation.gov/">Recreation Information Database (RIDB)</a>, in my story late last year, when I was <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/16/i-need-help-to-make-sure-the-dept-of-agriculture-leads-with-apis-in-their-parks-and-recreation-rfp/">asking for your help to make sure the Department of Agriculture leads with APIs in their parks and recreation RFP</a>.  I'm not exactly sure where it fits in with the RFP, because the RIDB spans multiple agencies.</p>
<p>Here is the description from the RIDB site:</p>
<blockquote><em>RIDB is a part of the Recreation One Stop (Rec1Stop) project, initiated as a result of a government modernization study conducted in 2004. Rec1Stop provides a user-friendly, web-based resource to citizens, offering a single point of access to information about recreational opportunities nationwide. The web site represents an authoritative source of information and services for millions of visitors to federal lands, historic sites, museums, and other attractions/resources.</em></blockquote>
<p>When I wrote the post last October, I referenced the <a href="http://ridb-dev.nsitellc.com/docs/api/v1/RIDB_API_Requirements_20150113.pdf">PDF for the REST API Requirements for the US Forest Service Recreation Information Database (RIDB</a>), but this week I got an update, complete with <a href="http://ridb-dev.nsitellc.com/docs/api/v1/#introduction">fresh links to a preview of a pretty well designed API</a>, complete with <a href="https://github.com/tripit/slate">documentation developed using Slate</a>.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t actually hacked on the endpoints, but I took a stroll through the docs, and my first impression was it is well designed, and robust, including resources for organizations involved with the RDB, recreational areas, facilities, campsites, permit entrances, tours, activities, events, media, and links.  The RIDB documentation also includes details on errors, pagination, version, and a data dictionary, and the on-boarding was frictionless when looking to get a key.</p>
<p>Everything is in dev mode with the RIDB API, and the team is looking for feedback. I&rsquo;m not entirely sure they wanted me to publish as story on API Evangelist, but I figure the more people involved the better, as I&rsquo;m not sure when I&rsquo;ll get around to actually hacking on the API. I&rsquo;m happy to see such a quick iteration towards the next generation of the RIDB API, and it makes me hopeful to be covering so many new API efforts out of the federal government in a single day.</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Jan 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MBXsmSrKE8"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/REST-API-Design-Avoid-future-proofing-with-the-JSON-junk-drawer-YouTube.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>API storyteller J(a)son Harmon (<a href="https://twitter.com/jharmn">@jharmn</a>) has a new YouTube channel up called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKK2ir0jqCvfB-kzBGka_Lg">API Workshop</a>. He's going to be publishing regular API design workshop episodes, with the latest one titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKK2ir0jqCvfB-kzBGka_Lg">REST API Design: Avoid future proofing with the JSON junk drawer</a>. J(a)son provides a nice overview of how you should be structuring the JSON for your API, focusing on the usage of key / value stores. Ironically he uses APIs.json as an example of why you <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SHOULD NOT</strong></span> use custom key / values within your JSON. What is ironic about this, is that he makes the case for APIs.json properties, giving me a great starting point for helping folks better understand <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, and why properties are key to its evolution, and flexibility.</p>
<p>The process J(a)son outlines in the portion of this segment that referred to APIs.json, describes the lifecycle of an APIs.json property, towards becoming more of a "first class property". There are three phases of an APIs.json property:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>X-Property - </strong>A user defined property, allowing anyone to craft exactly the properties that matter to them</li>
<li><strong>Property - </strong>An official machine readable APIs.json property element, acknowledging its wide usage, potential as common blueprint</li>
<li><strong>"First Class Property or Collection"&nbsp;</strong>- Baking a property into the specification as default property of APIs collection, or establishing as sub-collection for the API</li>
</ol>
<p>The lesson J(a)son provides, describes the journey of each APIs.json property, the difference is in that his lesson provides best practices for API providers who are designing new APIs, helping them avoid the creation of a junk drawer, and the APIs.json property format is being applied to define the junk drawer that we have (aka the public API space). This represents the fundamental separation between my approach to defining the space vs. many other technologists&mdash;I am trying to map out what we have, and get us the next step in our evolution, while others are working hard to define where we should be going.</p>
<p>When Steve and I originally hammered out the <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json format</a>, we couldn't 100% agree on what should be first class properties and collections for each API defined using an APIs.json file&mdash;what you see in version 0.14 is what we agreed to, the rest needs to be defined by the community, through actually implementations and discussion on the <a href="https://github.com/api-commons/api-json/issues">APIs.json Github repo</a>.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-recycling.jpg" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p>When you are crafting the JSON, for a new API, J(a)son&rsquo;s lesson is very important, but when you are evaluating hundreds of APIs, and trying to define a common pattern for representing not just the tech, but the business, and politics of an API&mdash;you don&rsquo;t have as much control over how things get defined. I&rsquo;m not worried about the overhead involved with adding a little more complexity to my code, to bridge the well-defined aspects of API operations with the lesser-defined parts of the space.</p>
<p>Ideally, in one of the next iterations of APIs.json, the official properties of Swagger, RAML, Blueprint, and WADL can move up into a first class collection for each API called definitions, and maybe also consider moving API Commons up to be a first class licensing collection as well.  I&rsquo;m also looking to graduate some X-properties to official status, based upon <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">creating APIs.json for over 700+ companies</a>, and having identified almost <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/blob/gh-pages/data/properties.json">150 separate properties that can be used to describe API operations</a>. All of this represents the API sector coming into focus, and I do not think all of these properties should become "first class" properties or collections&mdash;I am just trying to make sense of the "junk drawer" that we have, and help provide a blueprint for a machine readable formats that can help us evolve it towards the future we want.</p>
<p>I have been asked by several folks to better explain Steve and mine APIs.json vision, and J(a)son&rsquo;s story gives me the opportunity to help kick off this storytelling. In an effort to keep this story short, I&rsquo;m going to follow J(a)son&rsquo;s lead and move the rest of this story on to YouTube, so if you want to better understand APIs.json properties, you can watch my video response to J(a)son's story, which augments this post, and hopefully provides some better examples, along with narrative.</p>

        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-no.png" alt="" width="100" align="right" /></p>
<p>I wrote a piece earlier today about the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/21/this-is-how-you-onboard-with-an-api/">kick-ass on-boarding process at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) 3D Print Exchange API</a>--within two clicks I had my API key and was making an API call. To contrast this post I wanted to provide an example of how not to on-board with an API.</p>
<p>I am always amazed at how hard people make it to sign up and play with an API in 2015. Today's example of on-boarding with the most friction you can imagine comes from the <a href="http://developer.garmin.com/wellness-api/request-the-api/">Garmin Wellness API</a>--I think their API signup form speaks for itself.</p>
<p><a href="http://developer.garmin.com/wellness-api/request-the-api/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/garmin-onboarding-form.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>I understand you are worried about what people might do with your API, but that is kind of the whole point of doing an API. If you are looking to encourage innovation on your API, this is not how you want to on-board your developers, and make a first impression.</p>
<p>There are other ways to manage API integrations without restricting users from day one. Make sure and help make API on-boarding as frictionless as possible, there is no reason to use a form like Garmin has.</p>

<p>There is an very interesting new 3D Print Exchange API from the <a href="http://www.nih.gov/">National Institutes of Health (NIH)</a>. The NIH 3D Print Exchange is designed for publishing "biomedically-relevant" 3D models, that anyone can download and use as blueprint for printing on a their 3D printer.</p>
<p>I've been <a href="http://3d-printing.apievangelist.com/companies.html">tracking on 3D printing APIs since 2011</a>, when I started profiling <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/12/19/api-driven-3d-printing-and-manufacturing-supply-chain/">how APIs were being used by printing, and 3D printing providers</a>. It is interesting to see an industry focused 3D printing API emerge, which I feel is a sign the space is maturing, and will continuing to evolve in 2015.</p>
<p>Another thing to note in this story, is simplistic approach the NIH took in deploying their API. The 3D Print Exchange API has all the essential building blocks to help you understand what the API does, on-board with the API (another story), and get the support you need throughout integration via <a href="https://twitter.com/nih3dprint">Twitter</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/niaid/3dpx_api">Github</a>, and <a href="mailto: 3dprint@nih.gov">email</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://niaid.github.io/3dpx_api/">3D Print Exchange API</a> has all the fingerprints of <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">18F</a> on it, demonstrating that APIs in the federal government will continue to pick up momentum with the assistance of 18F of the Presidential Innovation Fellowship (PIF) program out of the White House and GSA.</p>

<p>An open project for me this month, is about better understanding how API keys are provisioned, and how developers are given access to valuable resources. As the number of APIs grows, so do the number of APIs that we depend on in any single application, forcing developer to have to manage many API keys, potentially from many different platforms.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t take an API expert to see that many <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/16/with-number-of-apis-continuing-to-grow-account-automation-will-be-key/">current practices by API providers requiring consumers to manually register for an account, will not scale</a>. We need more automated ways for not just discovering, but also on-boarding with APIs, allowing API consumers to begin using an API, without the current overhead required.</p>
<p>One idea I&rsquo;m bouncing around in my own APIs, is allowing for instant account creation via an API, allowing you to programmatically generate new account, a new app, and API keys. Of course I do not want these new accounts to have full access to everything, and using my 3Scale API management I will create a specific service tier for these accounts, limiting what they can do.</p>
<p>I want to take this another step further though, I do not want just any spammy, Johnny come-along to be able to create new accounts, without any sort of validation. To help filter, I&rsquo;m developing a Github account ranking layer, requiring you to pass along your Github user with the generation of new account, app, and keys. I will pull the profile for the Github user, and some statistics on their overall profile, and make some assumptions on the developers trustworthiness.</p>
<p>Immediately this approach will limit API access for a number of people, which in some scenarios may not be ideal, but for my APIs, I&rsquo;m willing to allow instant account creation, and API access to people who have an active, verifiable Github presence. I&rsquo;ve been a proponent of API providers providing Github login for developer accounts for some time now, and this seems like a logical next step.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see where I go with this. It is more an exercise than it is a real thing, but who knows, in addition to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/14/storing-api-keys-in-the-private-master-github-repository-for-use-in-github-pages/">using Github to manage my API keys securely</a>, maybe I can actually use it to instantly access new APIs, without having the current overhead I face with each new API on-boarding experience.</p>

<p>My <a href="http://kinlane.com/2013/01/02/all-side-projects-are-now-hosted-on-github/">public websites have been running on Github Pages for almost two years now</a>, and slowly the private management tools for my platform are moving there as well. Alongside my public websites, I&rsquo;m adding administrative functions for each projects. Most of the content is API driven already, so it makes sense to put some of the management tools side by side with the content or data that I&rsquo;m publishing.</p>
<p>These management tools are simple JavaScript, that use the Github API to manage HTML, and JSON files that I have stored either publicly or privately within repositories. I use Github oAuth to work with the Github API, but to work with other APIs I need a multitude of other API keys, including <a href="http://3scale.net">3Scale generated API keys</a> I use to access my own API infrastructure.</p>
<p>My solution is to store a simple api-keys.json file in the root of my private master repository, and then again using Github oAuth, and the Github API, I access this file, read the content of the JSON file into a temporary array I can use wthin my management tools. If you do not have access to the Github repository, you won&rsquo;t be able to read the contents of api-keys.json, rendering the management tools useless.</p>
<p>I will develop a centralized solution to helping manage API keys across all my projects, allowing me to re-use keys for different projects, and easily update, or remove outdated API keys. This approach to storing API keys in my private Github repository is allowing me to easily access keys in client-side apps I run on Github Pages, as well as via server-side applications and APIs&mdash;something that I&rsquo;m hoping will give me more flexibility in how I put multiple APIs across my infrastructure.</p>

<p>My <a href="http://kinlane.com/2013/01/02/all-side-projects-are-now-hosted-on-github/">public websites have been running on Github Pages for almost two years now</a>, and slowly the private management tools for my platform are moving there as well.

<p>When I discuss what is possible when it comes to generating both server and client side code using machine readable API definitions like <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a>, I almost always get push-back, making sure I understand there are limitations of what can be auto-generated.</p>
<p>Machine readable API definitions like Swagger provide a great set of rules for describing the surface area of an API, but is often missing many other elements necessary to define what server side code should actually be doing. The closest I&rsquo;ve gotten to fully generating server side APIs, is when it came to very CRUD-based APIs, that possess a very simple data models--beyond that it is difficult to make "ends meet".</p>
<p>Personally, I do not think my Swagger specs should contain everything needed to define server implementations, this would make for a very bloated, and unusable Swagger specification. For me, Swagger is my central truth, that I use in generating <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/06/server-skeletons-in-restlet-studio-and-apispark/">server side skeletons</a>, client side samples and libraries, and to define testing, monitoring, and interactive documentation for developers.</p>
<p>Working to push this approach forward, I&rsquo;m also now using Swagger as a central truth for my Docker containers, allowing me to use virtualization as a bridge between what my Swagger definitions cannot define for each micro-service or API deployed within a specific container.  This approach is leaving Swagger as purely a definition of the micro-service surface area, and leaving my Docker image to deliver on the back-end vision of this surface area.</p>
<p>These Docker images are using Swagger as a definition for its container surface area, but also as a fingerprint for the value it delivers. As an example, I have a notes API definition in Swagger, for which I have two separate Docker images that support this interface. Each Docker image knows it only serves this particular Swagger specification, using it as a kind of fingerprint or truth for its own existence, but ultimately each Docker image will be delivering its own back-end experience derived from this notes API spec.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just getting going with this new approach to using Swagger as a central truth for each Docker container, but as I&rsquo;m rolling out each of my API templates with this approach, I will blog more about it here. Eventually I am hoping to standardize my thoughts on using machine readable API definition formats like Swagger to guide the API functionality I'm delivering in virtualized containers.</p>

<p>I continuing to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/10/using-containers-to-bridge-what-swagger-cannot-define-on-the-serverside-for-my-apis/">evolve my use of Swagger as a kind of central truth in my API design, deployment, and management lifecycle</a>. This time I&rsquo;m using it as a fingerprint for defining how APIs or micro-services that run in Docker containers function. Along the way I&rsquo;m also using <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> as a framework for organizing these Swagger driven containers, into coherent API stacks or collections, that work together to accomplish a specific objective.</p>
<p>For the project I&rsquo;m currently working on, I&rsquo;m deploying multiple Swagger defined APIs, each as separate Docker containers, providing some essential components I need to operate API Evangelist, like blog, links, images, and notes. Each of these components have its own Swagger definition, and corresponding Docker image, and specific instance of that Docker image deployed within a container.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m using APIs.json to daisy chain all of these APIs or micro-services together. I have about 15 APIs deployed, each are standalone services, with their own APIs.json, and supporting Swagger definition, but the overall project has a centralized APIs.json, which using the includes properties, provides linkage to each individual micro-services APIs.json--loosely coupling all of these container driven micro-services under single umbrella.</p>
<p>At this point, I&rsquo;m just using APIs.json as a harness to define, and bring together the technical aspects of my new API stack. As I pull together other business elements like on-boarding, documentation, and code samples, I will add these as properties to my parent APIs.json. My goal is to demonstrate the value&nbsp;<a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> brings to the table when it comes to API and micro-service discovery, specifically when you deploy distributed API stacks or collections using Docker container deployed micro-services.</p>

        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-anonymous-person.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I find it more valuable to scrub the names of the APIs from about 75% of my stories, which I feel helps them be received by a widest possible audience as possible. If I say &ldquo;API Provider X&rdquo;, other providers just think I&rsquo;m talking about that company, but when I make it generic, I find API providers think I&rsquo;m talking about them.</p>
<p>There are many reasons I would scrub individual or company names from a story, most often this is because they&rsquo;ve asked me not to reference them public, but are fine with me telling the story in an anonymous fashion. However, it occurred to me over time that there are other more powerful storytelling influences potentially behind leaving out specific characters.</p>
<p>Early on I identified that there are a lot of API lessons to be learned across business sectors, but if you reference the specific company, or business sector, many business leaders or developers will put there blinders on, feeling this doesn&rsquo;t apply to them. Ideally companies would identify the potential of hearing stories from other ways of doing business, but unfortunately many lack the imagination to make the transition&mdash;lucky I have enough imagination to go around! ;-)</p>
<p>I thoroughly enjoy storytelling in the API space. Over the last four years I&rsquo;ve developed a voice I enjoy speaking in, and have slowly built an entire toolbox of approaches like scrubbing people or company names, to make my storytelling more impactful, and potentially reach a wider audience. I feel strongly that I would never have been able to do this if API Evangelist was purely a marketing blog for a company, but because I&rsquo;m lucky enough to be able to focus exclusively on entire API space, spanning multiple business sectors, and left to my own devices when it comes to the editorial choices--I&rsquo;ve been able to grow my storytelling in ways I never imagined in 2010 when I first started.</p>

<p>I talked about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/29/adding-rate-limits-for-apis-in-the-documentation-for-each-endpoint/">Twitter's inclusion of rate limits inline with documentation the other day, which is something I added as a new building block</a>, that API providers can consider when crafting their own strategy. Another building block I found while spending time in the Twitter ecosystem, was an oAuth signature generator inline within the documentation.</p>
<p>While browsing the <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public">Twitter documentation</a>, right before you get to the example request, you get a little dropdown that lets you select from one of your own applications, and generate an oAuth signature without leaving the page.</p>

<p>I am seeing oAuth signature generators emerge in a number of API platforms, but this is the first inline version I&rsquo;m seeing. I&rsquo;ve added this to my tentative list of oAuth and security building blocks I recommend, but will give some time before I add. I like to see more than one provider do something before I put it in there, but sometimes when it is just Twitter, that can be enough.</p>

I feel better about IoT security and privacy when I hear things like this, but ultimately I am left with overwhelming concern about of the quantity of IoT devices.</p>
<p>There are many layers to securing IoT devices, and protecting the privacy of IoT users, but I can't help but the think that Internet of Things security and privacy will always begin by asking ourselves if we should be doing this at all. Do we need this object connected to the Internet? Are we truly benefiting from having this item enabled with cloud connectivity?</p>
<p>I'm going to try and keep up with tracking on the API layer being rolled out in support of IoT devices, but not sure I will be able to keep up with the number of devices, and the massive amount of hype around products and services. At some point I may have to tap out, and focus on specific aspects of IoT connectivity ,around what I consider the politics of APIs.</p>

<p>I'm about 1/3 of the way into <a href="http://theapistack.com/">generating Swagger specifications for the APIs at the 700+ companies that I monitor.</a> I have the Swagger specs for almost 250 APIs so far, and have no idea how many I&rsquo;ll have when I'm done (ha, will I ever be done), as the target is kind of ever moving. The only way to get to know an API better than having to create a Swagger spec for it, is to actually integrate with it.</p>
<p>Thankfully I&rsquo;m not integrating with ALL of the APIs I monitor, but I do want to get more intimate with their API surface area, right up to actually having to integrate. There are four ways that I obtain a machine readable API definition for an API:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Manually</strong> - Good ol fashioned elbow grease because there is nothing standard about an APIs documentation, or even the API itself, forcing me to hand craft a Swagger definition that works.</li>
<li><strong>Scraping</strong> - Some APIs documentation is pretty standardized, making it very easy to write a scrape script that harvests, and generates a Swagger skeleton of endpoints, headers, parameters, and other aspects of the interface.</li>
<li><strong><a title="APITools" href="https://www.apitools.com/">APITools</a></strong> - Some APIs that I&rsquo;m actually integrating with, going beyond just a review of their API, I use APITools as a proxy, and make all my API calls via this proxy, and after I hit all the endpoints, I can grab the auto-generated Swagger definition from the APITools interface.</li>
<li><strong>Swagger</strong> - There is already a Swagger definition available for an API, created by the platform owner&mdash;this is when I&rsquo;m in heaven. I love it when APIs create their own API definition, and even better when they create their own <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> file. ;-)</li>
</ul>
<p>I would like to also add to the list, that I use API Blueprint, RAML, I/O Docs, and Apigee Explorer formats as well, but I do not. While these formats are out there, it is an understatement to say they are tucked away, and hidden. I&rsquo;d venture to say the providers are actively assisting API providers in keeping buried, and hard to access&mdash;in my opinion each format should be front and center, accessible with a single click.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons I use <a href="http://swagger.io/">Swagger</a>. If you look at Swagger UI docs, for each endpoint there is a RAW link which takes you directly to the machine readable API definition that drives it. Show me the equivalent on API Blueprint, RAML, Mashery, and Apigee API explorers, and interactive documentation and I&rsquo;ll eat my words. I'm creating my own API stack for converting between all of these formats, but alas this doesn't help me in my API discovery process, because these formats aren't easy to find.</p>
<p>This disconnect, is one of the reasons there is so much fragmentation in API designs, and ultimately a lack of open tooling and services that support the entire API life-cycle&mdash;nobody wants to share their design patterns. Please help me document all the APIs in <a href="http://theapistack.com">my API Stack</a>, and if you know of an existing Swagger spec I don&rsquo;t have, send my way, or <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">publish to the Github repo</a>. Also, if you are actively using an API, can you switch to using an <a href="https://www.apitools.com/">APITools proxy and generate a Swagger spec</a> that way, and also send my way, or <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">publish to the Github repo</a>.</p>
<p>I wish I could convince all y'all of the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/21/making-sure-the-most-important-layers-of-api-space-stay-open/">importance of this layer of the API space being not just machine readable, but also accessible</a>. This is one reason why I&rsquo;m hand rolling all of these API definitions myself, is because I&rsquo;m just going to show you.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&ldquo;using Fuse as a means to explore how a larger, more owner-controlled Internet of Things experience could be support</em>ed&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m intrigued by this concept, and feel it reflects my mission with API Evangelist, where I&rsquo;m looking to create not just a more educated and informed API providers and consumers, but also a more knowledgable, and empowered end-user.</p>
<p>The concept of a owner-controlled Internet of Things experience is something I will be keeping an eye on as I continue to be inundated with Internet of Things API stories. My goal is to better understand how IoT devices are being designed, and deployed, then provide some assistance in how we can ensure platforms lean towards a more &ldquo;owner-controlled experience&rdquo;.</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Jan 2015</span>
        <p><a href="/admin/blog/bit.ly/13esk6Q"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/3Scale/3scale-logo.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>As I am designing my APIs, one of the first things I decide is whether or not I will be making this public. If its a simple enough resource, and doesn't put too much load on my servers, I will usually make it publicly available. However if an API has write capabilities, could potentially put a heavy load on my servers, or just posses some private resource that I want to keep private, I will secure the API.</p>
<p>I use <a href="/admin/blog/bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale for my API management infrastructure</a>--I have since 2011, long before I ever started working with them on projects, and organizing <a href="https://twitter.com/apistrat">@APIStrat</a>. When it comes time to secure any of my APIs, I have a default snippet of code that I wrap each API, validating the application keys, and recording their activity--which 3Scale calls the plugin integration approach.</p>
<p>This time around, I logged into my 3Scale admin area, went to my API integration area, and saw the setup for the 3Scale Cloud API proxy that they are calling <a href="http://www.3scale.net/apicast/">APICast</a>. I can't help but notice the simple setup of the proxy--I give it a private base URL for my API, it gives me a public base URL back, and then I can configure the proxy rules, setting the rate limits for each of my API resources.</p>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/3scale-apicast.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is it. I can set up my APIs in a sandbox environment, then take it live when I am ready. It is the quickest way to secure my APIs I've seen, allowing me to instantly lock down my APIs, and require anyone who uses it to register for a key, and then I am able to track on how it is being put to use&mdash;no server configuration or setup needed.</p>
<p>This easy setup, bundled with the fact you can setup 3Scale for free, and get up to 50K a day in API calls, makes it the perfect environment for figuring out your API surface area. Then when ready, you can pay for heavier volume, and take advantage of the other advanced features available via 3Scale. I'm still using the plugin feature for 90% of my endpoints, but some I will be using APICast to quickly stand-up, secure, and monitor some of my APIs. I will publish a how-to after I finish setting this one up.</p>

<p>When you use a well designed, and I hate saying it, but a RESTful API, you know it. I&rsquo;m not a <a href="http://mikeschinkel.com/blog/whatisarestafarian/">restafarian</a>, who is super strict about API design, but I do know an easy-to-use, intuitive interface when I hack on one. Having API resources defined as intuitive URIs, with a handful of sensible header or query parameters, that allows me to excercise my HTTP Verbs, just makes me happy.</p>
<p>I do not expect all API providers to be API design experts, but one design pattern that always frustrates me is when you  pack all of your API resources into a single parameter. <a href="https://www.flickr.com/services/api/">Flickr calls it &ldquo;method&rdquo;</a>, and <a href="http://docs.brightcove.com/en/video-cloud/media/references/reference.html#Video_Read">Brightcove calls it &ldquo;command&rdquo;</a>, and while both of these media API providers then offer a rich number of &ldquo;methods&rdquo; or &ldquo;commands&rdquo;, I just can&rsquo;t help feel this single design decision always detours API integrationa &nbsp;down bumpier, darker side street or alley.</p>
<p>Ultimately I can still get what I need done with APIs who choose to craft their resources in this way, but it takes more work, and requires me to create a special bucket of APIs, that don&rsquo;t quite fit in with the rest of the APIs I&rsquo;m profiling, and integrating with. I&rsquo;m often tempted, with the high profile APIs like Flickr and Brightcove, to craft a new API, and stand it up as a facade that you can use as a proxy, instead of directly connecting to Flickr and Brightcove APIs, but alas not enough time in the day.</p>
<p>You will almost never catch me giving API design advice on API Evangelist, but in this scenario, I have urge you not to follow the design patterns of Flickr and Brightcove when planning your APIs.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/01/07/my-dream-stack-for-machine-readable-apisjson-properties/">My Dream Stack For Machine Readable APIs.json Properties</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">07 Jan 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-stacks.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>The properties of each API that is listed in an<a href="http://apisjson.org/"> APIs.json file</a> can be called anything, as long as you preface it with X-, and the URL can point to anything you wish--to me<a href="http://apisjson.org/2014/07/09/the-power-in-api-discovery-for-apisjson-will-be-in-the-api-url-type/"> this is one of the most flexibile aspects of APIs.json</a>. The majority of APIs.json API properties are going to be to URLs designed for human consumption, but the ultimate goal of the project is to establish a core set of machine readable URIs that will help move the API discovery conversation forward.</p>
<p>The first three machine readable properties for APIs listed in an APIs.json are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a title="API Blueprint" href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a></strong> - The machine readable API definition format in markdown.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://swagger.io/">Swagger</a></strong>&nbsp;- The machine readable API definition format in JSON and YAML.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://raml.org/">RAML</a></strong>&nbsp;- The machine readable API definition format in YAML.</li>
</ul>
<p>APIs.json is not looking to provide the solution for the same thing that sensibly designed hypermedia APIs would bring to the table, and only interested in bridging the indexing of the API resources that are currently available. In this context, think of APIs.json as a switchboard, allowing us to navigate each of the popular API definition formats available to use in 2015.</p>
<p>The fourth machine readable property for APIs listed in an APIs.json is:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a> - </strong>A machine readable format for associating licensing fo ran API interface (aka CC, Apache).</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://apisjson.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/apis-json/apisdotjson.png" alt="" width="400" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>With&nbsp;<a href="http://apisjson.org/format/apisjson_0.14.txt">APIs.json version .014</a>, we now have a glimpse of the surface area of APIs present within each APIs.json file, via the API Blueprint, Swagger, and RAML properties, and a basic awarness of the licensing of this surface area using the API Commons property.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not 100% sure what is next for APIs.json property types, but if I had my vote (which I probably do ;-), I&rsquo;d be interested in seeing machine readable references to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Monetization</span> Value - </strong>Units of measurement, allowing me to understand the value delivered by an API. I do not think monetization is an apt title for this area, as money is such a limiting constraint, and value is a more expansive headspace to approach this aspect of API integration.</li>
<li><strong>API <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Terms of Service</span> Questions - </strong>I feel that questions about the terms of service from API providers gets a lot of airplay, but this conversation is much like the TOS themselves, and are heavily weighted in discussion through a provider lens, drowning in legaleze. I&rsquo;m confident that this area needs distillation from its current legaleze format, and be framed as simple questions that span TOS, Privacy Policies, SLA, Copyright, Deprecation, Branding, and other legal layers to API operations.</li>
<li><strong>API <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Clients</span> Connectivity - </strong>Give me a machine readable list of connecitivty options that are available for an API. I want to know what languages area available, as well as links to licensing, code repositories, and Zapier integrations. This is a layer of the conversation that would be better served through a hypermedia conversation, but since we have the world we have, this is a layer of the APIs.json conversation.</li>
</ul>
<p>For me, APIs.json takes the <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">API discovery</a> conversation beyond just the meta, which, don&rsquo;t get me wrong is super valuable, with titles, description, tags, and other characteristics of APIs are critical to discovery, but I want to also be able to go deeper than just a simple keyword search. I want to be able to dig in on the areas above, but in a machine readable, bottom up, organic way.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-discovery.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></p>
<p>I want to be able to ask for:</p>
<ul>
<li>All image APIs, that have a per MB storage, and bandwidth API Value model vs. free or advertising based approaches. I also want to make sure they allow me to set the licensing for my photos, delete my account when done, and have a PHP client, or even better a WordPress plugin.</li>
<li>All video APIs, that have a revenue share model for their own advertising network, as a API Value model. Same as my images I want to make sure they let me set the licensing for videos, and retain ownership over my model. In this case I don&rsquo;t care about specific language clients for integrations, I want to see connectivity for Vimeo, Facebook, Twitter, and other distribution channels.</li>
</ul>
<p>A number of conversation I have had around APIs.json with technologists almost always begins with a very technical API discovery discussion, something that quickly expands to the wider vision opened up by APIs.json around value generated by APIs, limitations imposed by the legal layer of platform operations, and into how we actually connect with valuable API resources. There are many more influences that prevent me from connecting to APIs, than just the technical aspects of integration&mdash;pricing, TOS, privacy, rate limits, and other business and political limitations often trump the tech when I select API platforms.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still working through exactly how to best articulate Steve and mine&rsquo;s vision for APIs.json. I appreciate you listening to my thoughts, as I work through the details, and I would love to hear more of your thoughts around what APIs.json means to you.</p>

<p>I was <a href="https://developers.google.com/helpouts/">cruising around the Google Developer area</a> and I stumbled across <a href="https://helpouts.google.com/partner/landing/provider/googledevelopers">Google Helpouts.</a> A service being billed as <em>&ldquo;Experts with Answers, Meet Developers with Questions&rdquo;</em>. Seems like a more one-to-one version of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>, where you can get the answers you are looking for when it comes to development on the Google platform, but in a more direct, one-to-one way.</p>
<p>Inversely, you can contribute your developer skills, and be one of the knowledgeable developers who are giving back to the developer community. The Google Helpouts page describes it as: <em>Give Back - Continue Learning - Build Your Reputation</em>. I signed up for an account, gave my profile, but the tags that I was able to connect with my profile really didn&rsquo;t match my skills. It seems very programming language, and platform focused at this point--not really for APIs.</p>
<p><a href="https://helpouts.google.com/partner/landing/provider/googledevelopers"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/google-helpouts2.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>At first glance I thought Google Helpouts was more about Google APIs, available as an exentsion of the Google Developer program, but it seems to be a more tech focused, skills matching service. I think the same concept would work well, if applied to APIs, but I don&rsquo;t see any reason for a new platform, just build it on top of <a href="https://api.stackexchange.com/docs">Stack Overflow API</a>&mdash;why re-invent the wheel?</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Jan 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://dp.la/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/digital-public-library-of-america/DPLA_logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>If I had to pick one API that I worship the ground they walk on, and yet for some insane reason I don&rsquo;t write about very often&mdash;it would be the <a href="http://dp.la/">Digital Public Library of America</a>. I can go on for days about how important the work that DPLA does. If you aren&rsquo;t up to speed on DPLA, "The Digital Public Library of America brings together the riches of America&rsquo;s libraries, archives, and museums, and makes them freely available to the world&rdquo;&mdash;via APIs! ;-)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a history lover, so DPLA is extremely interesting, but what they do is so much more important to society at-large, an area that very few APIs can achieve. I am making an extra effort to publish more DPLA stories on API Evangelist, not just because they need it, but also because their approach to APIs is extremely forward thinking and relevant.</p>
<p>First DPLA story out of my writers notebook is about their use of <a href="http://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a>. First off, what is JSON-LD?</p>
<blockquote><em><a href="http://json-ld.org/"> JSON-LD is a lightweight Linked Data format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is based on the already successful JSON format and provides a way to help JSON data interoperate at Web-scale.</a></em></blockquote>
<p>So why does DPLA uses JSON-LD? I like their explanation on the <a href="http://dp.la/info/developers/codex/policies/technologies/">DPLA technologies page</a>:</p>
<blockquote><em><a href="http://dp.la/info/developers/codex/policies/technologies/"> Everyone likes JSON, but it&rsquo;s not great for every purpose.  Pointing from one JSON object to another is a good example (because we do that a lot).  So we use JSON-LD. No worries &ndash; it&rsquo;s still JSON.  It&rsquo;s just got a couple of standardized fields. </a></em></blockquote>
<p>When you are weaving together artifacts from &ldquo;america&rsquo;s libraries, archives, and museums&rdquo;, then providing access as linked data and via APIs, you need to get pretty organized about how you keep track of, and connect your objects. I think it is a testament to the DPLA vision, that they are using JSON-LD, a very structured, and forward leaning vision of how we connect, not just digital objects, but also digital representations of the very physical objects in our world.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to make sure I spend time each month, to at least looking through the <a href="http://dp.la/info/developers/codex/">DPLA API ecosystem</a>, keeping an eye on what they are up to with their API platform, but I intend to also look through the collections and brainstorm on what is possible via the API&mdash;I encourage you to as well.</p>

        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-danger.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I have read several stories about security breaches in the past couple days, ranging from <a href="http://searchsoa.techtarget.com/tip/API-security-more-critical-as-componentization-grows">exploitation of APIs across the distributed systems we are increasingly depending on</a>, to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/06/another-high-profile-mobile-to-api-security-breach-this-one-at-moonpig-greeting-cards/">no security at MoonPig for their mobile app</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/05/reverse-engineering-of-the-kayak-api-from-the-mobile-app/">the reverse engineering of a popular mobile app&mdash;this time it is the Kayak mobile app</a>.</p>
<p>Maybe I am biased, but I can&rsquo;t help but think, in a world increasingly driven by mobile devices, we need to treat all applications like they are external, get to work seting up a proper API program, and secure all apps the same way, no matter whether they are used for internal, partner, or public usage. Treating internal apps differently, opens things up for a whole world of hurt when internal systems are compromised, and ignoring how public facing your API is, when embedded in a popular mobile  app, goes into the same category.</p>
<p>If you have a single API stack, that ALL of your systems integrations, web, mobile, and device based-apps use, you have established a single surface area youneed to secure. Then, if you are using modern API infrastructure, a surface area that you can monitor, and have established relevant service composition, tailored for internal, partner, and public access of resources, you will be able to stay in tune with your API usage, and identify negatives situations much faster--across all devices.</p>
<p>If you are operating your business on the Internet today (i hope you are), consider treating all your apps as external, no matter where they reside, or who uses them&mdash;your overall architecture will be much healthier, and resilient because off because of it.</p>

<p>I was working in&nbsp;<a href="http://restlet.com/technical-resources/apispark/guide">APISpark</a>, playing around with different approaches to creating APIs for data stores i have in Amazon S3, Github, and in Google Spreadsheets. The cloud API deployment solution allows me to generate APIs from CSV, XML, JSON and spreadsheet stores in these locations, to a central API platform faster than I could even consider doing manually.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;m managing a simple data API I have, I see the option to generate a &ldquo;server skeleton&rdquo; in the toolbar, something that is also available to me when working in the <a href="http://restlet.com/products/restlet-studio/">Restlet Studio</a>. This is one of the benefits of creating machine readable API definitions like <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> or <a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API blueprint</a> of your APIs. Restlet doesn&rsquo;t generate server code for you from your file stores, it generates a machine readable definition of your file source, then lets you generate a &ldquo;server skeleton&rdquo; from that.</p>
<p>Server skeletons are not a fully functioning API for your file store, APISpark gives you that. These server skeletons are just scaffolding in Java or Node.js, that give you a starting framework for deploying an API beyond the Restlet / APISpark platform. You still have to wire things up to the file store, database, or other location of the data store&mdash;it is just the beginning.</p>
<p>I guess my goals with this post is to educate people that it is possible to generate server skeletons from APISpark, using common data sources, but I also just like the name. I have used the term server-side scaffolding, but I like server skeletons better. I think I will keep using it to describe what you can generate server side when you employ API definition formats like <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> or <a href="/admin/blog/API blueprint">API Blueprint</a>.</p>

<p>I was taking another look at the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/dev/api">Reddit API</a>&nbsp;over the weekend, and thought their listing of API endpoints was pretty interesting. They provide two ways of looking at the platform APIs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API Section</strong> - Listing of Reddit APIs by account, apps, links, listings, and other groupings.</li>
<li><strong>oAuth Scope -</strong> Listing of Reddit APIs by the endpoints oAuth scope.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not sure if it is something all APIs should follow, I just thought it was an interesting approach, something I haven&rsquo;t seen in any other API area. Reddit has a number of APIs, I can see if you have specific goals with the API, this might be useful to have API sorted in this way.</p>

<p>In 2015, I will enter the 5th year of API Evangelist. To quote one of my favorite bands--&ldquo;What a Long Strange Trip Its Been&rdquo;.  I couldn&rsquo;t be more thankful for the career choice I made in 2010, and extremely grateful for the partners, and loyal readers I&rsquo;ve established along the way.</p>
<p>This list is very long, but I have to <a href="http://3scale.net">specifically call out 3Scale</a>, and their support of what I do, without them API Evangelist wouldn&rsquo;t be happening, I wouldn&rsquo;t be doing my research, and open projects like <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, and <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a> wouldn&rsquo;t exist&mdash;additionally we wouldn&rsquo;t be having the <a href="https://twitter.com/apistrat">@APIStrat</a> conversation that 3Scale makes happen.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a big year end wrap-up or predictor type of guy, but this doesn&rsquo;t mean I do not spend a lot of time reflecting this time of year. I honestly don&rsquo;t feel like anything has changed for me, I&rsquo;m just as dedicated to my API Evangelist in 2015 as I ever have, and here is what I&rsquo;m focusing on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Storytelling</strong> - Telling stories on my blogs about what the smartest people in the space are doing with APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Research</strong> - Researching how APIs are impacting a variety of industries, government, and even our personal world.</li>
<li><strong>Universities</strong> - I am convinced that the next generation workforce needs to be digitally literate to be successful. </li>
<li><strong>APIStrat &amp; API Days</strong> - Helping facilitate the important tech, business, and political conversations that happen at <a href="http://apistrat.com/">APIStrat</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.apidays.io/">API Days</a>.</li>
<li><strong>APIs.json</strong> - Encourage the use of APIs.json to assist in API discovery, and enable the assembling of the next generation API stacks.</li>
</ul>
<p>While there is a lot more going on, this is my primary focus, and what you will find me doing most of the time in 2015. I will be seriously cutting back my travel, to focus on my research and storytelling. You can find me at APIStrat and API Days events, and at <a href="http://www.defragcon.com/">Defrag</a> and <a href="http://www.gluecon.com/">Gluecon</a>, but beyond that I feel the biggest impact I make is keeping up with the space, telling stories, and publishing research that folks can use.</p>
<p>When it comes to predictions, I&rsquo;m in alignment with 3Scale (once again). I think <a href="http://www.3scale.net/2015/01/api-predictions-2015/">their list of 2015 API predictions</a> is very pragmatic, and provides a healthy view of what 2015 will look, where the most important thing that happens this year, is the steady, healthy growth of the API sector.</p>

<p>I saw a story of yet another security breach related to how mobile phones are using APIs today.&nbsp;<a href="http://ifc0nfig.com/moonpig-vulnerability/">This one is from Paul Price, on his blog </a><a href="http://ifc0nfig.com/">ifc0nfig.com</a>, about the <a href="http://www.moonpig.com/uk/">greeting card site MoonPig</a>.</p>
<p>Paul highlights the not just lack of, but actual absence of security when making API calls to MoonPig, allowing you to impersonate any user, place orders, add/retrieve card information, and any other API driven feature of the mobile application.</p>
<p>MoonPig is looking into it of course:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">

<p>When those of us in the API industry talk about public APIs, many folks think we are talking about APIs like Twitter that have publicly available information, or public APIs that allow for anyone to sign up for the service, when in reality, most of the time we are talking about APIs that use the public Internet for transport.</p>
<p>MoonPig&rsquo;s awareness regarding their API surface area, and complete lack of security is something we are going to see play out, in numerous very public, high profile security breaches in the coming years. There are hundreds if not thousands of companies out there right now who have the same setup, and rely on security through obscurity (nobody has discovered it yet).</p>
<p>I personally <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/27/if-you-have-a-publicly-available-mobile-app-you-have-a-public-api/">recommend treating all APIs used in mobile devices like they are public APIs</a>, with a well defined, very public API definition, bundled with a very public security layer, like oAuth. You can still control who has access to signup and use the API, but one beneficial side effect is you can also treat all internal apps like their are just another user on the API.</p>
<p>This is the benefit of public API. Not the myths you often hear about becoming the next Twilio, but the reality that being public will force you to have a very much more well designed, and secure API, that you acknowledge operates on the open Internet. With this mindset you aren&rsquo;t operating in the shadows, you will begin treat your APIs traffic like is available on the open Internet&mdash;which, well, IT IS!!!</p>
<p>Back to the MoonPig story, look at the <a href="http://ifc0nfig.com/moonpig-vulnerability/">timeline of disclosure at the bottom of Paul's post</a>--he has given them 17 months since he first reported, and they still haven't fixed. OUCH!!</p>

<p>Your company's secret sauce doesn't involve keeping your APIs closed and proprietary&mdash;it is about making them as open and accessible as possible, to the point where even your competition can&rsquo;t help but uses them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m am always amazed at the amount of effort some companies put into hiding their API interface away, making me register before I can see anything, and dig through the SDK to even understand an APIs surface area.</p>
<p>If you have a public API, or a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/27/if-you-have-a-publicly-available-mobile-app-you-have-a-public-api/">publicly available mobile app, you have a public API</a>&mdash;put it out there. Be loud and proud of your API designs (if you aren&rsquo;t, then we should have another discussion), make them front and center, within two clicks of your developer landing page.</p>
<p>If you are worried about someone copying your interface, and re-using it in their own API designs, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you are in the wrong business</span>. In the API space, this is good. Think AWS EC2 and S3. Everyone under the sun has copied their interface, even their competition, and what has happened? Oh, they are the dominant player in an entirely new way of doing business--using APIs.</p>
<p>If you think your API surface area, aka the naming, description, and order of your API endpoints, parameters, and data models, is your secret sauce, you are wrong. It is how you deliver within that framework, and the services, support, and other building blocks you provide in support of the interface.</p>
<p>Please stop hiding your APIs, put them out there where everyone can find them.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/01/05/what-exactly-is-apisjson/">What Exactly Is APIs.json?</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">05 Jan 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://apisjson.org/"><img style="padding: 25px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/apis-json/apisdotjson.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>As I travel around talking to folks about APIs, I spend as much time as I can, educating folks about <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>. In the course of my evangelism, I&rsquo;m constantly reminded how little people, who have even heard, and read about APIs.json, really understand about what it actually is. With this in mind, I will be regularly publishing examples of what APis.json is, to help on-board everyone to Steve (<a href="https://twitter.com/njyx">@ngynx</a>), and mine vision for <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>.</p>
<p>APIs.json is an open format, in partnership between <a href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a> and <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, to help API providers make their APIs more discoverable, assist API brokers in aggregating multiple APIs deemed valuable within specific industries, and ultimately empowering API consumers in finding exactly the APIs they need to be successful. Our mission is to make the process of API discovery as portable as we can, enabling it to live on any website, and be found in open search engines like <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a>.</p>
<p>APIs.json is a machine-readable description of your company, and its associated API resources. For each API listed, you give it a name, description, and supporting properties, which may be as simple as providing a link to your documentation, or be as complex as providing a link to a machine readable API definition in the Swagger or API Blueprint format. One APIs.json detail, that I feel many technologists overlook, is that this isn&rsquo;t just discovery in a hypermedia context, this could only be about the discovery of your pricing or maybe just the terms of service page (I know, a hypermedia format can descibe this, but I think you are missing an intermediary step to get the space there!)</p>
<p>If you need an example of APIs.json file, a good place to start is the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/apis.json">APIs.json for APIEvangelist.com</a>, this provides a good default example of APIs.json working within a single domain. If you want to better understand how an <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/10/exploring-the-possibilities-of-being-an-api-broker/">API broker</a> may use to build API collections, take a look at the <a href="http://utility-stack.apievangelist.com/apis.json">APIs.json for my utility stack</a>, which is a collection of APIs from various locations, brought together to serve a specific purpose. Beyond that, take a look at the <a href="http://theapistack.com">700+ APIs.json files I&rsquo;ve created for top APIs as part of my API Stack</a>&mdash;hopefully this will help you see it in action across hundreds of API resource.</p>
<p>Our goal is to encourage <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>EVERY</strong></span> API provider to publish an APIs.json in the root of their public domain(s), but it can also be used in the same way for private APIs, so don't get hung up on the public aspect of all of this. Beyond these early implementations, I want people to also build <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/11/exposing-dictionaries-from-my-api-collections/">API collections</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/17/api-virtual-stack-composition-like-the-absolut-drinks-data-api/">virtual stacks of the APIs</a> for use in their own projects, beginning the process of building some valuable definitions of th emost used APIs in use today. Please join this evolution API discovery, and publish your own <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json file</a>&mdash;I appreciate the help.</p>

        <span class="post-date">05 Jan 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-reverse.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p>I am beginning to track on reverse engineering API story that I come across, so if you find any, feel free to share my way. If you aren&rsquo;t familiar with this growing trend, I&rsquo;m talking about the reverse engineering of APIs from popular mobile apps, specifically in situation where the company doesn&rsquo;t have a public API or developer presence.</p>
<p>APIs are driving the mobile applications tht we are increasingly depending on, but for some reason in 2015 not all companies expose, or share information about this API surface area with the public. The latest story I came across in this trend is <a href="http://www.shubhro.com/2014/12/18/reverse-engineering-kayak-mitmproxy/">the reverse engineering of the Kayak API using mitproxy</a>.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, <a href="https://www.kayak.com/labs/api/search/">there was a public Kayak API,</a> but somewhere along the way it went away. There tends to be a lot of misconceptions around how to conduct a public API presence, and when coupled with the ignorance around the tech, business, and politics of APIs, you see a lot of failed public API attempts--that quietly go away.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m continuing to track on this because I think this is a security, and privacy conversation that will continue to unfold in the public sphere, whether we want it to or not. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/27/if-you-have-a-publicly-available-mobile-app-you-have-a-public-api/">If your APIs are driving a publicly available mobile app, you have public APIs</a>. Period. You might as well treat these APIs like they are public. I&rsquo;m not saying you have to be the next Twitter--I&rsquo;m saying your company needs to get educated on modern technological, business, and legal approaches to making resources available over the open Internet.</p>
<p>You do not have to open up your APIs to the general public, but your API surface area is public, and you should be transparent about how you operate them, how you onboard partners, how data flows publicly via your API pipes, and how you manage the security and privacy of your network. This is a theme you will hear more from me, alongside every reverse engineer story, security and break of a popular mobile app, until more companies possess a public API developer area that properly addresses the tech, business, and politics of their public digital footprint.</p>

<p>I am spending a lot of time lately reviewing Internet of Things (IoT) providers, as I work on a white paper for Gigaom. There are some very interesting approaches to APIs out there in IoT-land, and I&rsquo;m starting to get a feel for some of the patterns, trends, and habits of how IoT providers are approaching their developer efforts.</p>
<p>One pattern I see a lot, and can only assume it comes out of the hardware side of engineering, is a focus on programming language when you talk about your API--something I recommend shifting away from. In the world of web APIs, the focus on the interface, and what it does, and actual programming languages are abstracted away, and provided merely as samples, libraries, and SDKs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing that in the mind of developers who are building APIs for devices, they are approaching APIs from their legacy SDK point of view, and there really isn&rsquo;t any decoupling of thought based upon web APIs. For these engineers, I can&rsquo;t emphasize enough, the importance of separating your interface, from your SDKs, and when you craft language about your API, you generalize the API speak, and keep language specific elements strictly in the support areas for those specific SDKs.</p>
<p>You never know, it might be that one Go developer who builds the perfect connector for your device, or some scientist wielding Python, who integrates a sensor into their work, and then things go viral. The chances that this will happen is less likely if you are just talking about the one or two programming languages that you (the platform) are familiar with.</p>

        <span class="post-date">30 Dec 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/bw-speed-limit-blank.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>After giving some recent attention to the <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/">Twitter API ecosystem</a>, a place where I always learn a lot, I&rsquo;m shifting up my API rate limit building block, in my list of <a title="API Management" href="http://management.apievangelist.com">API management resources</a>. If you aren&rsquo;t familiar with my concept of &ldquo;building blocks&rdquo;, in 2010 I started looking at the top APIs, and tracking on the common &ldquo;building blocks&rdquo; these providers are using to successfully operate their API platform. As I go into 2015, I&rsquo;m still refining, and adding to this list, in hopes of establishing a <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">common list of building blocks, that any API provider can consider as they are designing, and operating their own platforms</a>.</p>
<p>Until now, I had a single building block, underneath a category I titled &ldquo;service levels&rdquo;, which I called the rate limit page. My intent with this building block is to help API providers understand the importance of sharing details on how they rate limit API access, and publish it to a single page for developers to use when on-boarding, and throughout their API integration life-cycle. After seeing how Twitter handles their rate limit, which includes this overview page on rate limiting, I&rsquo;m now adding two new building blocks, and putting all of them under new category titled &ldquo;Rate Limiting&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I now have three rate limiting related API building blocks I recommend API providers consider when designing their platform:</p>
<table style="padding-left: 25px;" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="3" width="90%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="125" align="center" valign="top"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/building-blocks/bw-speed-limit.jpeg" alt="" width="70" /></td>
<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>Rate Limits Page</strong>&nbsp;- Developers need to understand what the limitations of API usage are upfront. Rate limiting an throttling of API access has become commonplace to manage security, and resource load. This building block is about providing a single page explaining how this process works, setting expectations with API consumers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="125" align="center" valign="top"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/building-blocks/bw-documentation-inline-rate-limits.png" alt="" width="100" /></td>
<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>Rate Limit Information Inline In Docs</strong>&nbsp;- In addition to a rate limits page, explaining information about limitations on API usage, some API providers like Twitter are including rate limits within API documentation. With this approach, each API endpoint has its related rate limits published alongside other details.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="125" align="center" valign="top"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/building-blocks/bw-rate-limit-api.png" alt="" width="100" /></td>
<td align="left" valign="middle"><strong>Account Rate Limit API</strong>&nbsp;- As API usage grows the need to be able to programmatically manage your account is increasing. Some API platforms also provide APIs for the management of platform operations. It makes sense that API providers should also offer an API for getting rate limit details for their respect account and apps.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>As with all of my building block recommendations, it is up to you the API provider, to decide what you want to offer, but I recommend considering all three of these rate limit building blocks essential. Providing details on API rate limiting is critical in building trust with new, and existing API consumers, and as the API space continues to grow, the need for automated account management tools, like an API for rate limiting is only going to increase. If you adopt these practices of leading providers now, you have the competitive advantage over other APIs.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/06/29/twitter-continues-to-restrict-access-to-our-tweets/">I don&rsquo;t always agree with Twitter&rsquo;s approach to managing their API</a>, but their ecosystem is always a great place to learn. I personally consider Twitter on of the most important APIs out there, and feel that API providers can learn a lot from the way Twitter approaches their operations. Rate limits are one of the most politically polarizing areas of API operations, and an area that can turn bad real fast, without the proper communication. Something that I think Twitter has worked very hard on addressing, and you can see it in their <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/rate-limiting">rate limit page</a>, the rate limit information available <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/application/rate_limit_status">within the documentation for each endpoint, and via an API rate limit API</a>&mdash;deep. ;-)</p>
<p><em><strong>P.S. </strong>As I'm linking up this story, I see Twitter also has a <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/rate-limits">Rate Limit Chart</a> page. Maybe a fourth building block, or just go on the rate limit main page?</em></p>

<p>When you first land on any <a href="https://www.etsy.com/developers/">API developer landing page</a>, the impression you get, can be one of the most important aspects of on-boarding with an API that I know of. More time than not, I'm pretty confused when I land on the landing page of APIs, being forced to look for what I need to get up and running with API what an API does, and how I will have to integrate with it.</p>
<p>Anytime I come across an API landing page, where I'm immediately given the best possible first impression I can image, I have to showcase. This just happened while taking another look at the Etsy API, which I found refreshingly simple--yet complete.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.etsy.com/developers/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/etsy-first-impressions.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>Everything on the <a href="https://www.etsy.com/developers/">Etsy API developer landing page</a> has a purpose in assisting me during on-boarding with the Etsy API. To better understand this in action, let's look at the handful of essential API management building blocks available on the Etsy home page.</p>
<p>When I land at etsy.com/developers/, immediately I&rsquo;m given a Flexible Messaging Area (FMA), telling me what is possible! It is not just one simple message, as I advocate for constantly, it is a slideshow of multiple, simple messages. #winning</p>
<p><strong>What Does The API Do?</strong><br /> Beyond understand what the Etsy API does in 250 characters or less, I get a prominent link to the API documentation, discussion around the API, and the terms of use for the API&mdash;-BOOM, everything I need. Way to give me exactly what I need so far to get up and running, while also getting out of the way.</p>
<p><strong>How Do I On-Board With An API?</strong><br /> Next, there is a pretty clear blue highlighted box, that helps me understand the connection between my Etsy seller account, and registering as a developer. I&rsquo;m given what I need to register as a developer, and also configure my Etsy shop for proper integration.</p>
<p><strong>Do I Actually Need To Integrate Myself?</strong><br /> After than, I&rsquo;m asked if I am look for Etsy App? Maybe that is all I need. I don&rsquo;t actually need to integrate with Etsy myself, I&rsquo;m look to see if the integration I need has already been done. I just need an application to meet my needs&mdash;nice use of an application showcase Etsy.</p>
<p><strong>Work At Etsy - See current openings!</strong><br /> I&rsquo;ll let you in on a little secret. API ecosystem are often used for talent acquisition. shhhhhh!!! So, Etsy having a section on the home page about working at Etsy, just makes sense. If you are finding yourself in the Etsy Developer area, you are probably a little more curious than the average visitor, and quite possibly someone that Etsy might consider hiring.</p>
<p><strong>Storytelling: Code As Craft</strong><br /> I&rsquo;m a loyal fan of Etsy&rsquo;s Code As Craft blog, so I&rsquo;m not going to knock the fact that their home page blog widget isn&rsquo;t performing as expected. I&rsquo;m guessing normally I would see the last 3 posts from the blog, which in my opinion is essential operations for ANY API landing page. I&rsquo;m sure the Etsy one will be up and running as normal shortly. ;-)</p>
<p><strong>Everything I Need To Keep Me Connected To The Entire Etsy Platform</strong><br /> Providing a complete picture of platform operations is essential for any online service provider. When I&rsquo;m on your main website, I shouldn&rsquo;t have to work to hard to find your API or developer area, and vice versa, I do not want to have to work to get back to the main website, and other sections of a site. Etsy provides what I need to search and browse Etsy, and register or sign into my primary account&mdash;directly from the API developer area.</p>
<p>What started as a pretty straightforward review of an API--routine going back through my list of APis I monitor--ended up being surprisingly good first impression of an API, I've been to several times before.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m always working to help API providers understand the importance of designing their API developer portals, with a larger audience in mind. Not everyone who visits your portal, will be the one integrating with your API, and providing information for non-developers about the value delivered via API resources, can go a long ways to reach the media, and decision makers at companies who will be potentially be making decision around integrating with a service.</p>
<p>I look at a lot of API portals, and always enjoy the ones that speak to the widest possible audience. I also enjoy when there are entire sections dedicated to providing tools and resources for non-developers. One example of this, that I found recently is available over at the<a href="https://www.rev.com/api"> transcription and translation platform from Rev</a>, on the <a href="https://www.rev.com/api/zapier">page they have dedicated to Zapier</a>. I&rsquo;ve <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/24/showcasing-your-api-integrations-with-other-platforms/">written before about companies referencing their IFTTT and Zapier integration</a>, but I think Rev&rsquo;s approach needs highlight because they provide a full page, with actual links to specific types of integrations.</p>
<p>Rev provides some valuable &nbsp;information on what Zapier is, what you can do with Rev and Zapier, and actually walks you through how to actually setup this up, on a page that is given the same prominence as the API documentation (important!).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rev.com/api/zapier"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/rev/rev-zapier.png" alt="" width="550" align="middle" /></a></p>
<p>Rev provides you with direct links to put Rev to work, by transcribing from YouTube and Vimeo, and workflows for putting these transcripts on Dropbox, Google Drive or Box.  You can click on links that take you to the detail page on Zapier, where you can get up and running with the recipe. I <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">added Zapier as a building block a while back</a>, but I really feel that it is quickly becoming an essential building block, something all providers should be considering in 2015.</p>
<p>I think it is really important to provide ready-to-go reciprocity tools for any API platform. I also think it is important to show them alongside API documentation and the other tools meant specifically for developers. This is the power of web API over historic API approaches, in that APIs aren&rsquo;t just for developers. Web APIs exist to provide quick and dirty solutions to problems that anyone faces in their business or personal worlds, and I think Rev&rsquo;s use of Zapier represents this very well.</p>

<p>I had someone ask me, if out of the 3<a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/companies.html">0 API reciprocity providers I track on</a>, if I knew if one of them offered white or private label services. I couldn&rsquo;t confidently say whether or not any of them did, and as I do with my other questions, the best way to find out, is to put it out into the universe, and see whether or not one of the providers will let me know, or one of them will do it.</p>
<p>It would make sense for companies like <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a> to offer a solution that would allow for any company to resell their services, and offer specialty versions of their API reciprocity, interoperability, and automation services. As more companies are operating online, spread across various cloud environments, the need for ETL in the cloud, or like I prefer to call them, <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/">API reciprocity services</a>, is only going to increase.</p>
<p>Not all companies will want to use a Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions, and would prefer operating on-premise, and like to offer the services to their partners, or possibly their customers--opening up the need to brand it themselves. If you know one of the API reciprocity providers that offer anything like this, or plan on doing it, let me know. I have some people who have been asking for it, and would be happy to tell more stories about it.</p>

<p>I'm reviewing the business models of many of the top API platforms over the last couple of weeks, and I&rsquo;m seeing some pretty interesting approaches to <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com">API monetization</a>. As I look through each API, I see that some platforms don&rsquo;t have their API monetization strategy together at all, while others are following the pretty proven &ldquo;cloud utility&rdquo; model handed down from providers like AWS, and then I see some who are continuing to standardize how we pay for, and monetize APIs--which makes me happy.</p>
<p>One <a href="http://www.convertapi.com/prices">interesting pricing page I reviewed over the holidays</a>, was from the <a href="http://www.convertapi.com">file conversion API, ConvertAPI</a>. They have a credit based API monetization approach, allowing you to buy a certain amount of credits on a monthly basis, or make one-time basis. Each area offers four tiers, allowing for the purchase of credits at a various rates. One thing I found curious though, is that your credits purchased monthly do not roll over, where your one time purchases do&mdash;I will have to think about the pros / cons of this more, before I comment.</p>
<p>The ConvertAPI also has a "<a href="http://www.convertapi.com/prices#CreditsCostTable">credits cost table</a>", providing an overview of how credits actually translate into actual API calls. Many file conversion APIs use a one-to-one rate for making API calls, while others cost 2, 3, or even 5 credits per each API call. I like this approach to defining API costs, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/11/12/an-api-for-developers-to-access-their-api-account-information/">when your API developer account includes a API for monitoring</a> account levels, it <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/02/a-market-for-api-developer-credits/">starts getting us closer to the API pricing standardization</a>, and the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/16/with-number-of-apis-continuing-to-grow-account-automation-will-be-key/">automation we will need to continue the growth of the API economy</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m finding a lot of individual API monetization stories as I go through this latest round of research. I&rsquo;m thinking I will have to spend a couple of weeks in February or March of 2015, step back and look at the monetization strategies of the <a href="http://theapistack.com/">700+ companies I&rsquo;m tracking on</a>, and hopefully provide some better analysis of where we stand with this vital layer of the API industry. Along with the work I&rsquo;m doing to encourage companies to create machine readable API definitions for their APIs, accompanied with machine readable licensing using <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>, I want to help encourage the standardization of API pricing&mdash;then who knows, maybe someday API pricing can be machine readable, allowing us to make real-time decisions on the APIs we use based upon cost.</p>

<p>As I look through the API efforts of various providers, I&rsquo;m always looking for the little things that can make on-boarding, and sustained integration with an API as frictionless as possible. One of the <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">building blocks that I recommend API providers employ</a> in their operations, is a page that explains API rate limits&mdash;providing vital information on how API resources are throttled (or not).</p>
<p>An improvement on the standard rate limit building block, can be seen at Twitter. <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/application/rate_limit_status">Inline in the Twitter API documentation</a>, there are details about rate limiting for that specific endpoint. This way, as you are learning about each endpoint, you can also understand what limitations are in place. A small addition that could prove critical, for any API provider, especially Twitter, who has some of the most complex rate limiting of any API I know of.</p>
<p>At first glance, something small like including rate limit information within each API endpoint documentation may seem insignificant, but think of it like bobsledding or swimming in the olympics, where the slightest adjustment can reduce friction in just the right place&mdash;giving you the competitive advantage you need. Taking a fresh look at the building block(s) Twitter uses around API rate limiting, is expanding my own thoughts on how any API provider can approach their own rate limiting, and represents why I keep an eye on API pioneers like Twitter, even if I don&rsquo;t always agree with 100% of their decisions around platform operations.</p>
<p><em><strong>P.S. </strong>Did you notice the picture is of the rate limiting information, within the rate limit API endpoint? That will be another story, as part of my expansion of thought in the area of rate limiting.</em></p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Dec 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-open.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>APIs are a really tough concept to help folks on-board with. I have come to realize that people see APIs very differently, and most of the time, I think this can be a good thing. In a perfect world it would be nice if everyone followed the same standards, and used only the best API patterns, when designing their APIs. This isn't the world we have, and to help better engge within the world we have, I am working to tell stories of this dysfunctional but beautiful API space we have accidently created for ourselves, develop visuals that help us better quantify things, and potentially give little nudges where I can to move things in a better direction.</p>
<p>When I hear most technologists talk about APIs, I feel many are exclusively looking through a client / server lens. Your APIs is your backend server architecture, and then your client architecture that will be used to connect APIs to websites, mobile applications, devices, and other systems. When I try to talk about API copyright, projects like <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>, and <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, or educate folks about modern approaches to API design, deployment, management and integration in this client / server mindset, it can be very difficult to articulate some very important concepts. Not all developers, software architects, and business leaders are familiar with this very important, and the rapidly evolving surface area being defined by API.</p>
<p>To help convey some of my thoughts about this very important layer of the API space, I've created some new visuals that I can use in stories, slide decks, and my research reports. First I want to elevate the discussion beyond just client / server architecture, and highlight the importance of the API definition surface area that is present in the middle.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/api-architecture/api-architecture-one.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>When you are designing, developing, managing, and integrating with APIs, you use some very specific languages for developing your server architecture. We use programming languages like PHP, Python, Ruby ,Node.js and other languages to develop the server side of our API. In most scenarios, companies choose the programming language they are already using across their business, developing all server side architecture in a common language.</p>
<p>Inversely, when it comes to client side architecture, companies should work to provide as many possible programming languages possible, providing code samples, libraries, and SDKs for all popular platforms. This is the promise of simple web APIs, is that a well designed API will abstract away any language specific details present on the server, making it accessible in any programming language. Then the good API providers encourage integration, by providing a wide variety of client tooling as they possibly can, to make integration as frictionless as possible.</p>
<p>In the middle, for the API definition layer, modern API developers are defining their interfaces, using machine readable formats like <a href="http://swagger.io/">Swagger</a>, <a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>, and <a href="http://raml.org/">RAML</a>. Providing a machine readable definition of an API is proving to be critical for just about every aspect of the API life-cycle.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/api-architecture/api-architecture-two.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>If you have a public API, or publicly available mobile or Internet of Things apps, you have a public API interface. This layer exists on the open Internet, and as we go into 2015, this layer for all public APIs should be well defined. Developers are using this definition to integrate with their existing systems, generating client tools, and are powering testing, monitoring, and other critical aspects of API integration.</p>
<p>Your server architecture is critical to API operations, and while I'm not in the business of telling pople how to license server side code, I will encourage anyone to make sure and at least apply a license, and I personally believe in using as liberal of license as you possibly can. When it comes to your client architecture, I will get a little more pushy about how things should be licensed--you are asking someone to integrate your API into their business, existing applications, and the code you provide should allow for as much flexibility as possible, not imposing restrictions.</p>
<p>This approach also applies to the API definition layer. Your API definition should be as accessible, open, and flexible as possible. You are expecting users to bake your Application Programming Interface (API) into their worlds, and this surface area is the point at which your two business meet. You can keep your server side code as a "secret sauce", but your API definition, and client architecture should be as open as possible.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/api-architecture/api-architecture-three.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>I do not think that copyright should be able to be applied to API definitions, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/06/02/helping-eff-urge-the-courts-to-block-copyright-claims-in-oracle-v-google-api-fight/">my work with the EFF on the Oracle vs. Google Java API copyright case</a> reflects this. With that said, we don't live in a perfect world, and embracing the one we have, I encourage applying a Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC-BY-SA</a> or <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/cc0">CC0</a> license to your API definitions, regardless of whether or not you use Swagger, API Blueprint, or RAML. After you do, I encourage you to <a href="http://apicommons.org/index.html">add it to the API Commons</a>.</p>
<p>I've had conversations with people who claim that their API surface area is their secret sauce. First if it supports a public mobile app, is used on websites, or provides integration of external systems, and devices over the open Internet--it ain't a secret! Second your sauce should be in the delivery of services behind your API surface area, the actual wording, order, and other aspects of your definition should be open for anyone to use!</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/api-architecture/api-architecture-four.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>It is incredibly important that this layer of the API space is well defined, front and center in our conversations, and remains as openly accessible as possible. If you need a real world analogy to better understand the openness of this layer, <a href="http://apivoice.com/2014/05/23/restaurant-menus-as-analogy-for-api-copyright/">read my API copyright -- restaurant menu story</a>. Your menu is not your business, it will be the service behind the menu that truly defines your company.</p>
<p>The best example of this in action, within the API space, is around the Amazon S3 and EC2 APIs. If these API definitions were not openly available, and were protected under copyright, would cloud computing have ever happened? Would we have an ecosystem of tooling like Eucalyptus, to Chrome or Firefox extensions, that has helped us deploy global infrastructure, and build applications that have come to define cloud computing.</p>
<p>Please work with me to make sure the most important layers of the API space stay as open, and accessible as possible.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m profiling all the <a href="http://theapistack.com/">700+ companies I monitor across the space</a>, going through each one and defining their API program, evaluating the tech, business and politics of their operations. Part of this process is creating a Swagger definition for each API. I&rsquo;m not deeply concerned with getting each API definition 100%, unless I'm directly integrating with the aPI. For this round I&rsquo;m looking at defining just the surface area of the API, including each endpoint, headers, parameters, and body format, and leaving the underlying data model for another time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">publishing all of my API definitions to the API Stack Github repository</a>. I&rsquo;m using this as a staging area before I publish them to <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a>.

<p>Feel free to use any of my Swagger specifications, all that I ask is if you update, or add to them, please commit back to the repository so everyone can benefit. Additionally if you have any Swagger definitions for your own APIs, or other public APIs that I do not have in my listings, please share. It is extremely important that all public API endpoints are defined in a machine readable format. I don&rsquo;t care if you use Swagger, API Blueprint or RAML, just make sure your APIs have a definition, and it is shared publicly. If it is one of your designs, make sure and also add to API Commons.</p>
<p>When I reach a critical mass of <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">API definitions in the API Stack Github repo</a>, I will publish a story on apievangelist.com announcing they are there, and do incremental pushes to APIs.io, so that these value APIs are part of its open index, allowing you to build API collections, and even your open API search engine. Its important that we all <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/21/making-sure-the-most-important-layers-of-api-space-stay-open/">work to define this layer of the API space, and work to keep it as open, and machine readable as possible</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m developing a common API for all the APIs I deploy via Docker containers, meaning that each API that I design as a Docker image, will have an API to control all aspects of deployment, and its operations. I will be keeping most of the surface area available in <a href="https://docs.docker.com/reference/api/docker_remote_api/#v116">current version of the Docker API</a>, but I'm thinking I will add a handful of endpoints, and maybe alter a couple of the existing Docker defined endpoints to better meet my needs.</p>
<p>To support my work, I need a Swagger 2.0 definition for the v1.16 of the Docker API. I wish everyone would create machine readable API definitions for their APIs by default, but until that is the norm, I will be creating myself. I&rsquo;m getting pretty good at writing scrape scripts for harvesting API documentation (if they are well formed).</p>
<p>This Swagger definition not 100% complete, but <a href="http://theapistack.com/data/docker/docker-remote-api-swagger.json">here is what I have so far of a Swagger 2.0 representation of the Docker v1.16 API</a>. Its on Github, so if you use this definition, and fix anything, or add parts and pieces i didn't, please submit back, so everyone can benefit from it. I haven't completed the data model for the endpoints, but I'm storing the JSON responses for each endpoint, and just need to set aside some time to finish.</p>
<p>You can find the <a href="http://theapistack.com/data/docker/docker-remote-api-swagger.json">Swagger 2.0 definition for the Docker v1.16 API on The API Stac</a>k, where <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">I publish all my Swagger definitions for the APIs</a> I integrate with, and monitor as part of my research. I&rsquo;m adding definitions all the time, so check back often, and if you have any API definitions I do not, feel free to fork the repo, and submit them via pull request. I&rsquo;m not just looking for Swagger, I'd love to have any format you generate machine readable API definitions in&mdash;it is important that all of this layer of the API space, is accessible, and machine readable, so please help make it so.</p>
