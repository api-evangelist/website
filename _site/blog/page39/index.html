        <span class="post-date">02 Feb 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://developer.apievangelist.com/core-apis.html"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/swagger/swagger-interactive-api-docs.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I was having a Twitter conversation with John Sheehan(<a href="https://twitter.com/johnsheehan">@johnsheehan</a>) about the easiest way to generate interactive API documentation this weekend, without getting all tangled up in having to get into the weeds of <a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui">Swagger UI</a>. I love me some Swagger UI, something I think has transformed how we engage with APIs, but the JavaScript for it can be inaccessible, and difficult to customize--to say the least.</p>
<p>There are other UI solutions to API documentation, projects like <a href="https://github.com/tripit/slate">Slate from Tripit</a>, from <a href="https://readme.io/">Readme.io</a>, and some cool <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/17/adding-data-visualization-layer-to-interactive-api-documentation/">UI stuff over at OpenFDA</a>, but really I haven&rsquo;t seen much evolution beyond Swagger UI. Sure, <a href="http://apiary.io">Apiary.io</a> has a great UI, but it isn&rsquo;t the portable, customizable vision I have in my head (they are working on this, BTW). I <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/24/someone-please-build-my-open-interactive-portable-and-visual-api-documentation-toolkit/">envision a whole gallery of simple, UI templates that you can choose from</a>, driven by machine readable <a href="http://swagger.io/">Swagger</a> or <a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint </a>API definitions.</p>
<p>Looks like the <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">gov hackers over at 18F</a> feel the same way, and are working on something like this&mdash;"<a href="https://github.com/shawnbot/swagger-static">a suite of tools and templates that faciliate the generation of static, human-readable documentation to replace SwaggerUI</a>&rdquo;. <a href="https://github.com/shawnbot">Shawn Allen</a>, has created two repos:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/shawnbot/swagger-template">swagger-template</a>, just some HTML files that should theoretically be useful for generating static HTML documentation for a Swagger-compliant API.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/shawnbot/swagger-enhance">swagger-enhance</a>, a little Node utility for grabbing a Swagger API's JSON and "enhancing" it with JSON data from each of its own endpoints (confusingly, "apis", in Swagger parlance).</li>
</ul>
<p>It makes me happy to see some brainstorming to push the conversation forward. I&rsquo;m able to deploy Swagger UI pretty quickly to support my APIs, using Github Pages, but when it comes to extending, and transforming the UI, I hit a wall pretty quickly. I've created some custom UI solutions, to help me manage my own infrastructure, driven by Swagger, but nothing that contributes to the larger conversation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to see API design, deployment, and integration tools I depend on like <a href="http://studio.restlet.com/#/">Restlet Studio</a>, and <a href="http://www.getpostman.com/">Postman</a> provide more support for easy deployment of UI elements, driven by machine readable API formats like Swagger and API Blueprint. Making API documentation more interactive with Swagger UI was an important step forward, but we are ready for the next step in the evolution of API UI generation.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-conductor.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></p>
<p>As I work to r<a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">edefine my world using microservices</a>, I have this sudden realization how important my API management infrastructure is to all of this. Each one of my microservices are little APIs that do one thing, and do it well, relying on my API management infrastructure to know who should be accessing, and exactly how much of the resource they should have access to.</p>
<p>My note API shouldn&rsquo;t have to know anything about my users, it is just trained to ask my API management infrastructure, if each user has proper credentials to accessing the resource, and what the service composition will allow them to do with it (aka read, write, how much, etc.) My note API does what it does best, store notes, and relies on my API management layer to do what it does best--manage access to the microservice.</p>
<p>This approach to API management has llowed me to deploy any number of microservices, using my API management infrastructure to compose my various service packages&mdash;this is called service composition. <a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">I employ 3Scale infrastructure for all my API / microservice management</a>, which I use to define different service tiers like retail, wholesale, internal, and other service specific groupings. When users sign up for API access, I add them to one of the service tiers, and my API service composition layer handles the rest.</p>
<p>Modern API management service composition is the magic hand-waiving in my microservice orchestration, and without it, it would be much more work for me to compose using microservices in this containerized API world that is unfolding.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Feb 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://logomaker.apievangelist.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/logo-2015-02-02-11-46-41.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>In 2010, when I started API Evangelist, I sat down to create a logo, and after six hours of frustration in photoshop, I eventually just typed out my logo as a basic JSON representation, kind of as a joke, which I eventually planned on changing, but it stuck.</p>
<p>With the latest batch of t-shirts I've ditched the "logo" portion, but will keep this legacy version floating around, here and there for nostalgic purposes. Along the way, I've added what I consider the function version of the logo, which I use for each of my research sites.</p>
<p>I'm starting so many new research areas lately, I decided to create a logomaker API, so I can make new logos, and anyone else can make their own as well. There are three API endpoints for the <a href="http://logomaker.apievangelist.com/">API Evangelist logomaker API</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Single</strong> -&nbsp;<a href="http://logomaker.api.apievangelist.com/single/?value=[value]" target="_blank">http://logomaker.api.apievangelist.com/single/?value=[value]</a></li>
<li><strong>Key/Value</strong> -&nbsp;<a href="http://logomaker.api.apievangelist.com/keyvalue/?key=[key]&amp;value=[value]" target="_blank">http://logomaker.api.apievangelist.com/keyvalue/?key=[key]&amp;value=[value]</a></li>
<li><strong>Function</strong> -&nbsp;<a href="http://logomaker.api.apievangelist.com/function/?name=[name]" target="_blank">http://logomaker.api.apievangelist.com/function/?name=[name]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The API is completely open, but I will be cleaning out the images each day, so if you truly want to keep one, save it locally. Have fun playing. I will actually be using it to generate headers for my research sites. If you want to use any of my logos, make sure you follow my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/branding-guidelines.html">branding guidelines</a>. ;-)</p>

API skeptics also give me material for stories, so I thoroughly enjoy coming across them, and telling these stories is how keep polishing my argument for the next API skeptic encounter at campus IT, at the higher educational institutions that I visit.</span></p>
<p>During the discussion I was posed several interesting questions, and one of them was: why would you ever give students API access to the Student Information System (SIS), and let them build un-sanctioned apps that we will end up have to support?</p>
<p><strong>Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)</strong><br /> FERPA gives students the right to review, control disclosure, and request amendment of their education record. Increasingly this is going beyond just via a web interface, PDF, or printed copies. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/06/01/barack-obama-directs-all-federal-agencies-to-have-an-api/">President Barack Obama mandated that all federal agencies begin providing information in machine readable formats</a>, and many cities and states are putting it into law as well. A student should always have access to their data, and they should be able to choose to do this via campus applications, or be able to obtain a portable copy of their record for storage in a location of their choosing, or possible use within a 3rd party system of their choice&mdash;it's their data. Period.</p>
<p><strong>Un-Sanctioned App Concern Is Just A Red Herring</strong><br />Modern API management infrastructure like <a href="http://www.3scale.net/">3Scale</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://wso2.com/">WSO2</a>, provide an unprecedented level of control over managing API access, requiring secure on-boarding of new developers, the establishment of service composition definitions, which provides rich real-time analytics on how APIs are used, and by whom&mdash;while also seamlessly integrating with existing identity and access management solutions. The university gets to choose who has access to which services, revoke access when abused, while also better understanding how resources are really being accessed and put to use. Ideally this applies to all campus-wide usage, as well as with external 3rd parties&mdash;modern approaches to API-centric operations, include the management of internal, partner, and public resources in this way.</p>
<p><strong>A More Balanced Governance Across Campus Resources</strong><br /> Modern API management was born out of traditional IT governance, but is something that is more focused on giving access and control to the end-users who are the actual owners, of the valuable data, content, and other digital resources being made available.  Legacy campus IT models provide a governance model that involves IT, administrative and faculty stakeholders, but rarely includes the students. APIs give students secure access to their data, and standards like <a href="http://oauth.net/">oAuth</a> opens up the ability for them to have a vote in who has access to their data, with oAuth scope being defined by existing institutional governance efforts. When APIs enter the conversation, governance expands to be more self-service, real-time, and within the control of students, as well as administrators, faculty, and campus IT.</p>
<p><strong>Possibility Of Good Things Happening Closer To The Student</strong><br /> In the current educational environment, where students are often more tech savvy than faculty and administrators, why would we want to eliminate serendipity, and the possibility that new things might happen. Solutions to problems that students actually face everyday, that campus administrator may never think of, because they see technology through a very different lens. The days where IT knows best, regarding what devices, browsers, apps, and websites are optimal for getting things done, are in the past. Shadow IT demonstrates this, where students, and even faculty are using un-sanctioned solutions to get their work done. Campus IT should be empowering students, encouraging a more digitally literate individual who soon will be entering the workforce, not suffocating this.</p>
<p><strong>Easy For Campus IT To Miss The Big Picture</strong><br /> I am a recovering IT administrator, so I understand the challenges a skeptic campus IT administrator faces, but ultimately by restricting access to campus resources just makes your job harder, making you the bottleneck that everyone's so commonly complains about, when it comes to IT. APIs don&rsquo;t create more work for you, it makes you much more agile and nimble in how you integrate systems, build new web and mobile applications, and provide 3rd party vendors access to campus resources&mdash;as well as potentially opening up self-service access to students.</p>
<p>With an API-centric approach you will know exactly who is accessing resources, and how they are using them--in real-time. I&rsquo;m betting that you don&rsquo;t have this visibility across all of your IT resources right now. When I put on my IT director hat, I prefer the API model, because then all resources are self-service, available to only those who <span style="text-decoration: underline;">SHOULD</span> have access, all without them having to talk to me. I&rsquo;m left alone to do what I do best, and can also monitor new signups, real-time usage, and manage support tickets in accordance with wider IT support strategies.</p>
<p>I understand you are a skeptic about APIs being a thing students should have access to, and in reality most students will not care, but there will be a long tail of student users who will do things you never imagined, and potentially change how you look at scheduling, document management, or other staples of campus operations&mdash;something that will never happen if you don&rsquo;t make students a priority when it comes to your digital resource management.</p>

What A Security Risk!</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">31 Jan 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-unhappy.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I went up to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/30/talking-apis-up-at-california-state-university-channel-islands/">California State University Channel Islands the other day to talk APIs with their tech team</a>, and I was happy to find at least one strong API skeptic on the team. API skeptics also give me material for stories, so I thoroughly enjoy coming across them, and telling these stories is how keep polishing my argument for the next API skeptic encounter at campus IT, at the higher educational institutions that I visit.</p>
<p>During the discussion I was asked several interesting questions, the first one was: why would you want to list of your web services (APIs) for your public university, out in the open, via a central portal?? What a security risk!!</p>
<p><strong>Sorry, But Security Through Obscurity Is Not A Strategy</strong><br /> I&rsquo;m sorry, hiding things, and hoping nobody finds them is not a valid IT strategy. You are a public university, and you should have a sophisticated identity and access management, as well as well tight approach to security. If you can&rsquo;t properly secure an API resource available at a public URL, you shouldn&rsquo;t be running campus IT, sorry.  You should be able to provide a public description, of what resources are available, without giving away the farm.</p>
<p><strong>The Feeling You Have &mdash;It Comes From Legacy Power And Control</strong><br /> As an IT professional, if you don&rsquo;t acknowledge that power and control exists within classic IT processes, you are in denial. I&rsquo;ve taken over numerous company IT operations, and there is ALWAYS political struggles between IT and the rest of operations. If you list all digital resources in a single portal, and make them available in a self-service way, it disrupts existing power and control structures. When you make things hard to find, you play a central role in people finding these resources, and you are in power&mdash;adding to decades of legacy stories about IT being a negative force in operations. Self-service access to campus resources is the future, no matter how much you resist.</p>
<p><strong>Centralized  Location To Aggregate All Digital Resources</strong><br /> A centralized API portal provides a single place for anyone to discover or share their digital resources. Like the main website, administrators, faculty, students, parents, and the public will know there is a single place to find machine readable versions of campus resources. API portals are more than just a listing of APIs, it includes documentation, code samples, widgets, buttons, spreadsheet connectors, visualizations, blogs, twitter accounts, and other resources that can turn a simple portal into an active ecosystem where everyone collaborates around campus resources.</p>
<p><strong>Self-Service Access For 3rd Party Vendors Delivering Vital Campus Services</strong><br /> It takes resources to engage with 3rd party vendors on campus, and a single, self-service portal provides a standardized way for vendors to access the institutional resources they need to deliver the services they are bringing to campus operations. There is no reason that IT or departmental contacts should ever be bottlenecks in delivering the information vendors will need. API portals should provide them with the access they need, along with proper identity and access management, and monitoring of exactly how vendors are accessing, and putting campus resources to use (or not).</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/web-services-listing.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>Interoperability Between Higher Educational Institutions</strong><br /> Most higher educational institutions are part of a larger network of institutions, and at the very least have relationships with other schools, in which information, and resources are shared. As with vendors, much of this can be provided via a self-service API portal, where institutions can find the data, content, and other resources they need, able to access only the resources they are supposed to during the fullfillment of established relationships.</p>
<p><strong>Smoother Interactions With Local, State, And Federal Government</strong><br /> Higher educational institutions have regular integration points with local, state, and federal government agencies. Data is reported on a regular basis, back and forth, and a central API portal is excellent for aggregating the commons resources a government agency will be asking for. API portals are not just for student hackers, or 3rd party developers, they are increasingly how government agencies are sharing, and getting what they need to regulate, monitor industry, and govern more effectively.</p>
<p><strong>It Is About People Getting Access To What They Need</strong><br /> Central API portals are about making sure people get access to what they need, and at a public university, this should be priority number one. You have data, content, and other digital resource students, faculty, administrators, vendors, government, parents and alumni need, and because you aren&rsquo;t confident in securing it, from a handful of hackers you are going to hide this away, and forgo all the benefits? I&rsquo;m sorry, the perceived negatives just don&rsquo;t out-weighs the positives. There are proven ways to secure APIs, and for much of university operations, it won&rsquo;t hurt to provide a title, description, and location of a resource, and let identity and access management handle who should be able to get at resources&mdash;or not.</p>
<p><strong>Bringing IT Out of Shadows Across Campus Operations</strong><br /> Security is a concern, and should be front-and-center in all conversations, but it is too often used to hide away insecurities, incompetency, and shortcomings in security, rather than actual address the root of security concerns. If a resource is accessible via Internet protocols, over campus networks, it should be mapped out, with the definition made publicly available in a sensible way. This conversation should involve careful consideration what resource should be public, and what should remain private, with a heavy emphasis on transparency at a public university.</p>
<p>Between 2000 and 2007, we start seeing a shift of IT services into the cloud, and much of this has happened, as un-sanctioned shadow IT, by administrators, faculty, and students looking to get their work done, because IT hasn&rsquo;t been able to keep up.  The cloud evolution of IT has been all API driven, and making IT resources available to the public at Amazon sounded insane at first, but it has changed not just how Amazon operates, but has evolved the entire world deploys software architecture&mdash;using APIs.</p>
<p>There are many great examples of leading companies, making personally identifiable information, banking, healthcare, and other vital data and content available on the open Internet, in a secure way. It is not a security risk to share information, and provide access to your valuable resources, in a central, publicly available portal--if you do it right. Who knows, if you do open up, there may be some unintended consequences, leading to IT being seen as positive influence on the education process, as opposed to the roadblock image it often has on campuses across the country.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/01/31/breaking-down-the-fitbit-apisjson-file/">Breaking Down The Fitbit APIs.json File</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">31 Jan 2015</span>
        <p>The quantified-self API <a href="http://www.fitbit.com">Fitbit</a> recently added an <a href="http://www.fitbit.com/apis.json">APIs.json for their domain</a>. Their usage of APIs.json is a perfect, dead-simple, introductory example of how APIs can start putting APIs.json for their API platform. To help other providers understand, I wanted to take a look at the moving parts of Fitbits APIs.json, and to assist the conversation I labeled each part.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/www_fitbit_com-apis_json.png" alt="" width="95%" align="center" /></p>
<blockquote><strong>A) </strong>The heart of an APIs.json, providing a name, description, image, and tags for API platform and collection.<br /> <strong>B)</strong> The technical details of where this APIs.json came from, which version it is, and when it was created and last modified.<br /> <strong>C) </strong>Similar to the overall APIs.json collection, each API gets a name, description, image, and tags, but also as the default URL people should go to find the API, as well as the base URL actually make calls to the AP, which is used as the API identifier.<br /> <strong>D) </strong>Properties collection for the API. This is where the flexibility in the APIs.json comes in, and you can define any type of URL you wish. Ideally we establish a core set of machine readable properties, but providing human links to blog, documentation, etc are essential too.<br /> <strong>E) </strong>X-blog - a link to the Fitbit blog, providing a direct link that users can use to read the blog.<br /> <strong>F) </strong>X-blog-rss-feed -a link to the RSS feed, providing a machine readable link to stories, and updates for the platform.<br /> <strong>G) </strong>X-github - a link to the official Github account for the Fitbit platform, when you consider the Github API, this becomes a machine readable link to multiple aspects of API operations.<br /> <strong>H) </strong>X-twitter -  a link to the official Twitter account for the Fitbit platform, which again, using the Twitter API, this becomes a machine readable resources for accessing platform communications, updates, and resources.<br /> <strong>I) </strong>Contact information for the Fitbit API team, which they route you to a forum. Some platforms put their Twitter handle here, and others put an email or phone number.<br /> <strong>J) </strong>Maintainer for the APIs.json, which since it is Fitbit, helps provide authority, showing this APIs.json comes from the source, and is not a collection built by someone else, which includes the Fitbit API.<br /></blockquote>
<p>The initial APIs.json from Fitbit is simple, and while there is potential for additions like a Swagger or API blueprint definition, or maybe terms of services, and client code, would be an excellent start.</p>
<p>So what now? What does this do for Fitbit?</p>
<p>It makes the definition of their API portable. It acts like a sitemap.xml for their API program, allowing search engines like <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a> to index Fitbit along with other APIs. You can also develop embeddable widgets, allowing the API information to be displayed on any site, and using Github and Twitter APis, and the Blog RSS, you could also pull other relevant information for display, and search within the widget, on any website or mobile application.</p>
<p>We are just getting going with APIs.json tooling, that will help add to the benefits of having one. I know of several projects in the works, developing internal APIs.json search engines, directories, and when you include API definitions like Swagger and API Blueprint in your APIs.json, things get even better. I&rsquo;m using APIs.json for microservice discovery, navigation, and indexing, and as a way to connect API interfaces  with containers that deliver on the promise an API is supposed to deliver.</p>
<p>I am seeing more API providers begin to deploy APIs.json for their providers, and I have two of the leading API management providers about to release APIs.json as a native part of their API management workflow, with others in the works. It is good to see APIs like Fitbit see the potential of indexing their API operations with <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, something where the benefits are only going to grow over the coming years, as new tools, and services emerge that depend on APIs.json for engaging in the API economy.</p>

<p>I started doing <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/25/doing-the-research-in-preparation-for-my-patent-on-a-patent-api/">research on API patents recently</a>, and after about 5 days of processing XML files from the US Patent Office, I'm going to stop processing at the year 2004 (way back). This gives me 2005 through present day, and provides more than enough information for me to evaluate the role APIs are playing in the patent process, and inversely how patents are affecting the API space.</p>
<p>In 2004, the XML data files I'm processing start to change, and I'm getting errors, resulting in me having to reconfigure my script, in addition to downloading the numerous, large XML files. I think I have enough of a sampling to start building a wider awareness of what is going on with patents and APIs, I can always come back and download 1995 through 2004.</p>
<p>So far, I have found 16,485 patent applications that had the phrase "application programming interface" in either the title, abstract, or full description for the patent. I found <a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com/patents.html?filter=name">151 patents that specifically mentioned API in the patent title</a>, and <a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com/patents.html?filter=abstract">569 that specifically said it in the abstract</a>. Here is the breakdown by year:</p>

</ul>
<p>I'm going to continue my API patent journey by reading the 151 patents that specifically mentioned API in the patent title, and the 569 that specifically said it in the abstract. From there, I will expand into the other patent applications and try to understand if the API is more hardware API, or more API adjacent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a lot of learning ahead, so I don't want to make to many assumptions early on, but looking at the <a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com/companies.html">list of companies who have filed patents</a>, it becomes very clear to me that if you want to conduct business in the API economy, you are going to have to at least take a defensive patent stance for your APIs, or these companies will bury you in legal attacks.</p>
<p>There are a number of thoughts swirling around in my head around patents, but a few of them that keep floating to the top are around how damaging the antiquated patent process could be to the API economy, and around why there hasn't been much conversation in this area, as the world of APIs has been heating up over last four years.</p>
<p>After I read more of the patents, I'm hoping I'll better understand what companies are up to, and possibly the motivations behind the patents. Then I'll begin making my own assumptions about how positive or negative patents are to the API economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All I can say now, is what a strange world to try and make sense of. In my opinion the concept of patents apply to a very physical world, and much like Creative Commons has helped evolve the world of copyright in an Internet era, we need something to bring patents into a digital world. A conversation that gets even more complicated when you start thinking about the Internet of Things.</p>

APIs.json provides a simple, machine readable way to index the technology, business, and political elements of each microservice I deploy.</p>
<p>As I was auditing the <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">18+ microservices I&rsquo;ve setup for my core operations</a>, I wanted to audit each one, and make sure I had included various elements in each APIs definition, like where developers can onboard, terms of service, and where to find related code samples. To accomplish this, I was able to just compare each microservice APIs.json, with a master APIs.json template I had established while planning my original microservice stack.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes it is just as important to know what is missing, right alongside what is available for all of my microservices, and <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a> is proving to be a simple way of understanding this layer of my API operation at scale.</p>

<p>I spent the day yesterday up in Camarillo, at<a href="http://www.csuci.edu/"> California State University Channel Islands (CI)</a>. Half my time I spent speaking with a mix of folks from the campus tech team about APIs, and the other half I spent learning about video production at the university. I wanted to thank , Chris Mattia (<a href="https://twitter.com/cmmattia">@cmmattia)</a> Director of Academic Technology, CSU Channel Islands, Michael Berman (<a href="https://twitter.com/amichaelberman">@amichaelberman</a>) VP Technology &amp; Communication, California State University Channel, Mikhail Gershovich (<a href="https://twitter.com/mgershovich">@mgershovich</a>) for having me up.</p>
<p>The conversation I had with their tech team around APIs reflected other conversations I&rsquo;ve been having with other higher educational institutions. It was a mix of business and technical talent from the school, ranging from instructional technologists, to front-end, and backend data people. The spectrum of personalities range from the API literate, to API curious, and of course the API skeptic&mdash;which demonstrates their is a healthy balance to the tech team the university, in my opinion.</p>
<p>I walked everyone through the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/12/20/history-of-apis/">history of APIs</a>, and showcased a couple of <a href="http://university.apievangelist.com/universities.html">the other universities putting APIs to work</a>, then I just opened up the conversation to the technology, business, and politics of APIs on campus. The leadership at Channel Islands can see the potential of APIs, but just like every other sensible institution, they have to cautiously evaluate where the low hanging fruit is, get some small API wins, before tackling any larger API projects.</p>
<p>These types of conversations are something I will be encouraging more of in 2015, and I&rsquo;m looking to bring together the 10 institutions I&rsquo;ve had discussions with so far together for an API event, while also opening up invitation other institutions who might want to participate. If you would like to jump start an API discussion at your higher education institution, please let me know.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.apitools.com/">APITools</a> is a simple, <a href="https://github.com/APItools/monitor">open source</a>, API middleware that allows you to &ldquo;track, transform and analyze the traffic between your app and the APIs&rdquo;. With just a few clicks you can proxy any API you use, and when you make calls through the proxy, you get a bunch of valuable  information in return.</p>
<p>One thing APITools does, that is extremely valuable to me, is it generates Swagger definitions, mapping out the surface area of an API, with each call I make. These API definitions have a wide variety of uses for me, ranging from better understanding the API designs of popular services, to providing API search services through open API search engines like <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a>.</p>
<p>If you are regularly developing against a public API, can you take a moment to swap the baseURL with one created in APITools, make all of your calls to the API, then send me a copy of the Swagger definition? I would sure appreciate the help in creating Swagger definitions for all of the popular APIs available today. Don&rsquo;t worry all your work is openly available on both <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">API Stack for re-use and forking by anyone</a>.</p>

<p>I was struggling with <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/28/how-much-api-surface-area-before-it-stops-being-micro/">exactly how much API surface area can exist for a service before it stops being micro</a>&nbsp;the other day, and while I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever find a precise measurement for this, I&rsquo;d like to have a fluid definition that I can use to automatically evaluate, how big an API is.</p>
<p>So, what data can I gather, to help me quantify the surface area of my API? I&rsquo;ll start with each endpoints, then count each verb, parameter, and potential response. Since I use <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> for all of my API definitions, I can easily do this, and I can also understand each API response better because also I have them linked to the underlying data model.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not exactly sure how this surface area definition will work, ultimately I&rsquo;d like to be able to separate verbose APIs by different layers, like the number of endpoints or parameters, or maybe the lack of verbs, or responses (not what is there, but what is missing)--I'm not sure. I&rsquo;m just getting going with my API surface area map.</p>
<p>My goal is to be able to list 20-30 microservices, and generate a basic visualization showing the approximate scope. Then I can use this in my decision making around whether or not I add features to an existing service, or spin it out as an entirely new service.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m fascinated by the rise of Twitter bots. Little automated bundles of social media joy, built to spew mostly nonsense, but everyone once in a while you find nuggets of wisdom in the Twitter API fueled bots. Personally I have never built a Twitter bot, only because I don&rsquo;t need another distraction, and I can see the addictive potential of bot design.</p>
<p>My partner in crime Audrey Watters (<a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters">@audreywatters</a>), who has hands on experience building her own bots, said something interesting the other day while we were partaking in our daily IPAs&mdash;the wordnik APIs it the base building block of any Twitter bot.</p>
<p>Sure enough, when you search &ldquo;<a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=twitter+bots+wordnik">twitter bots wordnik</a>&rdquo; on the Googlez, you get a wide variety of python, nobde.js, php, and other recipes for building Twitter bots, with almost all of them using the Wordnik API as the core linguistics engine for the bot.</p>
<p>Two overlaps with other stories I written here. 1) <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/04/twitter-api-is-gateway-drug-for-internet-of-things/">I feel the Twitter API holds a lot of potential as a training ground for IoT connectivity</a>, and 2) I think APIs, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/01/i-find-it-interesting-that-wordnik-created-the-api-definition-format-swagger/">specifically the Wordnik API, and the work to come out of Wordnik, like Swagger, has a significant role to play</a> in the future of the Internet.</p>
<p>I know many of us technologists have grand visions of where the Internet is going, and would like things to happen faster. but I think the &ldquo;smart&rdquo; everything we are looking for is going to take some time, and is something you can see playing out slowly in things like Twitter bot design. I&rsquo;m sure there are many negative incarnations, but many of the Twitter bots I&rsquo;ve seen have been interesting little nuggets of API driven (Twitter &amp; Wordnik) chaos, driving us towards an unknown, but definitely Internet connected, online world.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Jan 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/swagger-api-docker.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm rebuilding my underlying architecture using microservices, and docker containers, and I'm <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/28/using-apisjson-for-my-microservice-navigation-and-discovery/">using APIs.json for navigation and discovery within these new API stacks</a> that I use to make my world go around. As I assign each microservice, and <a href="http://apisjson.org/format.html">APIs.json file</a>, taking inventory of the building blocks that make the service operate, I also begin including docker into the equation, and I find myself using Swagger definitions as a sort of fingerprint for my docker powered microservices.</p>
<p>Each microservice lives as its own Github repository, within a specific organization. I give each one its own APIs.json, indexing all the elements APIs of that specific microservice. This can include anything I feel is important, like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>X-Signup -</strong> Where to signup for the service.</li>
<li><strong>X-Twitter -</strong> The twitter account associated with the service.</li>
<li><strong>X-Samples -</strong> Where you can find client side code samples.</li>
</ul>
<p>As long as you put X- before the property, you can put anything you want. There are only a handful of sanctioned APIs.json property types, and one of them you will find in almost all my APIs.json files generated for my platform is:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Swagger -</strong> A reference to a machine readable Swagger definition for each API.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another one I&rsquo;m starting to use, as I&rsquo;m building out my microservice infrastructure, is:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>X-Docker-Image -</strong> A link to a docker image that supports this API.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of my microservices I have a supporting Docker image that is the backend for each API. Sometimes I will have multiple Docker images for variant back-ends for the same API fingerprint. Using APIs.json I can go beyond just finding the API definition, and other supporting building blocks. I can also find the backend needed to actually deliver on the API I have defined by a specific Swagger definition. I&rsquo;m just in the early stages of this work, and this series of posts reflects me trying to work much of this out.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">browse my work on Github</a>, most of it is public. The public elements all live in the gh-pages branch, while the private aspects live within the private master branch.  It is all a living workbench for me, so expect broken things. If you have questions, or would like more access to better understand, let me know. I&rsquo;m happy to consider adding you to the Github organization as collaborator so that you can see more of it in action. I will also chronicle my work here on the blog, as I have time, and have semi-interesting things to share.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Jan 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/kin-lane-api-navigation.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m rebuilding my underlying architecture using microservices and docker containers, and the glue I&rsquo;m using to bind it all together is <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a>. I&rsquo;m not just using APIs.son to deliver on discoverability for all of my services, I am also using it to navigate around my stack. Right now I only have about 10 microservices running, but I have a plan to add almost 50 in total by the time I&rsquo;m done with this latest sprint.</p>
<p>Each microservice lives as its own Github repository, within a <a href="https://github.com/kin-lane">specific organization</a>. I give each one its own APIs.json, indexing all the elements APIs of that specific microservice. APIs.json has two main collections, "apis" and "include". For each microservice APIs.json, I list all the properties for that API, but I use the include element to document the urls of other microservice APIs.json in the collection.</p>
<p>All the Github repositories for this microservice stack lives within a single Github organization, which I give a "master" repo, which acts as a single landing page for the entire stack. It has its own APIs.json file, but rather than having any API collections, it just uses includes, referencing the APIs.json for each microservice in the stack.</p>
<p><a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/kin-lane-api-navigation-2_png.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>APIs.json acts as an index for each microservice, but through the include collection it also provides links to other related microservices within its own stack, which I use to navigate, in a circular way between all supporting services. All of that sounds very dizzying to write out, and I&rsquo;m sure you are like WTF?  You can <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">browse my work on Github</a>, some of it is public, but much of it you have to have oAuth access to see. The public elements all live in the gh-pages branch, while the private aspects live within the private master branch.</p>

        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-carrot.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p>I spend time each day reviewing about 15 different press release distribution websites, looking for API related news for <a href="http://api.report">API.Report</a>, and potentially seeds for stories elsewhere on the API Evangelist network.</p>
<p>One thing I&rsquo;m noticing a lot, are companies who reference their API as bullet point in a release, or sometimes as a footnote in their about section at the end of the release, but when you go to their website you can&rsquo;t find any mention of API.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing for many, they just haven&rsquo;t thought about making the API something that is front and center, relinquishing it to just "feature status". There are also others who do not believe in the whole &ldquo;public&rdquo; API thing, and see their API as more secret sauce, something that should be kept close to your chest.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, I&rsquo;m looking to better understand how I can help companies be more public with their API presence, even if the API itself isn&rsquo;t open to the public. My first instinct is to just email the company, and ask why they aren&rsquo;t more public with API, but I know from experience it isn&rsquo;t the best approach. ;-)</p>
<p>With this in mind, I&rsquo;ll be exploring new ways I can encourage companies to be more public with their API presence, and help them understand the benefits of this approach&mdash;let me know if you have any good ideas.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Jan 2015</span>

<p>I have most of the core platform that I run API Evangelist on <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/">re-engineered as individual microservices</a>, defined on Github, and running using Docker instances. I&rsquo;m using <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/28/using-apisjson-for-my-microservice-navigation-and-discovery">APIs.json for discovery, navigation</a>, and to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/28/using-swagger-as-fingerprint-for-my-microservice-docker-containers">connect swagger API definitions, to their docker backends</a>.  So far I have 18 microservices, which I define as very simple APIs, that do one thing, and focus on doing it well.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very critical about any feature I add in, working hard to keep each service as micro as I can, reducing complexity, and bloat in any single API.  However, with each service I reach the point where I have to cut off feature creep, and establish an entirely new API definition--I am at this point with my link service.</p>
<p>I have a pretty bloated link management system in the legacy version of my platform, something which handles links for functions ranging from <a href="https://pinboard.in/u:kinlane">Pinboard</a> integration, to handling linkrot on my public website. My legacy system runs using an API too, but it is a sloppily designed API, with a wide surface area, something I&rsquo;m looking to prevent in the next version.</p>
<p>So far I&rsquo;ve broken out a single API into three separate microservices:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Link -</strong> A dead simple link management tool, allowing me to add a title, and url to a simple link data store, for future use.</li>
<li><strong>Curated - </strong>A service to manage links I curate from many sources, including additional bells &amp; whistles, like pulling text body, taking screenshot, and much more.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Linkrot -</strong> A link storage system designed for a singe purpose&mdash;to address link rot on my public websites. The API works with a simple JS library to store, monitor, and take screenshots of websites I link to across my network.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have about five other simple, link related, microservices I&rsquo;m planning, but these three designs represent the main link resources I need to make API Evangelist work. All of the microservices I&rsquo;m designing will be open sourced at some point, but the linkrot implementation is one I may also be offering as a service. I&rsquo;m enjoying the feature across my sites, and is something that I think has some viability as a basic service.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure my own definition of what a microservice is--will evolve, ebb and flow, but for now the first rule of microservice club for me, is keep things doing one thing, and doing it very well&mdash;enforcing simplicity in every decision.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-mobile-security.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>I cringe, when I think about the number of mobile applications out there, that people depend on in their personal and professional lives, that are using insecure APIs, allowing&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personally_identifiable_information">personally identifiable information (PII)</a> to flow across the open Internet. I&rsquo;m a big advocate for helping <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/27/if-you-have-a-publicly-available-mobile-app-you-have-a-public-api/">mobile developers understand the important role that a public API can play in this situation</a>, but another side of the discussions that also scares me is the fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) that also emerges as part of this conversation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve covered recent security and privacy involving mobile usage of APIs at <a href="http://101.apievangelist.com/2014/01/08/are-your-api-security-practices-in-better-shape-than-the-snapchat-api/">Snapchat</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/06/another-high-profile-mobile-to-api-security-breach-this-one-at-moonpig-greeting-cards/">Moonpig</a>, and was processing the API news this morning for inclusion on <a href="http://api.report">API.Report</a>, when I came across this press release, <a href="http://api.report/2015/01/27/wandera-finds-official-nfl-app-to-be-leaking-users-personal-data-just-days-ahead-of-the-big-game/">Wandera Finds Official NFL App to be Leaking Users' Personal Data Just Days Ahead of The Big Game</a>. I can get behind the NFL securing their users personal data, but have a hard time jumping on the bandwagon when this is used as PR for a mobile security service, in the lead up to the Superbowl.</p>
<p>Understanding how everyday mobile apps are using APIs to communicate in the cloud is important. Sharing stories about how to map out this very public surface area, and secure it properly, while giving end-users more awarness and control over their PII is critical. Doing this in the name of marketing, PR, or to ride a fear hype wave is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not ok</span>. Yet, I fear this will become commonplace in coming months and years, as security breaches, cybersecurity, and privacy are front and center in the media.</p>

<p>As we get close to wrapping up the first month in 2015, it is clear that Internet security and privacy will continue to be front and center this year. As technology continues to play a central role in our personal and business lives--security, transparency, and respect for privacy is only growing more critical.</p>
<p>I know I'm biased in thinking that APIs will continue to take a central role in this conversation, but I feel it is true. Many of the existing conversations around security about platforms like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/27/if-you-have-a-publicly-available-mobile-app-you-have-a-public-api/">Snapchat</a>, and <a href="http://apivoice.com/2015/01/06/another-high-profile-mobile-to-api-security-breach-this-one-at-moonpig-greeting-cards/">MoonPig</a>, are directly related to APIs, while other security scope at companies like Sony, JP Morgan Chase, and beyond could easily be reduced with a sensible API strategy.</p>
<p>Companies are increasingly operating online, but do not act like any of information lives in an online environment. Adopting an API approach to defining company resources, helps map out this surface area, acknowledging it is available over the Internet, and works to define, secure, and monitor this surface in a healthier way.</p>
<p>Mobile users need access to their data, and by applying an API centric approach, providing account management, data portability, and access and identity controls using oAuth, you can increase transparency, while also strengthening overall security. If your company operations is centered around customer and end-user data transactions, you should be making all data points available via an API, accompanied by a well oiled oAuth layer to help end-users manage their resources, playing a significant role in their own privacy and security.</p>
<p>I'm not delusional in thinking that APIs provide a perfect solution for all our security and privacy woes, it doesn't, but it does set a tone for a more healthy conversation about how companies are doing business on the open Internet, and how we can better secure the online web, mobile, and device-based applications we are increasingly depending on in this new world we have created.</p>

        <span class="post-date">26 Jan 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-gears.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>When you start talking about generating server or client side code for APIs, using machine readable API definition formats like <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> or <a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>, many technologists feel compelled to let you know, that at some point you will hit a wall. There is only so far you can go, when using your API definition as guide for generating server-side or clienit-side code, but in my experience you can definitely save some significant time an energy, by auto-generating code using Swagger definitions.</p>
<p>I just finished re-designing 15 APIs that support the core of API Evangelist, and to support the work I wrote four separate code generation tools:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>PHP Server - </strong>Generating a Slim PHP framework for my API, based upon Swagger definition.</li>
<li><strong>PHP Client -</strong> Assemble a custom PHP client of my design, using Swagger definition as guide.</li>
<li><strong>JavaScript Client -</strong>&nbsp;Assemble a custom JavaScript client of my design, using Swagger definition as guide.</li>
<li><strong>MySQL Database - </strong>Generate a MySQL script based upon the data models available in a Swagger definition.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using Swagger, I can get myself 90-100% of the way for most of the common portions of the APIs I design. When writing a simple CRUD API like notes, or for links, I can auto-generate the PHP server, and a JS client, and underlying MySQL table structure, which in the end, runs perfectly with no changes.</p>
<p>Once I needed more custom functionality, and have more unique API calls to make, I then have to get my hands dirty, and begin manually working in the code. However auto-generation of code sure gets me a long way down the road, saving me time doing the really mundane, heavy lifting in creating the skeleton code structures I need to get up an running with any new API.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also exploring using <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, complete with <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> references, and Docker image references to further bridge this gap. In my opinion, a Swagger definition for any API, can act as a fingerprint for which interfaces a docker image supports. I will write about this more in the future, as I produce better examples, but I'm finding that using APIs.json to bind a Swagger definition, with one or many Docker images, opens up a whole new view of how you can automate API deployment, management, and integration.</p>

<li>12276157 - Unified storage for configuring multiple networking technologies - Microsoft Corporation</li>
</ul>
<p>With the other other 1231 mentioning application programming interface or API in the description of the patent. It will take time to understand the scope of role APIs play when APIs are just a metnion in the description, where patents that directly mention in title, and abstract, carry a little more weight. (at least for now)</p>
<p>Another interesting layer so far, were the companies behind the last 2 years of API related patent activity. Here are the top 25 from the list so far.</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft Corporation with 118 patents</li>

<p>I&rsquo;m still learning, understanding, and making sense of these API related patents I&rsquo;m mining. I will work to read, and separate out the hardware related APIs, but only slightly off to the side, as I still think hardware APIs are extremely relevant with the latest IoT evolution. During the process, I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll come up with other buckets to put APIs into, but ultimately looking to understand the role that APIs are playing in the patent game.</p>
<p>I suspect that downloading the last 20+ years of patents, processing them looking for the phrases &ldquo;application programming interface&rdquo;, or the acronym API, is just the beginning. As I read through the patents, learn about the ideas, people, and companies behind them, I&rsquo;m sure my understanding will expand greatly. I&rsquo;ll check in with more data after each import of files, and discovery of any new insights, and as always, you can find my <a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com/">patent API research repository on Github</a>.</p>

<p>David Berlind&rsquo;s (<a href="https://twitter.com/dberlind">@dberlind</a>), <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/news/amid-api-copyright-controversy-api-patent-claim-surfaces/analysis/2015/01/23">Amid The API Copyright Controversy, An API Patent Claim Surfaces</a> story from this last Friday, planted some ideas in my head around APIs and patents&mdash;something that once takes hold, becomes hopeless for me to resist, and 48 hours later, here are my initial thoughts.</p>
<p>Before I begin, let me state, patents and APIs, much like copryight and APIs, are not concepts I subscribe to, but because they are concepts that are being wielded in the API space, I am forced to enter the conversation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll let you read David&rsquo;s piece on Pokitdok&rsquo;s claim regarding their &ldquo;patent-pending API&rdquo; for yourself, something I find very troubling (about Pokitdok). My post is about my journey, after I read David's story, resulting in yet another&nbsp;<a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com/">research project into the politics of patents involving APIs</a>. After reading David's story this Saturday AM (yeah I need a life), I started &ldquo;googling&rdquo; the concept of API patents, just to educate myself&mdash;my eternal mission at API Evangelist.</p>
<p>I was very surprised to find the number of results that come up when you search <a href="https://www.google.com/?tbm=pts&amp;gws_rd=ssl#tbm=pts&amp;q=application+programming+interface">Google Patents for the term &ldquo;application programming interface&rdquo;</a>&mdash;about 552,000 results (0.32 seconds), to be precise. What does this mean? I start reading, and 48 hours later I&rsquo;m still reading. Sure there a number of older patents for hardware APIs, and even many APIs that were established during the web service heyday of the late 90&rsquo;s and early 2000&rsquo;s, but there is much more than that. I was surprised to see the number of patents with APIs as the main focus from API sector leaders like AWS, Twilio, Apigee, and Google.</p>
<p>I have to start with two of the most ironic API patents i have found so far, during my search:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Google</strong> (<a href="http://www.seobythesea.com/2012/04/google-acquires-unisys-patents/">Through Unisys Patent Portfolio Acquisition</a>) - <strong><a href="https://www.google.com/patents/US7437740?dq=Generation+of+Java+language+application+programming+interface+for+an+object-oriented+data+store&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5qDFVKq2BIaGyQTRyIC4Ag&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA">Generation of Java language application programming interface for an object-oriented data store</a></strong> - An embodiment of the present invention is a technique to interface to a repository. A connection between a client and a repository database is established. The repository database has a repository application programming interface (API). The repository database contains objects related to a project management process. The repository API is communicated with to perform an operation based on parameters passed from the client via the connection. A return value associated with the operation is returned to the client.</li>
<li><strong>CopyRightNow</strong> - <strong><a href="https://www.google.com/patents/US20140214700?dq=Disclosed+herein+is+a+method+and+system+for+providing+copyright+protection+for+creative+works+from+within+a+running+content-creating+software+application&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IqHFVOqDDIOxyQSorIKwAw&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA">CopyRightNow Application Programming Interface</a></strong> - Disclosed herein is a method and system for providing copyright protection for creative works from within a running content-creating software application by assembling and submitting a copyright application on the creative work to the United States Copyright Office through the use of a portable application programming interface, which may be utilized by third-party content-creating applications.

Additionally disclosed is a method and system for accessing and sharing copyright-protected creative works through a web accessible software application.</li>
</ul>
<p>I spent most of the day Saturday looking through API patents, trying to separate the hardware from software, and the API adjacent to the specific API patents. I began my journey at <a href="https://www.google.com/?tbm=pts&amp;gws_rd=ssl">Google Patent Search</a>, and eventually find myself using <a href="https://developers.google.com/patent-search/">Google Patent Search API</a> (now deprecated), until I hit the wall, and I end up at the original data source, processing XML files. I&rsquo;m only now getting to year 2013, after 24 hours or making sense of, writing a processing script, and downloading of patent XML files&mdash;so far I have 428 patents where &ldquo;application programming interface&rdquo; shows up in the title, abstract, description, or anywhere else in the content of a patent application.</p>
<p>You can view the <a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com/patents.html">entire patent listing here</a>, and get the <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/patents/blob/gh-pages/data/patents.json">JSON file driving the listing here</a>--as I process each year, going back to 1990, I will publish the resulting JSON.</p>
<p>My head is swimming. Once again I find myself neck deep in a concept I fundamentally disagree with, in hopes of understanding where the battle line exists within the API space, and educate myself enough so that I can articulate a line on this battlefield, in a war I refuse to participate in, yet I find myself sucked into.</p>
<p>From what I can see, API related patents are not something that that will happen in the future, it is already happening, and has been for quite some time. Sure there are many things that need separating when evaluating the 550K API related patents, but after 48 hours of research, I have to say that APIs are being patented at an increasing rate, and is something we just don't talk about publicly.</p>
<p>As I read through many of the titles, and abstracts, of the patent applications within each XML download I&rsquo;ve been processing, I feel like I&rsquo;m reading the antithesis of API Evangelist. On my blog I work every day to better understand how APIs are being used across each business sector, while looking to educate everyone about what is possible, sharing the best practices I discover along the way&mdash;when I read through the API patent abstracts, I see some very educated, and other not so educated bets on how APIs are being used, and where the future might be going, hoping to lock in these ideas, and extract value at some point in time.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I understand that patents are a necessary evil in the world of big business and in startup-land, but it doesn&rsquo;t change my contempt for them. I&rsquo;m sure many of my API heroes like AWS and Twilio are just submitting patents in a defensive stance, but yet again it doesn&rsquo;t shift reduce my concern. To channel my worr around patents being applied in the world of APIs, I&rsquo;m kicking off <a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com/">deeper research, and monitoring in this dark, un-discussed alley of the API economy</a>.</p>
<p>To help me with my research I dowloaded all of 2014 patent submissions,  pulled out all the API related ones, and published as a patent API. To keep up with the amount of patent absurdity that I have read over this beautiful weekend, I have to state my own intent to submit a patent on providing patent APIs. I will take my <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/patent/swagger.json">patent API design</a>, and ensure if you intend to ever organize your patents, and make accessible via APIs you have to pay the piper&mdash;cause you know, this is how this shit gets done!!</p>

<p>i&rsquo;m spending a lot of time lately, playing around with different approaches to deploying APIs in Docker containers. Part of this is because it is the latest trend in API deployment and management, but also because I&rsquo;m preparing for my talk at <a href="http://syd.apidays.io/">API Days in Sydney Australia</a> next month.</p>
<p>I am always working to keep my keynotes in sync with not just my own work, but in alignment with where the wider conversation is going in the API space. I&rsquo;m building off my talk at <a href="http://www.defragcon.com/">Defrag last November</a>, which was titled, "<a href="http://kinlane.github.io/talks/defrag/containers-will-do-for-apis-what-apis-do-for-companies.html">containers will do for APIs what APIs have done for companies</a>".</p>
<p>The title of my talk at API Days in Sydney is, <em>"The Programmable World With APIs And Containers"</em>. While some of my talk will be inspirational, trying to understand where we are headed with APIs and containers, much of it will also be rooted in my own work to run my own business world using APIs and Docker, and using APIs.json and Swagger to help me orchestrate my resources.</p>
<p>I apologize for the gaps in my normal writing, and the heavy focus on Docker lately, but it is where my mind is at, from an operational standpoint, in preparation for the conversation in Australia, and from what I&rsquo;m seeing, it is in sync with the wider API and cloud computing conversation.</p>

<p>The API space is continuing its rapid expansion, and along with the number of API design, deployment, management, and integration providers, and the number of API conferences, there are some new sources of discussion around APIs--one as a YouTube Channel, and the other as a SoundCloud podcast.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKK2ir0jqCvfB-kzBGka_Lg">API Workshop</a> -</strong> We'll discuss topics around API Design, including: sustainability concepts: how to design APIs that last, new ideas in API design, voices and posts from the API blog world.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://soundcloud.com/apisuncensored">APIsUncensored</a> -</strong> The official home of the APIs Uncensored podcast, a monthly series where Ole Lensmar and Lorinda Brandon blather about all things APIs with experts in the industry.</li>
</ul>

<p>API Workshop is a production by J(a)son Harmon (<a href="https://twitter.com/jharmn">@jharmn</a>), and APIsUncensored is from the smart folks over at <a href="http://smartbear.com/">SmartBear</a>(when describing them I always feel tricked into saying they are smart). I was honored to have mentions in both of them, and you can read <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/21/rest-api-design-bridging-what-we-have-to-the-future-by-organizing-the-json-junk-drawer/">my response to API Workshop here</a>, and to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/23/a-conversation-about-my-subway-map-api-on-the-apisuncensored-podcast/">APIsUncensored over here</a>.</p>
<p>In my opnion, it is a healthy sign for the space to see more video and audio outlets emerge&mdash;the space needs as many open voices, educating the masses as it can possess. Maybe soon we'll need an aggregator of all the sources of great information! (get to work on that please)</p>
<p>I posted a video in response to my reference in the API Workshop episode, in addition to my blog post. Something I&rsquo;m working on for APIsUncensored as well, continuing to expand my presence on these important channels. Personally I&rsquo;m a big podcast listener, over YouTubing, but everyone has a different set of frequencies they tune into, and I think it is important to maximize the reach.</p>
<p>Now if only we could get the next episode of <a href="http://trafficandweather.io/">Traffic &amp; Weather!</a> Wink, Wink!</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Jan 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://subway.map.apievangelist.com/index.html"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/subway-map-api.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>There is a new podcast on SoundCloud called <a href="https://soundcloud.com/apisuncensored">APIsUncensored</a>, from the folks over at SmartBear. I was honored to have a mention in the first episode, where they brought up a project I did a couple of months back, which I called the <a href="http://subway.map.apievangelist.com/index.html">Subway Map API</a>. I <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/01/my-turkey-holiday-project-a-subway-map-api/">published a full story on what I was doing</a>, and launched  supporting Github repo, and API, but the work was very much a weekend side project, and something that will need a lot more love before it goes anywhere.</p>
<p>Ole Lensmar (<a href="https://twitter.com/olensmar">@olensmar</a>) admitted that when he introduced the project, he didn&rsquo;t really get it, but ultimately in their segment, they accomplished what I was looking to do&mdash;stimulate conversation. The Subway Map API isn&rsquo;t about the ideas I plotted on the map for API Evangelist, it is about the format for grouping, and mapping out iof deas&mdash;then evolving them through conversation. Don&rsquo;t get hung up on my groupings of API design, deployment, management, etc., because my mission is to help introduce people to the world of providing and consuming APIs.</p>
<p>The goal of the project is to provide a platform where anyone can step up and frame a conversation about the lifecycle that means the most to them, their company, their products, and industry. When I first published the proejct, I quickly sent it out to two groups:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale</a></strong> - Life-cycle to 3Scale is about helping people manage the APIs they&rsquo;ve deployed, and I will be helping create a v1 map, based upon great work that Manfred has done on this subject.</li>
<li><strong><a title="SmartBear" href="http://bit.ly/1oy8CIN">SmarBear</a></strong> - Life-cycle to SmartBear is about helping people monitor, test, and understand the APIs they posses, and if you guys have any stories on your blog to help me see this vision, I can help translate into a map.</li>
</ul>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get hung up on the maps I created, and don&rsquo;t even get hung up on it being a subway map. As Ole mentioned you can add bus routes, train routes, etc. Via the API you can control the color, shapes, direction, connectors and labels for every aspect of the map. If you want to draw a straight line with 10 dots in a row, go for it. If you want to draw a big circle with 10 stops along the way, going all the back to the beginning, go for it.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://subway.map.apievangelist.com/index.html">Subway Map API</a> project was a fun thing I did for the weekend, and was looking to jump-start the conversation, something I think I did--eventually I&rsquo;d love for someone to build an interface for facilitating this conversation. John Musser nailed it when he articulated the overall objective, and that is to create the most meaningful visual as possible, to help someone understand a Wycliffe related to the world of APIs. Think of John&rsquo;s series of hockey stick API growth charts, or his API business  models diagrams, these have become ubiquitous in API discussions, and if you create the next generation one for API design, deployment, management, integration, or other&mdash;you win!</p>
<p>I'll work on a video response to go with this story. I&rsquo;m neck deep in API-micro-service-docker-land, and don&rsquo;t have the bandwidth to pull head up, I love the conversation!</p>

        <span class="post-date">22 Jan 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.httphub.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/Httphub-Logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I come across a lot of API related companies during my monitoring of the space, which I queue up, and as I have time, I work to explore and understand what they do. One company that I&rsquo;ve had open in a tab for the last week is <a href="https://www.httphub.com/">HTTPHUB</a>.</p>
<p>HTTPHUB is very interesting. It starts by giving you a root namespace, like <span style="text-decoration: underline;">https://kinlane.httphub.com</span>, and from there I can add on any resources on, and make it either public or private&mdash;then I can POST any JSON to this resource in the body. So I could create <span style="text-decoration: underline;">https://kinlane.httphub.com/notes/</span>, and craft a simple form + script to post any data I submit to my HTTPHUB resource.</p>
<p>I think that HTTPHUB captures the simplicity of APIs. Obviously the system will have some limitations, but ultimately it makes on boarding with the concept of APIs, and getting up and running with an API backend as frictionless as possible. HTTPHUB also gives you logging, and user management for your namespace, adding some other essential elements you will need for your API backend.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.httphub.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/Httphub-examples.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Here are some of the features of an HTTPHUB account:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlimited requests (rate limited)</li>
<li>3Gb of storage space</li>
<li>300.000 resources</li>
<li>3.000 namespace users</li>
<li>3Mb Max POST size</li>
<li>Signup and quota management for namespace users</li>
<li>Authenticate with credentials or IP address</li>
<li>Register up to 5 different accounts using the same email address</li>
</ul>
<p>HTTPHUB also provides a pretty slick demo feature, using demo test data, in conjunction with <a href="http://www.getpostman.com/">Postman</a>. They provide you with a link to the Postman Chrome app, and a link to a collection file that you can import. This gives you a listing of all of the base endpoints for HTTPHUB, which you can then use to expand, and manage your HTTPHUB API backend--no programming necessary.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.httphub.com/">HTTPHUB</a> is most interesting to me because its simple, intuitive, and potentially something you could self-define exactly the backend resources you need, as you need them. Imagine if applications could grow its own backend? Allowing end-users to add to their world, changing how they store contacts, or take notes&mdash;using a backend that flexes, grows, and fits end-users needs like a glove.</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Jan 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.getpostman.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/postman/postman-logo.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I've been a <a href="http://www.getpostman.com/">Postman</a> user for a while, as a tool for quickly making API calls against the APIs I use most, and explore the new APIs I discover daily. As I use Postman, I can't help but think the concept of assembling collections of API calls using Postman, is in sync with part of our vision for <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>--we just need a common way to communicate.</p>
<p>APIs.json is not just for defining the API operations that exist within a specific domain, which is the most common approach, it is also about assembling collections of multiple APIs, for a specific purpose. In my mind, the motivations for assembling Postman collections, and APIs.json collections are definitely in alignment.</p>
<p>Similar to providing resources for translating between popular API definition formats like <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> and <a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>, I want to make sure and translate between emerging API discovery and collection formats. While I&rsquo;d love for APIs.json to become the default standard for API discovery, I&rsquo;m happy to embrace other formats, designed for other API tools&mdash;as long as they are striving to be as open as they can.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 5px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-hourglass.png" alt="" width="100" align="right" /></p>
<p>I sign up for a lot of APIs, and when I encounter a frictionless on-boarding process, I feel the need to showcase, and help everyone understand how important it is to make the process as easy as possible. I'm still amazed at how many new APIs make this really, really hard. I will write a separate story after this about <span style="text-decoration: underline;">how not to on-board with an API</span>, but for now lets take a look at a kick-ass example.</p>
<p>This example comes from the&nbsp;<a href="http://niaid.github.io/3dpx_api/">National Institutes of Health (NIH) 3D Print Exchange API</a>. When it comes to signing up for API access, the only thing that can make this easier is providing an API for the process, but for right from the home page you can signup for an API key.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/nih-3d-print-exchange-onboarding-1.png" alt="" width="90%" align="middle" /></p>
<p>Once I provide my first name, last name, email, and optionally some details on how I will use the APIs, I am given my API key. I don&rsquo;t have to click again to find my API key, and I&rsquo;m given an example API call, complete with my API key.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/nih-3d-print-exchange-onboarding-2.png" alt="" width="90%" align="middle" /></p>
<p>My first click gives me the instant gratification I am looking for via a simple API call, resulting in an example JSON response. I do not have to work to find my key or figure out how to make my first API call, it is all given to me immediately.</p>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/nih-3d-print-exchange-onboarding-3.png" alt="" width="90%" align="middle" /></p>
<p>I'm up and running with the&nbsp;NIH 3D Print Exchange API in two clicks. I don't have to fill out a long form, wait for access, or work to find my keys, and fumble with how to make my first API call. To reenforce this, I look in my email inbox, and there is an email providing my API keys again, along with the link to make my first API call.</p>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/nih-3d-print-exchange-onboarding-4.png" alt="" width="90%" align="middle" /></p>
<p>Like I said above, the only thing that would make that easier, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/16/with-number-of-apis-continuing-to-grow-account-automation-will-be-key/">is for all of this to be a series of API calls, which would make the on-boarding process programmatic</a>. Eventually I could see this being essential, but for now I'm happy to see them not only standardizing API on-boarding across federal agencies, but making it as dead simple as you possibly can.</p>
<p>I'm a big fan of frictionless API on-boarding, and I applaud NIH and 18F for their work on the&nbsp;NIH 3D Print Exchange API. I will keep an eye on future releases, for more stories on healthy patterns I'm seeing in API deployment in the federal government.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update: </strong>I'm aware I left my keys in these pics, it was easier to reset them, then to blurr them out, and I think it helps with point. ;-)</em></p>

<p>I referenced the <a href="https://ridb.recreation.gov/">Recreation Information Database (RIDB)</a>, in my story late last year, when I was <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/16/i-need-help-to-make-sure-the-dept-of-agriculture-leads-with-apis-in-their-parks-and-recreation-rfp/">asking for your help to make sure the Department of Agriculture leads with APIs in their parks and recreation RFP</a>.  I'm not exactly sure where it fits in with the RFP, because the RIDB spans multiple agencies.</p>
<p>Here is the description from the RIDB site:</p>
<blockquote><em>RIDB is a part of the Recreation One Stop (Rec1Stop) project, initiated as a result of a government modernization study conducted in 2004. Rec1Stop provides a user-friendly, web-based resource to citizens, offering a single point of access to information about recreational opportunities nationwide. The web site represents an authoritative source of information and services for millions of visitors to federal lands, historic sites, museums, and other attractions/resources.</em></blockquote>
<p>When I wrote the post last October, I referenced the <a href="http://ridb-dev.nsitellc.com/docs/api/v1/RIDB_API_Requirements_20150113.pdf">PDF for the REST API Requirements for the US Forest Service Recreation Information Database (RIDB</a>), but this week I got an update, complete with <a href="http://ridb-dev.nsitellc.com/docs/api/v1/#introduction">fresh links to a preview of a pretty well designed API</a>, complete with <a href="https://github.com/tripit/slate">documentation developed using Slate</a>.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t actually hacked on the endpoints, but I took a stroll through the docs, and my first impression was it is well designed, and robust, including resources for organizations involved with the RDB, recreational areas, facilities, campsites, permit entrances, tours, activities, events, media, and links.  The RIDB documentation also includes details on errors, pagination, version, and a data dictionary, and the on-boarding was frictionless when looking to get a key.</p>
<p>Everything is in dev mode with the RIDB API, and the team is looking for feedback. I&rsquo;m not entirely sure they wanted me to publish as story on API Evangelist, but I figure the more people involved the better, as I&rsquo;m not sure when I&rsquo;ll get around to actually hacking on the API. I&rsquo;m happy to see such a quick iteration towards the next generation of the RIDB API, and it makes me hopeful to be covering so many new API efforts out of the federal government in a single day.</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Jan 2015</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MBXsmSrKE8"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/REST-API-Design-Avoid-future-proofing-with-the-JSON-junk-drawer-YouTube.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>API storyteller J(a)son Harmon (<a href="https://twitter.com/jharmn">@jharmn</a>) has a new YouTube channel up called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKK2ir0jqCvfB-kzBGka_Lg">API Workshop</a>. He's going to be publishing regular API design workshop episodes, with the latest one titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKK2ir0jqCvfB-kzBGka_Lg">REST API Design: Avoid future proofing with the JSON junk drawer</a>. J(a)son provides a nice overview of how you should be structuring the JSON for your API, focusing on the usage of key / value stores. Ironically he uses APIs.json as an example of why you <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SHOULD NOT</strong></span> use custom key / values within your JSON. What is ironic about this, is that he makes the case for APIs.json properties, giving me a great starting point for helping folks better understand <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, and why properties are key to its evolution, and flexibility.</p>
<p>The process J(a)son outlines in the portion of this segment that referred to APIs.json, describes the lifecycle of an APIs.json property, towards becoming more of a "first class property". There are three phases of an APIs.json property:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>X-Property - </strong>A user defined property, allowing anyone to craft exactly the properties that matter to them</li>
<li><strong>Property - </strong>An official machine readable APIs.json property element, acknowledging its wide usage, potential as common blueprint</li>
<li><strong>"First Class Property or Collection"&nbsp;</strong>- Baking a property into the specification as default property of APIs collection, or establishing as sub-collection for the API</li>
</ol>
<p>The lesson J(a)son provides, describes the journey of each APIs.json property, the difference is in that his lesson provides best practices for API providers who are designing new APIs, helping them avoid the creation of a junk drawer, and the APIs.json property format is being applied to define the junk drawer that we have (aka the public API space). This represents the fundamental separation between my approach to defining the space vs. many other technologists&mdash;I am trying to map out what we have, and get us the next step in our evolution, while others are working hard to define where we should be going.</p>
<p>When Steve and I originally hammered out the <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json format</a>, we couldn't 100% agree on what should be first class properties and collections for each API defined using an APIs.json file&mdash;what you see in version 0.14 is what we agreed to, the rest needs to be defined by the community, through actually implementations and discussion on the <a href="https://github.com/api-commons/api-json/issues">APIs.json Github repo</a>.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-recycling.jpg" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p>When you are crafting the JSON, for a new API, J(a)son&rsquo;s lesson is very important, but when you are evaluating hundreds of APIs, and trying to define a common pattern for representing not just the tech, but the business, and politics of an API&mdash;you don&rsquo;t have as much control over how things get defined. I&rsquo;m not worried about the overhead involved with adding a little more complexity to my code, to bridge the well-defined aspects of API operations with the lesser-defined parts of the space.</p>
<p>Ideally, in one of the next iterations of APIs.json, the official properties of Swagger, RAML, Blueprint, and WADL can move up into a first class collection for each API called definitions, and maybe also consider moving API Commons up to be a first class licensing collection as well.  I&rsquo;m also looking to graduate some X-properties to official status, based upon <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">creating APIs.json for over 700+ companies</a>, and having identified almost <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/blob/gh-pages/data/properties.json">150 separate properties that can be used to describe API operations</a>. All of this represents the API sector coming into focus, and I do not think all of these properties should become "first class" properties or collections&mdash;I am just trying to make sense of the "junk drawer" that we have, and help provide a blueprint for a machine readable formats that can help us evolve it towards the future we want.</p>
<p>I have been asked by several folks to better explain Steve and mine APIs.json vision, and J(a)son&rsquo;s story gives me the opportunity to help kick off this storytelling. In an effort to keep this story short, I&rsquo;m going to follow J(a)son&rsquo;s lead and move the rest of this story on to YouTube, so if you want to better understand APIs.json properties, you can watch my video response to J(a)son's story, which augments this post, and hopefully provides some better examples, along with narrative.</p>

        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-no.png" alt="" width="100" align="right" /></p>
<p>I wrote a piece earlier today about the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/21/this-is-how-you-onboard-with-an-api/">kick-ass on-boarding process at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) 3D Print Exchange API</a>--within two clicks I had my API key and was making an API call. To contrast this post I wanted to provide an example of how not to on-board with an API.</p>
<p>I am always amazed at how hard people make it to sign up and play with an API in 2015. Today's example of on-boarding with the most friction you can imagine comes from the <a href="http://developer.garmin.com/wellness-api/request-the-api/">Garmin Wellness API</a>--I think their API signup form speaks for itself.</p>
<p><a href="http://developer.garmin.com/wellness-api/request-the-api/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/garmin-onboarding-form.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>I understand you are worried about what people might do with your API, but that is kind of the whole point of doing an API. If you are looking to encourage innovation on your API, this is not how you want to on-board your developers, and make a first impression.</p>
<p>There are other ways to manage API integrations without restricting users from day one. Make sure and help make API on-boarding as frictionless as possible, there is no reason to use a form like Garmin has.</p>

<p>There is an very interesting new 3D Print Exchange API from the <a href="http://www.nih.gov/">National Institutes of Health (NIH)</a>. The NIH 3D Print Exchange is designed for publishing "biomedically-relevant" 3D models, that anyone can download and use as blueprint for printing on a their 3D printer.</p>
<p>I've been <a href="http://3d-printing.apievangelist.com/companies.html">tracking on 3D printing APIs since 2011</a>, when I started profiling <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/12/19/api-driven-3d-printing-and-manufacturing-supply-chain/">how APIs were being used by printing, and 3D printing providers</a>. It is interesting to see an industry focused 3D printing API emerge, which I feel is a sign the space is maturing, and will continuing to evolve in 2015.</p>
<p>Another thing to note in this story, is simplistic approach the NIH took in deploying their API. The 3D Print Exchange API has all the essential building blocks to help you understand what the API does, on-board with the API (another story), and get the support you need throughout integration via <a href="https://twitter.com/nih3dprint">Twitter</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/niaid/3dpx_api">Github</a>, and <a href="mailto: 3dprint@nih.gov">email</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://niaid.github.io/3dpx_api/">3D Print Exchange API</a> has all the fingerprints of <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">18F</a> on it, demonstrating that APIs in the federal government will continue to pick up momentum with the assistance of 18F of the Presidential Innovation Fellowship (PIF) program out of the White House and GSA.</p>

<p>An open project for me this month, is about better understanding how API keys are provisioned, and how developers are given access to valuable resources. As the number of APIs grows, so do the number of APIs that we depend on in any single application, forcing developer to have to manage many API keys, potentially from many different platforms.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t take an API expert to see that many <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/16/with-number-of-apis-continuing-to-grow-account-automation-will-be-key/">current practices by API providers requiring consumers to manually register for an account, will not scale</a>. We need more automated ways for not just discovering, but also on-boarding with APIs, allowing API consumers to begin using an API, without the current overhead required.</p>
<p>One idea I&rsquo;m bouncing around in my own APIs, is allowing for instant account creation via an API, allowing you to programmatically generate new account, a new app, and API keys. Of course I do not want these new accounts to have full access to everything, and using my 3Scale API management I will create a specific service tier for these accounts, limiting what they can do.</p>
<p>I want to take this another step further though, I do not want just any spammy, Johnny come-along to be able to create new accounts, without any sort of validation. To help filter, I&rsquo;m developing a Github account ranking layer, requiring you to pass along your Github user with the generation of new account, app, and keys. I will pull the profile for the Github user, and some statistics on their overall profile, and make some assumptions on the developers trustworthiness.</p>
<p>Immediately this approach will limit API access for a number of people, which in some scenarios may not be ideal, but for my APIs, I&rsquo;m willing to allow instant account creation, and API access to people who have an active, verifiable Github presence. I&rsquo;ve been a proponent of API providers providing Github login for developer accounts for some time now, and this seems like a logical next step.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see where I go with this. It is more an exercise than it is a real thing, but who knows, in addition to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/14/storing-api-keys-in-the-private-master-github-repository-for-use-in-github-pages/">using Github to manage my API keys securely</a>, maybe I can actually use it to instantly access new APIs, without having the current overhead I face with each new API on-boarding experience.</p>

Most of the content is API driven already, so it makes sense to put some of the management tools side by side with the content or data that I&rsquo;m publishing.</p>
<p>These management tools are simple JavaScript, that use the Github API to manage HTML, and JSON files that I have stored either publicly or privately within repositories. I use Github oAuth to work with the Github API, but to work with other APIs I need a multitude of other API keys, including <a href="http://3scale.net">3Scale generated API keys</a> I use to access my own API infrastructure.</p>
<p>My solution is to store a simple api-keys.json file in the root of my private master repository, and then again using Github oAuth, and the Github API, I access this file, read the content of the JSON file into a temporary array I can use wthin my management tools. If you do not have access to the Github repository, you won&rsquo;t be able to read the contents of api-keys.json, rendering the management tools useless.</p>
<p>I will develop a centralized solution to helping manage API keys across all my projects, allowing me to re-use keys for different projects, and easily update, or remove outdated API keys. This approach to storing API keys in my private Github repository is allowing me to easily access keys in client-side apps I run on Github Pages, as well as via server-side applications and APIs&mdash;something that I&rsquo;m hoping will give me more flexibility in how I put multiple APIs across my infrastructure.</p>

<p>When I discuss what is possible when it comes to generating both server and client side code using machine readable API definitions like <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a>, I almost always get push-back, making sure I understand there are limitations of what can be auto-generated.</p>
<p>Machine readable API definitions like Swagger provide a great set of rules for describing the surface area of an API, but is often missing many other elements necessary to define what server side code should actually be doing. The closest I&rsquo;ve gotten to fully generating server side APIs, is when it came to very CRUD-based APIs, that possess a very simple data models--beyond that it is difficult to make "ends meet".</p>
<p>Personally, I do not think my Swagger specs should contain everything needed to define server implementations, this would make for a very bloated, and unusable Swagger specification. For me, Swagger is my central truth, that I use in generating <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/06/server-skeletons-in-restlet-studio-and-apispark/">server side skeletons</a>, client side samples and libraries, and to define testing, monitoring, and interactive documentation for developers.</p>
<p>Working to push this approach forward, I&rsquo;m also now using Swagger as a central truth for my Docker containers, allowing me to use virtualization as a bridge between what my Swagger definitions cannot define for each micro-service or API deployed within a specific container.  This approach is leaving Swagger as purely a definition of the micro-service surface area, and leaving my Docker image to deliver on the back-end vision of this surface area.</p>
<p>These Docker images are using Swagger as a definition for its container surface area, but also as a fingerprint for the value it delivers. As an example, I have a notes API definition in Swagger, for which I have two separate Docker images that support this interface. Each Docker image knows it only serves this particular Swagger specification, using it as a kind of fingerprint or truth for its own existence, but ultimately each Docker image will be delivering its own back-end experience derived from this notes API spec.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just getting going with this new approach to using Swagger as a central truth for each Docker container, but as I&rsquo;m rolling out each of my API templates with this approach, I will blog more about it here. Eventually I am hoping to standardize my thoughts on using machine readable API definition formats like Swagger to guide the API functionality I'm delivering in virtualized containers.</p>

<p>I continuing to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/10/using-containers-to-bridge-what-swagger-cannot-define-on-the-serverside-for-my-apis/">evolve my use of Swagger as a kind of central truth in my API design, deployment, and management lifecycle</a>. This time I&rsquo;m using it as a fingerprint for defining how APIs or micro-services that run in Docker containers function. Along the way I&rsquo;m also using <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> as a framework for organizing these Swagger driven containers, into coherent API stacks or collections, that work together to accomplish a specific objective.</p>
<p>For the project I&rsquo;m currently working on, I&rsquo;m deploying multiple Swagger defined APIs, each as separate Docker containers, providing some essential components I need to operate API Evangelist, like blog, links, images, and notes. Each of these components have its own Swagger definition, and corresponding Docker image, and specific instance of that Docker image deployed within a container.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m using APIs.json to daisy chain all of these APIs or micro-services together. I have about 15 APIs deployed, each are standalone services, with their own APIs.json, and supporting Swagger definition, but the overall project has a centralized APIs.json, which using the includes properties, provides linkage to each individual micro-services APIs.json--loosely coupling all of these container driven micro-services under single umbrella.</p>
<p>At this point, I&rsquo;m just using APIs.json as a harness to define, and bring together the technical aspects of my new API stack. As I pull together other business elements like on-boarding, documentation, and code samples, I will add these as properties to my parent APIs.json. My goal is to demonstrate the value&nbsp;<a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> brings to the table when it comes to API and micro-service discovery, specifically when you deploy distributed API stacks or collections using Docker container deployed micro-services.</p>

        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-anonymous-person.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I find it more valuable to scrub the names of the APIs from about 75% of my stories, which I feel helps them be received by a widest possible audience as possible. If I say &ldquo;API Provider X&rdquo;, other providers just think I&rsquo;m talking about that company, but when I make it generic, I find API providers think I&rsquo;m talking about them.</p>
<p>There are many reasons I would scrub individual or company names from a story, most often this is because they&rsquo;ve asked me not to reference them public, but are fine with me telling the story in an anonymous fashion. However, it occurred to me over time that there are other more powerful storytelling influences potentially behind leaving out specific characters.</p>
<p>Early on I identified that there are a lot of API lessons to be learned across business sectors, but if you reference the specific company, or business sector, many business leaders or developers will put there blinders on, feeling this doesn&rsquo;t apply to them. Ideally companies would identify the potential of hearing stories from other ways of doing business, but unfortunately many lack the imagination to make the transition&mdash;lucky I have enough imagination to go around! ;-)</p>
<p>I thoroughly enjoy storytelling in the API space. Over the last four years I&rsquo;ve developed a voice I enjoy speaking in, and have slowly built an entire toolbox of approaches like scrubbing people or company names, to make my storytelling more impactful, and potentially reach a wider audience. I feel strongly that I would never have been able to do this if API Evangelist was purely a marketing blog for a company, but because I&rsquo;m lucky enough to be able to focus exclusively on entire API space, spanning multiple business sectors, and left to my own devices when it comes to the editorial choices--I&rsquo;ve been able to grow my storytelling in ways I never imagined in 2010 when I first started.</p>

<p>I talked about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/29/adding-rate-limits-for-apis-in-the-documentation-for-each-endpoint/">Twitter's inclusion of rate limits inline with documentation the other day, which is something I added as a new building block</a>, that API providers can consider when crafting their own strategy. Another building block I found while spending time in the Twitter ecosystem, was an oAuth signature generator inline within the documentation.</p>
<p>While browsing the <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public">Twitter documentation</a>, right before you get to the example request, you get a little dropdown that lets you select from one of your own applications, and generate an oAuth signature without leaving the page.</p>

<p>I am seeing oAuth signature generators emerge in a number of API platforms, but this is the first inline version I&rsquo;m seeing. I&rsquo;ve added this to my tentative list of oAuth and security building blocks I recommend, but will give some time before I add. I like to see more than one provider do something before I put it in there, but sometimes when it is just Twitter, that can be enough.</p>

<p>As I read and listen to all of the Internet of Things stories coming out of CES, I&rsquo;m happy to be <a href="http://www.npr.org/2015/01/08/375923229/privacy-security-focal-points-at-ces">hearing discussions around privacy and security</a>, come out of the event. I feel better about IoT security and privacy when I hear things like this, but ultimately I am left with overwhelming concern about of the quantity of IoT devices.</p>
<p>There are many layers to securing IoT devices, and protecting the privacy of IoT users, but I can't help but the think that Internet of Things security and privacy will always begin by asking ourselves if we should be doing this at all. Do we need this object connected to the Internet? Are we truly benefiting from having this item enabled with cloud connectivity?</p>
<p>I'm going to try and keep up with tracking on the API layer being rolled out in support of IoT devices, but not sure I will be able to keep up with the number of devices, and the massive amount of hype around products and services. At some point I may have to tap out, and focus on specific aspects of IoT connectivity ,around what I consider the politics of APIs.</p>

<p>I'm about 1/3 of the way into <a href="http://theapistack.com/">generating Swagger specifications for the APIs at the 700+ companies that I monitor.</a> I have the Swagger specs for almost 250 APIs so far, and have no idea how many I&rsquo;ll have when I'm done (ha, will I ever be done), as the target is kind of ever moving. The only way to get to know an API better than having to create a Swagger spec for it, is to actually integrate with it.</p>
<p>Thankfully I&rsquo;m not integrating with ALL of the APIs I monitor, but I do want to get more intimate with their API surface area, right up to actually having to integrate. There are four ways that I obtain a machine readable API definition for an API:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Manually</strong> - Good ol fashioned elbow grease because there is nothing standard about an APIs documentation, or even the API itself, forcing me to hand craft a Swagger definition that works.</li>
<li><strong>Scraping</strong> - Some APIs documentation is pretty standardized, making it very easy to write a scrape script that harvests, and generates a Swagger skeleton of endpoints, headers, parameters, and other aspects of the interface.</li>
<li><strong><a title="APITools" href="https://www.apitools.com/">APITools</a></strong> - Some APIs that I&rsquo;m actually integrating with, going beyond just a review of their API, I use APITools as a proxy, and make all my API calls via this proxy, and after I hit all the endpoints, I can grab the auto-generated Swagger definition from the APITools interface.</li>
<li><strong>Swagger</strong> - There is already a Swagger definition available for an API, created by the platform owner&mdash;this is when I&rsquo;m in heaven. I love it when APIs create their own API definition, and even better when they create their own <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> file. ;-)</li>
</ul>
<p>I would like to also add to the list, that I use API Blueprint, RAML, I/O Docs, and Apigee Explorer formats as well, but I do not. While these formats are out there, it is an understatement to say they are tucked away, and hidden. I&rsquo;d venture to say the providers are actively assisting API providers in keeping buried, and hard to access&mdash;in my opinion each format should be front and center, accessible with a single click.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons I use <a href="http://swagger.io/">Swagger</a>. If you look at Swagger UI docs, for each endpoint there is a RAW link which takes you directly to the machine readable API definition that drives it. Show me the equivalent on API Blueprint, RAML, Mashery, and Apigee API explorers, and interactive documentation and I&rsquo;ll eat my words. I'm creating my own API stack for converting between all of these formats, but alas this doesn't help me in my API discovery process, because these formats aren't easy to find.</p>
<p>This disconnect, is one of the reasons there is so much fragmentation in API designs, and ultimately a lack of open tooling and services that support the entire API life-cycle&mdash;nobody wants to share their design patterns. Please help me document all the APIs in <a href="http://theapistack.com">my API Stack</a>, and if you know of an existing Swagger spec I don&rsquo;t have, send my way, or <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">publish to the Github repo</a>. Also, if you are actively using an API, can you switch to using an <a href="https://www.apitools.com/">APITools proxy and generate a Swagger spec</a> that way, and also send my way, or <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">publish to the Github repo</a>.</p>
<p>I wish I could convince all y'all of the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/21/making-sure-the-most-important-layers-of-api-space-stay-open/">importance of this layer of the API space being not just machine readable, but also accessible</a>. This is one reason why I&rsquo;m hand rolling all of these API definitions myself, is because I&rsquo;m just going to show you.</p>

<p>His blog post is a worthy read, but what really caught my attention was in the last paragraph&mdash;the simple statement that he is:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&ldquo;using Fuse as a means to explore how a larger, more owner-controlled Internet of Things experience could be support</em>ed&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m intrigued by this concept, and feel it reflects my mission with API Evangelist, where I&rsquo;m looking to create not just a more educated and informed API providers and consumers, but also a more knowledgable, and empowered end-user.</p>
<p>The concept of a owner-controlled Internet of Things experience is something I will be keeping an eye on as I continue to be inundated with Internet of Things API stories. My goal is to better understand how IoT devices are being designed, and deployed, then provide some assistance in how we can ensure platforms lean towards a more &ldquo;owner-controlled experience&rdquo;.</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Jan 2015</span>
        <p><a href="/admin/blog/bit.ly/13esk6Q"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/3Scale/3scale-logo.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>As I am designing my APIs, one of the first things I decide is whether or not I will be making this public. If its a simple enough resource, and doesn't put too much load on my servers, I will usually make it publicly available. However if an API has write capabilities, could potentially put a heavy load on my servers, or just posses some private resource that I want to keep private, I will secure the API.</p>
<p>I use <a href="/admin/blog/bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale for my API management infrastructure</a>--I have since 2011, long before I ever started working with them on projects, and organizing <a href="https://twitter.com/apistrat">@APIStrat</a>. When it comes time to secure any of my APIs, I have a default snippet of code that I wrap each API, validating the application keys, and recording their activity--which 3Scale calls the plugin integration approach.</p>
<p>This time around, I logged into my 3Scale admin area, went to my API integration area, and saw the setup for the 3Scale Cloud API proxy that they are calling <a href="http://www.3scale.net/apicast/">APICast</a>. I can't help but notice the simple setup of the proxy--I give it a private base URL for my API, it gives me a public base URL back, and then I can configure the proxy rules, setting the rate limits for each of my API resources.</p>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/3scale-apicast.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is it. I can set up my APIs in a sandbox environment, then take it live when I am ready. It is the quickest way to secure my APIs I've seen, allowing me to instantly lock down my APIs, and require anyone who uses it to register for a key, and then I am able to track on how it is being put to use&mdash;no server configuration or setup needed.</p>
<p>This easy setup, bundled with the fact you can setup 3Scale for free, and get up to 50K a day in API calls, makes it the perfect environment for figuring out your API surface area. Then when ready, you can pay for heavier volume, and take advantage of the other advanced features available via 3Scale. I'm still using the plugin feature for 90% of my endpoints, but some I will be using APICast to quickly stand-up, secure, and monitor some of my APIs. I will publish a how-to after I finish setting this one up.</p>

<p>When you use a well designed, and I hate saying it, but a RESTful API, you know it. I&rsquo;m not a <a href="http://mikeschinkel.com/blog/whatisarestafarian/">restafarian</a>, who is super strict about API design, but I do know an easy-to-use, intuitive interface when I hack on one. Having API resources defined as intuitive URIs, with a handful of sensible header or query parameters, that allows me to excercise my HTTP Verbs, just makes me happy.</p>
<p>I do not expect all API providers to be API design experts, but one design pattern that always frustrates me is when you  pack all of your API resources into a single parameter. <a href="https://www.flickr.com/services/api/">Flickr calls it &ldquo;method&rdquo;</a>, and <a href="http://docs.brightcove.com/en/video-cloud/media/references/reference.html#Video_Read">Brightcove calls it &ldquo;command&rdquo;</a>, and while both of these media API providers then offer a rich number of &ldquo;methods&rdquo; or &ldquo;commands&rdquo;, I just can&rsquo;t help feel this single design decision always detours API integrationa &nbsp;down bumpier, darker side street or alley.</p>
<p>Ultimately I can still get what I need done with APIs who choose to craft their resources in this way, but it takes more work, and requires me to create a special bucket of APIs, that don&rsquo;t quite fit in with the rest of the APIs I&rsquo;m profiling, and integrating with. I&rsquo;m often tempted, with the high profile APIs like Flickr and Brightcove, to craft a new API, and stand it up as a facade that you can use as a proxy, instead of directly connecting to Flickr and Brightcove APIs, but alas not enough time in the day.</p>
<p>You will almost never catch me giving API design advice on API Evangelist, but in this scenario, I have urge you not to follow the design patterns of Flickr and Brightcove when planning your APIs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Jan 2015</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-stacks.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>The properties of each API that is listed in an<a href="http://apisjson.org/"> APIs.json file</a> can be called anything, as long as you preface it with X-, and the URL can point to anything you wish--to me<a href="http://apisjson.org/2014/07/09/the-power-in-api-discovery-for-apisjson-will-be-in-the-api-url-type/"> this is one of the most flexibile aspects of APIs.json</a>. The majority of APIs.json API properties are going to be to URLs designed for human consumption, but the ultimate goal of the project is to establish a core set of machine readable URIs that will help move the API discovery conversation forward.</p>
<p>The first three machine readable properties for APIs listed in an APIs.json are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a title="API Blueprint" href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a></strong> - The machine readable API definition format in markdown.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://swagger.io/">Swagger</a></strong>&nbsp;- The machine readable API definition format in JSON and YAML.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://raml.org/">RAML</a></strong>&nbsp;- The machine readable API definition format in YAML.</li>
</ul>
<p>APIs.json is not looking to provide the solution for the same thing that sensibly designed hypermedia APIs would bring to the table, and only interested in bridging the indexing of the API resources that are currently available. In this context, think of APIs.json as a switchboard, allowing us to navigate each of the popular API definition formats available to use in 2015.</p>
<p>The fourth machine readable property for APIs listed in an APIs.json is:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a> - </strong>A machine readable format for associating licensing fo ran API interface (aka CC, Apache).</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://apisjson.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/apis-json/apisdotjson.png" alt="" width="400" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>With&nbsp;<a href="http://apisjson.org/format/apisjson_0.14.txt">APIs.json version .014</a>, we now have a glimpse of the surface area of APIs present within each APIs.json file, via the API Blueprint, Swagger, and RAML properties, and a basic awarness of the licensing of this surface area using the API Commons property.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not 100% sure what is next for APIs.json property types, but if I had my vote (which I probably do ;-), I&rsquo;d be interested in seeing machine readable references to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Monetization</span> Value - </strong>Units of measurement, allowing me to understand the value delivered by an API. I do not think monetization is an apt title for this area, as money is such a limiting constraint, and value is a more expansive headspace to approach this aspect of API integration.</li>
<li><strong>API <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Terms of Service</span> Questions - </strong>I feel that questions about the terms of service from API providers gets a lot of airplay, but this conversation is much like the TOS themselves, and are heavily weighted in discussion through a provider lens, drowning in legaleze. I&rsquo;m confident that this area needs distillation from its current legaleze format, and be framed as simple questions that span TOS, Privacy Policies, SLA, Copyright, Deprecation, Branding, and other legal layers to API operations.</li>
<li><strong>API <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Clients</span> Connectivity - </strong>Give me a machine readable list of connecitivty options that are available for an API. I want to know what languages area available, as well as links to licensing, code repositories, and Zapier integrations. This is a layer of the conversation that would be better served through a hypermedia conversation, but since we have the world we have, this is a layer of the APIs.json conversation.</li>
</ul>
<p>For me, APIs.json takes the <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">API discovery</a> conversation beyond just the meta, which, don&rsquo;t get me wrong is super valuable, with titles, description, tags, and other characteristics of APIs are critical to discovery, but I want to also be able to go deeper than just a simple keyword search. I want to be able to dig in on the areas above, but in a machine readable, bottom up, organic way.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-discovery.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></p>
<p>I want to be able to ask for:</p>
<ul>
<li>All image APIs, that have a per MB storage, and bandwidth API Value model vs. free or advertising based approaches. I also want to make sure they allow me to set the licensing for my photos, delete my account when done, and have a PHP client, or even better a WordPress plugin.</li>
<li>All video APIs, that have a revenue share model for their own advertising network, as a API Value model. Same as my images I want to make sure they let me set the licensing for videos, and retain ownership over my model. In this case I don&rsquo;t care about specific language clients for integrations, I want to see connectivity for Vimeo, Facebook, Twitter, and other distribution channels.</li>
</ul>
<p>A number of conversation I have had around APIs.json with technologists almost always begins with a very technical API discovery discussion, something that quickly expands to the wider vision opened up by APIs.json around value generated by APIs, limitations imposed by the legal layer of platform operations, and into how we actually connect with valuable API resources. There are many more influences that prevent me from connecting to APIs, than just the technical aspects of integration&mdash;pricing, TOS, privacy, rate limits, and other business and political limitations often trump the tech when I select API platforms.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still working through exactly how to best articulate Steve and mine&rsquo;s vision for APIs.json. I appreciate you listening to my thoughts, as I work through the details, and I would love to hear more of your thoughts around what APIs.json means to you.</p>

<p>I was <a href="https://developers.google.com/helpouts/">cruising around the Google Developer area</a> and I stumbled across <a href="https://helpouts.google.com/partner/landing/provider/googledevelopers">Google Helpouts.</a> A service being billed as <em>&ldquo;Experts with Answers, Meet Developers with Questions&rdquo;</em>. Seems like a more one-to-one version of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>, where you can get the answers you are looking for when it comes to development on the Google platform, but in a more direct, one-to-one way.</p>
<p>Inversely, you can contribute your developer skills, and be one of the knowledgeable developers who are giving back to the developer community. The Google Helpouts page describes it as: <em>Give Back - Continue Learning - Build Your Reputation</em>. I signed up for an account, gave my profile, but the tags that I was able to connect with my profile really didn&rsquo;t match my skills. It seems very programming language, and platform focused at this point--not really for APIs.</p>
<p><a href="https://helpouts.google.com/partner/landing/provider/googledevelopers"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/google-helpouts2.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>At first glance I thought Google Helpouts was more about Google APIs, available as an exentsion of the Google Developer program, but it seems to be a more tech focused, skills matching service. I think the same concept would work well, if applied to APIs, but I don&rsquo;t see any reason for a new platform, just build it on top of <a href="https://api.stackexchange.com/docs">Stack Overflow API</a>&mdash;why re-invent the wheel?</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Jan 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://dp.la/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/digital-public-library-of-america/DPLA_logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>If I had to pick one API that I worship the ground they walk on, and yet for some insane reason I don&rsquo;t write about very often&mdash;it would be the <a href="http://dp.la/">Digital Public Library of America</a>. I can go on for days about how important the work that DPLA does. If you aren&rsquo;t up to speed on DPLA, "The Digital Public Library of America brings together the riches of America&rsquo;s libraries, archives, and museums, and makes them freely available to the world&rdquo;&mdash;via APIs! ;-)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a history lover, so DPLA is extremely interesting, but what they do is so much more important to society at-large, an area that very few APIs can achieve. I am making an extra effort to publish more DPLA stories on API Evangelist, not just because they need it, but also because their approach to APIs is extremely forward thinking and relevant.</p>
<p>First DPLA story out of my writers notebook is about their use of <a href="http://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a>. First off, what is JSON-LD?</p>
<blockquote><em><a href="http://json-ld.org/"> JSON-LD is a lightweight Linked Data format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is based on the already successful JSON format and provides a way to help JSON data interoperate at Web-scale.</a></em></blockquote>
<p>So why does DPLA uses JSON-LD? I like their explanation on the <a href="http://dp.la/info/developers/codex/policies/technologies/">DPLA technologies page</a>:</p>
<blockquote><em><a href="http://dp.la/info/developers/codex/policies/technologies/"> Everyone likes JSON, but it&rsquo;s not great for every purpose.  Pointing from one JSON object to another is a good example (because we do that a lot).  So we use JSON-LD. No worries &ndash; it&rsquo;s still JSON.  It&rsquo;s just got a couple of standardized fields. </a></em></blockquote>
<p>When you are weaving together artifacts from &ldquo;america&rsquo;s libraries, archives, and museums&rdquo;, then providing access as linked data and via APIs, you need to get pretty organized about how you keep track of, and connect your objects. I think it is a testament to the DPLA vision, that they are using JSON-LD, a very structured, and forward leaning vision of how we connect, not just digital objects, but also digital representations of the very physical objects in our world.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to make sure I spend time each month, to at least looking through the <a href="http://dp.la/info/developers/codex/">DPLA API ecosystem</a>, keeping an eye on what they are up to with their API platform, but I intend to also look through the collections and brainstorm on what is possible via the API&mdash;I encourage you to as well.</p>

        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-danger.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I have read several stories about security breaches in the past couple days, ranging from <a href="http://searchsoa.techtarget.com/tip/API-security-more-critical-as-componentization-grows">exploitation of APIs across the distributed systems we are increasingly depending on</a>, to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/06/another-high-profile-mobile-to-api-security-breach-this-one-at-moonpig-greeting-cards/">no security at MoonPig for their mobile app</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/01/05/reverse-engineering-of-the-kayak-api-from-the-mobile-app/">the reverse engineering of a popular mobile app&mdash;this time it is the Kayak mobile app</a>.</p>
<p>Maybe I am biased, but I can&rsquo;t help but think, in a world increasingly driven by mobile devices, we need to treat all applications like they are external, get to work seting up a proper API program, and secure all apps the same way, no matter whether they are used for internal, partner, or public usage. Treating internal apps differently, opens things up for a whole world of hurt when internal systems are compromised, and ignoring how public facing your API is, when embedded in a popular mobile  app, goes into the same category.</p>
<p>If you have a single API stack, that ALL of your systems integrations, web, mobile, and device based-apps use, you have established a single surface area youneed to secure. Then, if you are using modern API infrastructure, a surface area that you can monitor, and have established relevant service composition, tailored for internal, partner, and public access of resources, you will be able to stay in tune with your API usage, and identify negatives situations much faster--across all devices.</p>
<p>If you are operating your business on the Internet today (i hope you are), consider treating all your apps as external, no matter where they reside, or who uses them&mdash;your overall architecture will be much healthier, and resilient because off because of it.</p>

<p>I was working in&nbsp;<a href="http://restlet.com/technical-resources/apispark/guide">APISpark</a>, playing around with different approaches to creating APIs for data stores i have in Amazon S3, Github, and in Google Spreadsheets. The cloud API deployment solution allows me to generate APIs from CSV, XML, JSON and spreadsheet stores in these locations, to a central API platform faster than I could even consider doing manually.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;m managing a simple data API I have, I see the option to generate a &ldquo;server skeleton&rdquo; in the toolbar, something that is also available to me when working in the <a href="http://restlet.com/products/restlet-studio/">Restlet Studio</a>. This is one of the benefits of creating machine readable API definitions like <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> or <a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API blueprint</a> of your APIs. Restlet doesn&rsquo;t generate server code for you from your file stores, it generates a machine readable definition of your file source, then lets you generate a &ldquo;server skeleton&rdquo; from that.</p>
<p>Server skeletons are not a fully functioning API for your file store, APISpark gives you that. These server skeletons are just scaffolding in Java or Node.js, that give you a starting framework for deploying an API beyond the Restlet / APISpark platform. You still have to wire things up to the file store, database, or other location of the data store&mdash;it is just the beginning.</p>
<p>I guess my goals with this post is to educate people that it is possible to generate server skeletons from APISpark, using common data sources, but I also just like the name. I have used the term server-side scaffolding, but I like server skeletons better. I think I will keep using it to describe what you can generate server side when you employ API definition formats like <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> or <a href="/admin/blog/API blueprint">API Blueprint</a>.</p>

<p>I was taking another look at the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/dev/api">Reddit API</a>&nbsp;over the weekend, and thought their listing of API endpoints was pretty interesting. They provide two ways of looking at the platform APIs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API Section</strong> - Listing of Reddit APIs by account, apps, links, listings, and other groupings.</li>
<li><strong>oAuth Scope -</strong> Listing of Reddit APIs by the endpoints oAuth scope.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not sure if it is something all APIs should follow, I just thought it was an interesting approach, something I haven&rsquo;t seen in any other API area. Reddit has a number of APIs, I can see if you have specific goals with the API, this might be useful to have API sorted in this way.</p>
