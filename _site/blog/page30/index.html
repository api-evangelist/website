        <span class="post-date">13 Feb 2016</span>
        <p><a href="http://alpha.apievangelist.com/2015/12/15/playing-with-a-json-representation-for-the-plans-for-many-of-the-leading-apis/">A couple of weeks ago I started playing with a machine readable way to describe the pricing, and plans available for an API</a>. I spent a couple of days looking through over 50 APIs, and how they handled the pricing, and their API access plans, and gathered the details in a master list, which I am using for my master definition. I picked up this work, and moved it forward over the last two days, further solidifying the schema, as well as launching an API, and set of admin tools for me to use.</p>
<p>While my primary objective is to help me establish a machine readable definition that I can use to describe the plans of the APIs I provide, as well as the ones that I monitor as part of my regular work in the space--I needed an easier way to help me track the details of each API's plan. So I got to work creating an simple, yet robust admin tool that allows me to add one or many plans, for each API that I track on.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/api-plans-spec-interface-algolia.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>To help me drive this administrative interface I needed an API (of course), that would allow me to add, edit, and delete the details for each plan, using my API plan schema as a guide. I got to work designing, developing, and launched <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/api/">the first beta version of my API plans API</a>, to help me gather, and organize the details for any API I want, whether its mine, or one of the many public APIs I track on.</p>
<p><a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/api/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/api-plans-ui-interface.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>Now that I have an API, and an administrative interface, I'm going to get to work adding the data I gathered from my previous research. I have almost 60 APIs to enter, then I hope to be able to step back, and see the API plan data Ive gathered in a new light. Once I get to this stage, I'm looking to craft a simple embeddable page for viewing an API's plan, and create some visualizations for looking across, and comparing multiple APIs. I'm looking to apply this concept to verticals, like with business data via APIs like Crunchbase, AngelList, OpenCorporates, and others.</p>
<p>While my API plan schema is far from a stable version, it at least provides me with a beginning definition that I can use in my API profiling process. Here is the current version I have for the Algolia API, to demonstrate a little bit of what I am talking about.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/82f55e8c7adccf2157e7.js"></script>
<p>This current version allows me to track the pages, timeframes, metrics, geo, limits, individual resources, extensions, and other elements that go into defining API plans, and then actually organizing them into plans, that pretty closely match to what I'm seeing from API providers. For each plan I define, I can add specific entries, that describe pricing structures, and other hard elements of API pricing, but then I can also track on other elements, giving me a looser way to track on aspects that impact API plans, but may not be pricing related.</p>
<p>I am pretty happy with what I have so far. Something I hope in a couple of years this could be used as a run-time engine for API operations, in a similar way that the OpenAPI Spec, and API Blueprint are being used used today, but rather than describing the technical surface area, this machine readable definition format will describe the business surface area of an API.</p>

        <span class="post-date">12 Feb 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-differences.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>Evaluating exactly what is the "right" API can be very difficult. This is what I do full time, and its hard for me to understand the differences--I cannot image what it is like for people who have real jobs. I've used both the <a href="https://data.crunchbase.com/">Crunchbase API</a>, and the <a href="https://angel.co/api">AngelList API</a> for some time now, to help me better profile the companies that I am paying attention to as part of my research. I use both the website, and API for both of these business data platforms on a regular basis.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2016/02/10/crunchbase-raises-2m-series-a2-launches-paid-plans-for-data-access/">As I read about the recent investment in Crunchbase, and their changes in pricing</a>, I'm reminded of my half finished work, incorporating the <a href="https://api.opencorporates.com/">OpenCorporates API</a>, and taking another look at all of my business data sources. I won't be able to afford Crunchbase after the changes, which will suck, but honestly I'm not a big fan of their overall operations, and approach, and happy to see the data source leave <a href="http://stack.apievangelist.com/companies.html">the stack of APis that I depend on</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This leaves me assessing what is next, as any major API plan changes will do to consumers. In addition to needing the data behind each company I monitor in the API space, I need a public page to reference across my storytelling. It is unfortunate that I've used Crunchbase for this historically. In an effort to keep my readers informed, I've also been supporting the very closed (and increasingly so) platform. When I pick up my business API integration work, I will switch off Crunchbase, keep my AngelList feed, and turn on OpenCorporates, but I will also start using the public OpenCorporates page as the URL reference I use in my storytelling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For me, it is important to find the resources I need to run my business, but it is also important to support services that have healthy practices. I have an overall objective to have relevant business data on companies I monitor, something Crunchbase and AngelList has provided a portion of. However I am also having to weigh what information OpenCorporates provides me, and where this overlaps with, or is in addition to Crunchbase and AngelList. I will lose some valuable information when I turn off Crunchbase, that I will not be able to replace with OpenCorporates. This is ok. The ethical trade off, between supporting OpenCorporates and Crunchbase is worth it to me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://mattermark.com/api/">other sources of information like Mattermark</a>, but similar to the path Crunchbase is on, their services are priced out of range for small, startups like me, who really aren't playing in the VC game. OpenCorporates has a more tiered approach to pricing, making it more accessible to me, allowing me to get access to data, and scale sensibly, as my needs grow. OpenCorporates also also me to add data to their corporate database, which is something I will explore through an API lens in future stories. In this post, I just wanted to explore the obvious and subtle differences between these similar API providers who provide business information.</p>
<p>Each of these providers offer up different data points, coupled with <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">different API plans</a>, as well as <a href="http://licensing.apievangelist.com/">licensing</a> and <a href="http://tos.apievangelist.com">terms of service</a>. Understanding the differences takes some serious evaluation, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/10/exploring-the-possibilities-of-being-an-api-broker/">lending weight to the fact that many companies, and application developers will be needing API brokers in the future</a>. Why I choose one provider over another may not be be the same things other companies will be considering, as I have different objectives, but having as many details of these API operations profiled is important, to help other companies go through the same process that I am going through--something I will keep working on as the API Evangelist, through my <a href="http://theapistack.com/">API Stack work</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Feb 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/company/logos/postman-rest-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>One reason for having a well thought out, comprehensive API strategy, is that you are thinking about all the moving parts, and at ever turn you can weave things together, and potentially amplify the forward motion of your API operations. With every new release you should be considering all other areas of your API strategy, how you can include your API consumers, your partners, and where all of the opportunities lie when it comes to evangelism, and storytelling.</p>
<p>This approach <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/02/06/an-embeddable-run-in-postman-button-for-your-api/">was present in the latest release from Postman, with the release of their Run in Postman, embeddable button</a>. As part of the release of the new embeddable button for their API client tooling, Postman also made a call for partners. It was a savvy marketing technique to reach out to partners like this, something that will not just generate implementations in the wild, but will also establish new partnerships, strengthen existing ones, while also generating new blog posts, and press releases around API platform operations.</p>
<p>When it comes to the API Evangelist operations, the approach by Postman is gold--when I consider across many areas of my own strategy. Postman is showcased as part of my <a href="http://client.apievangelist.com/">API client research</a>, their product release exists within my <a href="http://embeddable.apievangelist.com/">embeddable API research</a>, and also lives within my <a href="http://evangelism.apievangelist.com/">API evangelism</a> and <a href="http://partners.apievangelist.com/">API partners research</a>. The moral of this story is Postman thought across their strategy when crafting the release strategy for their new feature, and I also put in similiar thoughts across my own strategy while reading their blog post, giving us both an opportunity for establishing biggest bang possible, around a single API platform release.</p>

<p>I was in Philadelphia last week, hanging out with educational technology practitioners, and at one of the dinners I found myself talking to a young lady who was a digital learning assistant at a university. She spent her days, helping administrators, and faculty, when it came to understanding what digital resources and tooling were available, and assisting them to better understand how they can put them to use in their daily work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This conversation left me thinking about the role I play in the API space. I long ago elevated myself above evangelizing any single APIs, a position I enjoy because of my partners <a href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a>, <a href="http://cloud-elements.com/">Cloud Element</a>, <a href="http://restlet.com/">Restlet</a>, and <a href="http://wso2.com">WSO2</a>. I elevated myself into this role because I saw nobody else doing it across the space, and saw an opportunity to make a wider impact, beyond just peddling a single product or service. My conversation in Philly made me realize how much general API assistant I am in my daily operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The role of an API assistant, helping others understand that APIs exist, and how they can be applied in our everyday personal and business lives is an increasingly critical role in our society. How do you teach people they can pull corporate data from <a href="https://opencorporates.com/">OpenCorporates</a>, or Tweets from a specific #hashtag into a Google Spreadsheet? How do you help people understand that APIs make the everyday exhaust from your world <br />organize-able", accessible, and more "orchestrate-able", via APIs--without knowing how to code!</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/10/exploring-the-possibilities-of-being-an-api-broker/">I've talked about my work as an API broker, where I help organize coherent stacks of APIs, for potential use in specific business verticals, and web, mobile, or even device based applications</a>. I'm adding API assistance to this spectrum now, because an API broker addresses the professional business side of the API equation, but an API assistance addresses the individual side of the API equation. I hope this schism in my own existence as API evangelist, broker, and assistant, is also addressed at organizations, and independently in the API space, because we are sure going to need more expertise at these levels, if we are going to make all of this work.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span></p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Feb 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-write-description.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I look at a lot of APIs, and one characteristic I judge them by, is their ability to simply explain what their API does. The most import aspect to any individual or company when doing APIs, is the process can potentially bring you out of your bubble, and make you think a little bit more externally.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the most common things I see from API providers, is they think it terms of, and present their API in the context of the language they program in. It is a ".NET Web API", or a Python API. When in reality it is a web API, and if it employs enough HTTP, it should be able to be consumed in any language.</p>
<p>Another regular mistake made by API providers, is they describe their API in terms of their own platform, and never actually tell you what it does. Here is an example of this from <a href="https://docs.pushbullet.com/">PushBullet</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Pushbullet's API enables developers to build on the Pushbullet infrastructure. Our goal is to provide a full API that enables anything to tap into the Pushbullet network.</em></p>
<p>While I appreciate the short description of what the API does, I'm left still not knowing what it does. You see, I do not know about Pushbullet like you do, and chances are neither will many of your other potential API consumers. Knowing about your company shouldn't get in the way of me learning about what your API does.</p>
<p>To me, this is classic walled silo-itis, where programmers are operating within their little company or tech silo, and don't look much further. That is ok, this is why we do APis, to help break you free of these cycles.&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Feb 2016</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.algolia.com/pricing"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/algolia-logo.png" alt="" width="25%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I am continuing to push forward my <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com">API plans research</a>, where I look closely at the common building blocks of the service composition, pricing, and plans available for some of the leading API providers out there. I have no less than ten separate stories derived from <a href="https://www.algolia.com/pricing">Algolia, the search API provider's, pricing page</a>--I will be using Algolia as a reference for how to plan your API, along with elder API pioneers like Amazon, and Twilio, for some time now.</p>
<p>On area of Algolia's approach I think is worth noting, is the enterprise level of their operations. They provide the most detail regarding what you get as part of the enterprise tier, being very public about their operations, in a way you just do not see with many API providers. When it comes down to it, the Algolia enterprise search plans are all about no limitations--I think their description says it well:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Your own dedicated infrastructure. Don't like limits? Meet our dedicated clusters. Optimal for high volumes of data, they scale to thousands of queries per second. Search performance and indexing times have never been so good.</em></p>
<p>The basic building blocks of how Algolia is monetizing their search API, records and operation API calls, melt away at the enterprise level. The lower four plans for Algolia API access meter the number of record, and operation API calls you make, and charge consumers, using four separate pricing levels. If you are an enterprise customer, the need for this metering melts away, eliminating the default limitations applied to lower levels of API consumption.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.algolia.com/pricing"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/enterprise-solutions.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>I support more transparency in enterprise API plans, as well as other <a href="http://partners.apievangelist.com">partner tiers of access</a>. I do not think Algolia's approach to delivering enterprise services is unique, but their straightforward, simple, and transparent approach to doing it is. In an API driven world, the enterprise levels of access do not always have to be that age old mating dance, that involves smoke and mirrors, and pricing pulled out of a magic hat--it can be just be about reducing the limitations around retail levels of API access, and getting business done.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.getpostman.com/2016/01/28/the-run-in-postman-button-for-improved-documentation/">The popular API client tool Postman just launched an embeddable "run in Postman" button</a>, that you can use to fast track integration with your API(s). Shortly after <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/12/19/button-to-run-this-api-in-the-http-api-client-of-my-choice/">I wrote a post about the importance of API definition driven embeddable tools for API service providers</a>, Postman contacted me and said, "hey! we are already working on that!" ;-)</p>
<p>With the latest update, when you use your Postman Client, you can generate some embeddable JavaScript, which you can then post alongside your API documentation, throughout your developer portal, or possibly anywhere on the open web. Something that could trim minutes, or even hours off the time it takes for new developers to go from discovery to integration.</p>
<p><a href="http://embeddable.apievangelist.com">Embeddable</a> tooling for APIs is nothing new, something we've seen leading providers like Twitter and Facebook employ successfully, but it is something that is fairly new for API service providers. Having a robust embeddable strategy like this one from Postman, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/01/27/embedding-your-language-sdks-in-your-apiary-documentation-using-apimatic/">last week's example from SDK provider APIMATIC</a>, is something all API service providers should be considering in 2016.</p>

        <span class="post-date">05 Feb 2016</span>
        <p><a href="http://developer.factual.com/data-docs/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/factual-developers.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>One of the approaches to <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">API plans</a> I was studying recently is from the data provider <a href="http://developer.factual.com">Factual</a>, who provides access to places, products, and other valuable data-sets. I felt Factual had a pretty straightforward approach to the free tier of access for their platform, that was worthy of sharing.</p>
<p><a href="http://developer.factual.com/data-docs/">When you visit the page for the Factual data services</a>, they offer two distinct levels of free access to data resources:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Free (unverified) -</strong>&nbsp;Up to 100 read requests per day. No access to resolve or write APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Free (verified) -</strong>&nbsp;Up to 10,000 requests per day for most tables.</li>
</ul>
<p>When I look at the plans for many APIs, they almost always have free tiers of access, but normally there is just one dimension to it. You get a certain amount of API calls per second, day, or month, for free. What is unique about the approach from Factual is they offer another free level, which gives you more API calls if you verify yourself--this is a pretty interesting approach, that other providers should consider.</p>
<p><a href="http://developer.factual.com/data-docs/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/factual-data-services-overview.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>You want free access, but don't want to verify yourself, and you get 100 red requests per day, but if you go through <a href="http://www.factual.com/keys/verify">the verification process</a>, you get 10,000 requests per day--a pretty significant difference. I am talking with a number of providers lately about how they are tightening up the free tiers of API access, and working to incentivize users to become paying customers, which made me take another look at Factual's approach.</p>
<p>I think free access to APIs is essential to operations, but I think providers need to be more thoughtful about just how much of their resources they give away at this tier. It is OK if you want to get to know your consumers, before you give away too much of the farm. There can be a lot of bad behavior from API consumers at the free tier level, and developer verification is one way you can minimize the impact on your API operations.</p>

        <span class="post-date">05 Feb 2016</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/charles-proxy/reclaim-charles-proxy.png" alt="" width="50%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I have been working hard for about a year now trying to craft machine readable API definitions for the leading APIs out there. I've <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/21/parsing-charles-proxy-exports-to-generate-swagger-definitions-while-also-linking-them-to-each-path">written before about my use of Charles Proxy to generate OpenAPI Spec files</a>, something I'm evolving over the last couple days, making it more automated, and hopefully making my mapping of the API universe much more efficient.</p>
<p>Hand crafting even the base API definition for any API is time consuming, which is something that swells quickly to being hours when you consider the finish work that required, so I was desperately looking how I could automate this aspect of my operations more. I have two modes when looking at an API, review mode where I'm documenting the API and its surrounding operations, with the second being about actually using the API. While I will still be reviewing APIs, my goal is to immediately begin actually using an API, where I feel most of the value is at, while also kicking off the documentation process in the same motion.</p>
<p><strong>Logging All Of My Traffic Using Charles Proxy On Machine</strong><br />Using <a href="http://www.charlesproxy.com/">Charles Proxy</a>, I route all of my network traffic on my Macbook Pro through a single proxy which I am in control of, allowing me to log every Internet location my computer visits throughout the day. It is something I cannot leave running 100% of the time, as it breaks certificates, sets of security warnings from a number of destinations, but is something I can run about 75% of my world through--establishing a pretty interesting map of the resources I consume, and produce on each day.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/charles-proxy/relciam-charles-proxy-auto-save-settings.png" alt="" width="50%" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>Auto Saving Charles Proxy Session Files Every 30 Minutes</strong><br />While running running Charles Proxy, I have it setup to auto save a session XML every 30 minutes, giving me bite size snapshots of transaction throughout my day. I turn Charles Proxy on or off, depending on what I am doing. I selected to save as a session XML file because after looking at each format, I felt it had the information I needed, while also easily imported into my database back end.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Leverage Dropbox Sync And API To Process Session Files</strong><br />The session XML files generated by Charles Proxy get saved into my local Dropbox folder on my Macbook Pro. Dropbox does the rest, it syncs all of my session XML files to the cloud, securely stored in a single application folder. This allows me to easily generate profiles of websites and APIs, and something that passively occurs in the background while I work on specific research. The only time Dropbox will connect and sync my files, is when I have Charles Proxy off, otherwise it can't establish a secure connection.</p>
<p><strong>Custom API To Process Session Files Available In Dropbox</strong><br />With network traffic logged, and stored in the cloud using Dropbox, I can then access them via the Dropbox API. To handle this work, I setup an API that will check the specified Dropbox app folder, associated with its Dropbox API application access, and import any new files that it finds. Once a file has been processed, I delete it from Dropbox, dumping any personally identifiable information that may have been present--however, I am not doing banking, or other vital things with Charles Proxy on.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/charles-proxy/reclaim-store-charles-proxy-files-in-dropbox.png" alt="" width="50%" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>Custom API To Organize Transactions By Host &amp; Media Type</strong><br />I now have all my logged transactions stored in a database, and I can begin to organize them by host, and media type--something I'm sure I will evolve with time. To facilitate this process I have created a custom API that allows me to see each unique domain or sub-domain that I visit during my logging with Charles Proxy. I am mostly interested in API traffic, so I'm looking for JSON, XML, and other API related media types. I do not process any image, and many other common media types, but do log traffic to HTML sites, routing into a separate bucket which I describe below.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Custom API To Generate OpenAPI Spec For Each Transaction</strong><br />In addition to storing the primary details for each transaction I log, for each transaction with a application/json response, I auto-generate an OpenAPI Spec file, mapping out the surface area of the API endpoint. The goal is to provide a basic, machine readable definition of the transaction, so that I can group by host, and other primary details I'm tracking on. This is the portion of the process that generates the map I need for the API universe.</p>
<p><strong>Custom API To Generate JSON Schema For Each Transaction</strong><br />In addition to generating an OpenAPI Spec for&nbsp;each transaction that I track on with a application/json response, I generate a JSON Schema for the JSON returned. This allows me to map out what data is being returned, without it containing any of the actual data itself. I will do the same for any request body as well, providing a JSON Schema definition for what data is being sent as well as received within any transaction that occurs during my Charles Proxy monitoring.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/charles-proxy/reclaim-charles-proxy-process-files.png" alt="" width="50%" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>Automation Of Process Using The EasyCRON Layer Of Platform</strong><br />I now have four separate APIs that help me automate the logging of my network traffic, storing, processing of all transactions I record, then automatically generate an OpenAPI Spec, and JSON Schema for each API call. This provides me with a more efficient way to kick off the API documentation process, automatically generating machine readable API definitions and data schema, from the exhaust of my daily work, which includes numerous API calls, for a wide variety different reasons.</p>
<p><strong>Helping Me Map Out The World Of Web APIs As The API Evangelist</strong><br />The primary goal of this work is to help me map out the world of APIs, as part of my work as the API Evangelist. Using this process, all I have to do is turn on Charles Proxy, fire up my Postman, visit an API I want to map out, and start using the API. Usually within an hour, I will then have an Open API Spec for each transaction, as well as aggregated by host, along with a supporting JSON Schema for the underlying request or response data model--everything I need to map out more APIs, more efficient scaling what I do.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Helping Me Understand The Media Types In Use Out There Today</strong><br />One thing I noticed right away, was the variety of media types I was coming across. At first I locked things down to application/json, but then I realized I wanted XML, and others. So I reversed my approach and let through all media-types, and started building a blacklist for which ones I did not want to let through. Leaving this part of the process open, and requiring manual evaluation of media types is really pushing forward my awarnesss of alternative media types, and is something that was an unexpected aspect to this owrk.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/charles-proxy/reclaim-process-transactions.png" alt="" width="50%" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>Helping Me Understand The Companies I Use Daily In My Business</strong><br />It is really interesting to see the list of hosts that I have generated as part of this work. Some of these companies I depend on for applications that I depend on like Tweetdeck, Github, and Dropbox, while others are companies I'm looking to learn more about as part of API Evangelist research, and storytelling. I'm guessing this understanding of the companies that I'm using daily in my work will continue to evolve significantly as I continue looking at the world through this lens.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Helping Me Understand The Data I Exchange Daily With Companies</strong><br />The host of each transaction gives me a look at the companies I transact with daily, but the JSON Schema derived from request and responses that are JSON, also giving me an interesting look at the information I'm exchanging in my daily operations, either directly with platforms I depend on, or casually with websites I visit, and the web applications I'm testing out. I have a lot of work ahead of me to actually catalog, organized and derive meaning from the schema I am generating, but at least I have them in buckets for further evaluation in the near future.</p>
<p><strong>Routing Websites That I Visit Into A Separate Bucket For Tracking On</strong><br />At first I was going to just ditch all GET requests that returned HTML, but instead I decided to log these transactions, keeping the host, path, and parameters in a separate media type bucket. While I won't be evaluating these domains like I do the APIs that return JSON, XML, etc, I will be keeping an eye on them. I'm feeding these URLs into my core monitoring system, and for some companies I will pull their blog RSS, Twitter handles, and Github accounts, in addition to looking for other artifacts like OpenAPI Specs, API Blueprints, Postman Collections, APIs.json, and other machine readable goodies.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/charles-proxy/reclaim-open-api-spec.png" alt="" width="50%" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>Targeting Of Specific Web, Mobile, Device, And API Driven Platforms</strong><br />Now that I have this new, more automated API mapping system setup, it will encourage me to target specific web mobile, devices, and API platforms. I will be routing my iPhone, and iPad through the proxy, allowing me to map out mobile applications. If I can just get to work using an API in my Postman client, or use the website or mobile app, and auto-generate a map of the APIs in use in OpenAPI Spec, and data models using JSON Schema, you are going to find me mapping a number of new platform targets in 2016.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ok, So What Now? What Am I Going To Do With This Mapping Info Next?</strong><br />You know, I'm not sure what is next. I learned a lot from this 25 hour sprint, to better automate this process. I think I will just sit back and let it run for a week or two, and do what I regularly do. Visit the websites and developer areas of platforms that I'm keeping an eye on. I will keep using APIs to run my own operations, as well as play with as many APIs as I possibly can fit into my days. Periodically I will check it to see how my new API mapping system is working, and see if I can't answer some pressing questions I have:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>How much do I create vs. consume? ie. POST, PUT &amp; PATCH over GET?</li>
<li>How often do I use my own resources vs the API resources of others?</li>
<li>Do I have any plan B or C for all resources I am using?</li>
<li>Do I agree with the terms of service for these platforms I am using?</li>
<li>Do I pay any of the services that are a regular part of my daily operations?</li>
<li>Am I in control of my account and data for these platforms &amp; companies?</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/charles-proxy/reclaim-json-schema.png" alt="" width="50%" align="right" /></p>
<p>For the moment, I am just looking at establish a map of the digital surface area I touch on each day, and further scale my ability to map out unknown areas of the API wildnerness. I am curious to see how many OpenAPISpecs and JSON Schemas I can generate in a week or month now. I have no idea how I'm going to store or organize all of these maps of the API sector, but it is something I'm sure I can find a solution for using my <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json format</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the type of work I really enjoy. It involves scaling what I do, better understanding what already exists out there, something that will fuel my storytelling, and is something that pushes me to code, and craft custom APIs, while also employing other open tooling, formats, and services along the way--this is API Evangelist.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Feb 2016</span>
        <p>I am continuing to work through notes from a recent push forward of my <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/">API monetization</a>, and <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">API plan</a> research. Something that yielded a number of valuable nuggets &nbsp;that I think API providers should be considering when crafting their own strategy. <a href="https://auth0.com/pricing">One of the pricing pages I was looking at as part of my research, was from authentication provider Auth0, which provided a nice way for allowing their customers to toggle between monthly or annual pricing</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://auth0.com/pricing"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/auth0-pricing-switch.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">I organize small elements like this, into my lists of common API building blocks, which help API providers, and API service providers, with a list of things they can consider applying in their own strategies</a>. I like the approach from Auth0 especially, because the toggle actually changes the plan pricing on the page, reflecting the shorter, or longer term costs associated with their authentication services.</p>
<p>Whether your intent is to offer price breaks for longer term relationships, or helping your customers better understand and manage their costs, a simple thing like a time-frame toggle, that adjusts pricing, could make a positive impact. Anyhoo, I just wanted to share this nugget with you, as I was adding it as a <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">building block to my API plan research</a>.</p>

<p>I'm going to keep beating the patent API drumbeat, until I bring more awareness to the topic, and shine a light on what is going on. While I will still be my usual self and call out the worst behavior in the space, I am also going to try and be a little more friendlier around my views, and try and help bring more options to the table. This is a serious problem, nobody is talking about, and one that has many dimensions and nuances--<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/01/27/my-stance-on-apis-and-patents/">if you want my raw stance on API patents, you can read it here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One area I wanted to try and cover, in response to my friends trying to convince me their aren't bad people, in having patents. I know you aren't, and it isn't my goal to make you look bad in this, it is only to shine light on the entire process, how broken it is, and call out the worst offenders. If you truly believe in patents, protecting the work you've done, and that your intentions are good, share your patent portfolio with the world, and showcase it like you do the other aspects of the work you do. You will craft a press release about everything else you do, do the same for your patents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not think patents are bad. I think ill-conceived patent ideas, that haven't been properly vetted by the under resourced USPTO, that are used in back door dealings as leverage, and litigated in a court of law are bad. I'll take your word that your patents are good, and you aren't operating in any of these areas, if you are public, transparent, and openly proud of them, as you state in private conversations.</p>
<p>Part of the purpose of my research is to encourage good behavior in the sector, by highlight the common building blocks of the space. I think I will add a patent portfolio building to my research. While I have ZERO examples to highlight, I encourage API companies to do this, and would love to highlight in a positive way, any company that is straight up enough to showcase their patents. If you are proud of your API patents, and do not have bad intentions in having them, please publish your portfolio, show case them as you would anything else you are doing--help bring API patents out of the shadows.</p>

        <span class="post-date">29 Jan 2016</span>
        <p><a href="http://blog.parse.com/announcements/moving-on/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/parse-moving-on.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://blog.parse.com/announcements/moving-on/">The mobile backend as a service (MBaaS) platform Parse is shutting down</a>. I started tracking on Parse as part of my BaaS research a couple years back, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/02/25/the-baas-reality-tv-show-panel-at-apistrat/">something that resulted in having all of the BaaS providers, including Ilya Sukhar (@) of Parse, on stage at @APIStrat NYC in early 2013</a>--this conversation was just a couple months before Parse was acquired by Facebook.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parse was widely consider to be the top BaaS platform, which resulted in wide adoption, something that I'm sure grew expoentitally after the purchase by Facebook. Parse is giving everyone a year to migrate, <a href="http://blog.parse.com/announcements/introducing-parse-server-and-the-database-migration-tool/">providing a database migration tool</a>, as well as <a href="http://blog.parse.com/announcements/introducing-parse-server-and-the-database-migration-tool/">open sourcing a version of the platform</a>. Which I think is a pretty fair deprecation strategy for customers, even with the unexpected news.</p>
<p>Despite the tec highway is littered with these types of acquisitions, and deprecations, the tech blogosphere, and social bookmarkosphere (is that a word?), loves to sqawk when these happen. Competitors like AWS, Google, and others love to invite you to come use their platform, and the technorati love to point out how you cannot depend on any platform--which is the truth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personally, I enjoy taking these moments to explore why the space think technology is such an asbsolute, where these ways of thought rarely exist in other sectors<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/01/where-do-developers-get-idea-that-apis-should-never-go-away/">.</a>&nbsp;I think there are a couple distinct things at play:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Promises Of Tech Providers -</strong> In an effort to get new users, tech solution providers make some pretty wild promises of how they'll make your life easier, do all the hard work for you, all you have to do is just believe in them. Never mentioning you aren't really their true target customer, an acquisition by big tech company is their true customer.</li>
<li><strong>Religious Belief In Technology -</strong> Like the marketing of providers, developers, and other folks who drink the Silicon Valley Kool-Aid, really, really, really belive that technology is the answer, it will save us, and all of this is inevitable. Thus we believe the tech will always be there to save us, and are so willing to ignore the actual business and politics of all of this.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/01/where-do-developers-get-idea-that-apis-should-never-go-away/">As I've stated in earlier posts, there are no guarantees your vendors will will always be there in other business sectors, what the hell makes us think our tech vendors will always be there</a>? There is no basis for believing a platform or API will ALWAYS be there, no matter what you are promised. Companies go out of business, get acquired, and in this fast paced tech climate, companies are always looking to deliver the latest product, and features. Everything in the space points to disruption, change, and evolution, where the hell did we get the idea these services shouldn't go away?</p>
<p>I think the tech blogosphere, social&nbsp;bookmarkosphere, and startup elite and belivers should lower our expectations of technology just a little bit. ternet outages, acquisitions, and roadmap shifts will always happen--seems to me, these are the only constants! As a small business operator (I am not a startup), I am constantly evaluating what my Plan B, C, D, E, and even F is. While I may not always be prepared for changes in the landscape, rarely you will catch me squawking too loudly, as I'm business executing on the next stage of my evolution.</p>
<p>However, you will hear me exploring, and understanding these topics, as they occur--because that is fun, and educational!</p>

        <p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/29/the-api-lifecycle-my-talk-from-defrag-and-apistrat/">If you caught my keynotes at @Defrag and @APIStrat last year, you know I'm working on using the subway map as a method for visualizing, understand, and eventually exploration of the API life cycle</a>. I feel like the subway map concept, has helped us find a globally universal way of understanding the transport of humans, via some very complex transportation systems, in cities around the globe--something I feel can be applied to world of APIs.</p>
<p>I was giving a version of my API life cycle talk to a group in Finland the other evening (their morning), and someone in the audience sent me <a href="http://liikenne.hylly.org/rata/lahi/">a link to the real-time subway map for Helsinki</a>. If you watch it closely, it updates based upon where the trains are, sharing times and locations.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://liikenne.hylly.org/rata/lahi/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/helsinki-subway-map.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Click To See Real Interactive Map</em></p>
<p>This is what I'm working for across the API space. I see the subway map analogy being key to <a href="http://apievangelist.com">understanding our API life cycle, across the 40+ areas I track on in my research</a>, as well as a potential real-time window to understanding how each API is being used by employing <a href="http://3scale.net">modern API management infrastructure like 3Scale</a>.</p>
<p>API providers (which ALL companies will be shortly) should have real-time windows into where each of their vital API resources are in the life cycle, whether they are being designed, developed, managed or deprecated. We should also be able to experience real-time views of how are APIs are being consumed, which apps are currently making calls, and potentially even security threats against our API infrastructure.</p>
<p>The subway map is also providing me a way to educate new, and existing API folks in the space, providing them with an interactive journey within the design, definition, deployment, management, monitoring, <a href="http://apievangelist.com">and 40+ other areas of the API life cycle I keep an eye on</a>. I'm optimistic for what is possible, when it comes to applying the subway map concept to the world of APIs, but like earlier subway engineers, I think it will take some time before I fight just the right approach. ;-)</p>

<p>Supporting your community is not unique to the API space, but supporting API operations does have some unique needs, and approaches that are proven by leading platforms. Like other areas of my research, I'm pulling out API support into its own area, so I can start shining a light on successful patterns I find in the area of API support.</p>
<p>Two things pushed me to spin out this research area. One, I was tagging more blog posts, and other resources as support, and without a dedicated research area, this information would rarely float to the surface for me. Two, <a href="http://cloud-elements.com/hubs/help-desk-hub/">my partners over at Cloud Elements have an API hub dedicated to "Help Desk"</a>. While their aggregate API solution is targeting beyond the API community, it is API driven, and can also be applied to providing an aggregate support solution for API communities.</p>
<p>As with most of the areas of the API space, there are several dimensions to how APIs are being applied to support customers, and online communities. With my research, I will focus on tracking on approaches to community support for API providers, and API service providers. There will also be that layer of tracking on help desk and support platforms who employ APIs, as well as API aggregate and API interoperability solutions from leaders (and my partners) in the space like <a href="http://cloud-elements.com/">Cloud Elements</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.apievangelist.com">You can visit my API support research via its Github repository</a>, and I will try to make sure and continue linking to it from my <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/">API management research</a>, where it was born out of.</p>

        <span class="post-date">27 Jan 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-certificate.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/01/12/i-just-cannot-get-behind-api-patents-especially-when-they-apply-to-http-and-hypermedia/">My post the other day on the hypermedia API focused patents from ElasticPath</a>, has resulted in some very interesting conversations, with folks trying to understand this world, to those who are patent believers, and those who are just doing what they have to--in a world they do not control. This is why I write these stories, and frankly, it is why I am looking to push the patent conversation to new levels, to bring all y'all out of the woodwork.</p>
<p>In a collective response to these conversations, I wanted to share my stance on patents, when it comes to the world of APIs. Let's start closer to the median, and talk about patents, and the world that "exists today", and explore the common responses when you look to discuss API patents in the current climate.</p>
<p><strong>I Do Not Want To Do Patents, I Only Do Them As a Defensive Response!</strong><br />C'mon Kin! You do not understand why we have to do patents. We only do them to protect our space, against the worst, of the worst in the tech space--you know SAP, Sun, Oracle, Microsoft, IBM, and the other evil that lurk (<a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com/companies.html">the ones with most patents</a>). I get it. It is the same reason all my redneck, and now hippie friends own guns--those over there have guns, and I need to defend myself. You never know when one of those situations will happen, and I will need to defend what I've invested so much to build.</p>
<p><strong>I Need To Generate Intellectual Property (IP), Because It Is How We Define Value!</strong><br />If I could spend my time as I wish, I wouldn't be writing up patents, and spending money on the patent process. My investors, CEO, and my wider stakeholder's expect that, as a startup, I patent the most valuable of the exhaust from our operations. Ok. So you do this because the people who give you money tell you to? Or do you do this because it actually defines the value you generate as a startup? So, as a startup in 2015, a process acknowledged in ancient Greece, and evolved after the dark ages, and further refined in the industrial age, define you? Ok. #DisruptionW00T!</p>
<p><strong>Patents Are How You Make Money, Do You Know How Much Money IBM, Microsoft, SAP and Others Make?</strong><br />The amount of money the large enterprise make off their patent portfolios is in the BILLIONS! This is how business gets done, and fortunes are made! This is how the leading companies that we hold up as shining examples make their billions, so why wouldn't I follow in their footsteps? Well, you know, all that disruption, innovation, and other bullshit you hear--that is why! Actually its not, but I'm just trying to use your own marketing against you, to try and change your tune.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Let's Start With The Basic Differences Between Your View, And My View Of The Space</strong><br />The concept of the patent process is about taking a unique and innovative process, locking it up, and preventing others from doing it. Which in a capitalist, physical world might make some sense, some of the time, but in a digital world it actually works against the way things actually operate--where reuse, interoperability, and global access is how you reach a wider audience, encourage ubiquitous integration, and yes make money (open source duh?). Locking things up, preventing others from using a successful pattern, and metering that usage doesn't get you as far in this digital world, as it did in the physical world of manufacturing and distribution. #Sorry</p>
<p>In conflict with your world of patents, I am in the business of opening things up, reducing friction, increasingly interoperability, educating more people, and making things work together. I like to make money, but in the end, I'm more in the business of making you money, than I am about making money--you just do not realize it. You are are so short sighted in your view of business, that you do not get what API is. You think SOA didn't work because of some technical flaw, and ignore the role your heavy hand has played in gumming up the gears. Only now are you noticing that API is even working, and you know what? It has nothing to do with you. It has been working because of your absence, and now that your heavy hand has come into play, trust me, shit will slow down. #GiveItTime</p>
<p><strong>The Patent Process Is Broken And Few Actually Care (Or Willing To Talk)</strong><br />The biggest thing that bothers me in taking my patent stance, and challenging the larger world of patents, is that the process is broken, and that many know, few care, and even fewer are willing to talk about it. Let's start with the basics, in that a process developed in the physical world, applied to physical processes, is transferable to the digital world with no adjustments. WTF! You will argue that taking an existing patent applied in the physical world, reapplied to web or mobile is now worthy of a new patent, but the patent process itself doesn't warrant the same response? WTF! #Broken. We could leave it there, but wait, there is more!</p>
<p><strong>The US Patent Office Is Underfunded, Undertrained, And OverWhelmed With Demand</strong><br />When you take the time to look through the work that goes into looking for prior works, you realize how little actually goes into the overall patent vetting process. Its less about invalidating an idea for a patent, than it is about make sure it gets approved. The USPTO is just one casualty in a larger war to defund the United States government, and part of the beautiful gift the 1% receives in waging this war. This the how power works. Weaken the process, defund the regulators, and give the power to those who own the patent. You are either smart and innovating, or you are a loser right? #VoteTrump</p>
<p><strong>Patents Are A Rich Persons Game, Something The Rest Of Us Should Avoid</strong><br />The patent game is for those with the resources, on the front-end and on the back-end. Do you have the time to carve out and define your patent, hire a lawyer to write and file your patent? Do you have the time to wait for the USPTO to approve your patent? Are you filing your patent, or is the company you work for filing the patent? You do!! Now do you have the time, and resources to defend your patent, upon attack by your enemies, in a court of law? A sustained attack? This is the two-sided beauty of how patents are a rich person game. You have to have what it takes to gneerate patents to please your VCs, and to defend against your perceived enemies, but do you also have what it takes to defend in the real world, in a court of law? I do not. Even if I could afford to patent my unique process on patenting APis, I couldn't litigate it ;-)</p>
<p><strong>Nobody Wants To Talk About Patents, Because Someday I Need Funding, Or Will Be In The Club</strong><br />Blogs like Techcrunch love to do gotcha stories, when it helps the cause of the powers that pull their strings, and similar publications will call foul when really scary patent related cases enters the legal system, but patent filing, and approved applications, in even the scariest of ways rarely make the news. As a patent filer or owner, you rarely talk about your patent portfolio publicly, let alone feed this information to news outlets, and interestingly, very few organizations go looking for this information. Hmmmm....</p>
<p><strong>Patent Conversations Happen Behind Closed Doors, Way Before They Ever Enter A Court Of Law</strong><br />When I hear the statement that patents are being filed in a defensive posture, focusing in on the legal battles that will no doubt come in the future, from the most aggressive in the space--I hear the passive aggressive tones from the shadows (takes one to know one). This statement leaves out the posturing that takes place behind closed doors, between executives, and investors. Do not tell me your patent portfolio, or perceived patent portfolio (patent pending) doesn't give you leverage in every day dealings, never even bringing litigation into the picture.</p>
<p><strong>Are Patents Sending The Signals You Think They Are In the Space</strong>&nbsp;<br />I just can't help but think that even though companies are playing the "patent game" by the rules, that they fully understand the signals they are sending. if I am watching the patent filings, and application approvals, and I know you are, don't you think your competition, and potential enemies are? Are you better off gaining a first mover advantage with your "unique process", or are you better off filing a patent for your process? IDK. I'm guessing this depends on how big your company is, and your general position in the space. Which means, I'm guessing it might not mean what you think it means for your little startup, and your view of the value vs. the view of your VC's might differ. Maybe it actually makes you a target for other types of bad behavior, and in the end, if necessary some actual patent litigation.</p>
<p><strong>Patents Are Like Guns, I'm Doing Them Because Everyone Else Is Doing Them</strong><br />Each time I listened to the stories of why my friends are doing patents over the last week, I think about the same stories I mentioned above from friends on why they have guns. Only difference is I have a long history with guns (love em), and not so much with patents. My friends have guns, because there are many other bad guys out there with guns, creating this really amazingly hostile environment, where nobody is safe. As a former thug, guess where you go rob when you see yourself as top tog in a market? You go rob the guys with all the guns, who might not have the resources to actually defend them. Guns have enjoyed much more "need" in the past, much like patents, but in the current climate we live in, we need to reassess their role, not do away with them, just take another look at the process involved--we should do the same with patents.</p>
<p><strong>Patent Trolls Is Just The Illness Coming To the Surface Of Tech Space</strong><br />The reason patent trolls can exist in this environment, is because of the buy / sell nature of companies, the scale at which the USPTO is equipped, government downsized, and coming down to who can actually afford the lawyers in the on-boarding, as well as offensive or defensive portion of the long patent game. If you have ever seen patent litigation play out, you know such a small portion of it is ever public, so what we hear publicly about the problem, is a very small piece of what is going on. This is just the part that plays out in the courtroom, and NEVER touches on what happens in the boardrooms of leading tech companies, or the investors behind the curtain.</p>
<p><strong>Now We Get To The Part Where You Actually Hear My Stance On The Patents As They Apply To APIs</strong><br />The concept of patent is broken, and the process that is patent is broken. For this reason I do not believe in it. Then you add the fact that it is a rich persons game, seals the deal for me. I cannot afford a patent, even if I wanted to, something that makes it an agent of power in my world. Something that also makes it such a hypocritical tell for startups. Why don't you push out press releases on your patents, that your VC's require you do? Alongside all of the innovation and disruption press releases? Oh yeah, we are using this really old process of the existing power structure. That is right, we aren't actually that proud of our patents--unless we work for IBM.</p>
<p><strong>I Cannot Support This Concept Moving Forward If Nobody Will Stand Up And Fight To Evolve It</strong><br />As a startup you will dismiss history, so that you can disrupt, find your funding, and convince all of us that your thing, is a thing. Government, banks, unions, institutions, and other entrenched entities are bad, and need disrupting in a digital era, but this centuries old process of locking of business processes, developing intellectual property, and building wealth portfolio deserves NO CHANGE in a digital age? WTF? Are you serious? The same concept applied to the cotton gin, applies to my cotton gin API? Don't even think about it, I've already applied for the patent! ;-) Sorry, I'm just not sold.</p>
<p>I understand why you are doing this, and I will keep accepting your requests to talk about, because I learn a lot along the way, and it is something that continues to anchor me in my stance. You will look to quickly dismiss me because I am not "playing in your league", and I don't understand the stakes, and the rules of the game. #Truth. I would also challenge that maybe you are so caught up in the stakes and rules of your game, you might be missing some opportunity, and potentially a whole other way of operating--one that actually makes all of this work, and less about you getting rich.</p>

        <span class="post-date">27 Jan 2016</span>
        <p><a href="http://apimatic.io"></a><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/company/logos/apimatic-logo.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>I'm seeing a resurgence in my <a href="http://embeddable.apievangelist.com">embeddable API research</a> lately, based upon signals I'm seeing across the space, and conversations I'm having with folks. The interesting part for me is that this wave isn't about API providers like Twitter and Faceobok using JavaScript to create buttons, badges, and widgets. This latest round is about API service providers making their services more accessible to both API providers, and API consumers, using embeddable tooling, and most importantly, <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">API definitions</a>.</p>
<p>API driven embeddable tools comes in many shapes and sizes, but is something I work hard to understand, and track on in the space. I have several new embeddable stories to talk about this week, but today's is from my friends over at <a href="http://apimatic.io">APIMATIC</a>, as well as <a href="http://apiary.io">Apiary</a>. The two service providers now offer the ability to embed your APIMATIC driven SDKs, into your Apiary driven API documentation. All you do, is plug in the URL of your Apiary portal page for your API, into your APIMATC account, and you are returned embeddable markdown you can paste into your Apiary API documentation--Apiary addresses your API design, documentation, testing and virtualization needs, and APIMATIC comes is with the API SDK assist.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://apimatic.io/account/manage/apiary"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/apimatic-apiary-embed.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>I like API service providers working together like this, it is something that makes API provider's and API consumer's lives easier. This approach to API service interoperability is what it will take to weave together the patchwork of API services that will be needed across the API life cycle. As more API service providers emerge to fill gaps in the life cycle, the ability to stitch these stops will grow more critical, something embeddability will contribute to. Depending on a single provider in 2016, is just not a reality, and I need the services that I depend on to work together.</p>
<p>As I will work to showcase in future stories, embedability comes in many shapes and sizes. I'm hoping we are on the cusp of a new wave of <a href="http://embeddable.apievangelist.com">API driven embeddability</a>, one that is exponentially more fruitful, and easier to implement for each individual API provider. An approach to using JavaScript and image driven embeddability, that uses APIs like previous waves, but this one is more designed for API providers, API consumers, as well as for end-users, like historical approaches to embed like Twitter tweet buttons, and Facebook share and login buttons were.</p>

        <p><a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/events/cl74hjb3vikaorq1o506seejl7s">I held a hangout with API Evangelist this morning</a>, with Steve Willmot (<a class="twitter-atreply pretty-link js-nav" dir="ltr" href="https://twitter.com/njyx"><span>@</span>njyx</a>)<span> of </span><a class="twitter-atreply pretty-link js-nav" dir="ltr" href="https://twitter.com/3scale"><span>@</span>3scale</a><span>, &amp; Jakub Nesetril (</span><a class="twitter-atreply pretty-link js-nav" dir="ltr" href="https://twitter.com/jakubnesetril"><span>@</span>jakubnesetril</a>)<span> of </span><a class="twitter-atreply pretty-link js-nav" dir="ltr" href="https://twitter.com/apiaryio"><span>@</span>apiaryio</a><span>&nbsp;today, where we discussed API definitions. Both Steve and Jakub are CEOs of leading tech companies, who are taking frontline positions when it comes to the whole API definition conversation.</span></p>
<p>My role in this hangout, was just bringing together these two API leaders, to discuss the most important topic facing us in the world of APIs. API definitions are touching on every aspect of the API life cycle, and as Steve and Jakub discuss, playing a central role in their businesses, and their customer's businesses. We published the hour and half conversation on Youtube, so you can join in, even if you couldn't make the hangout.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OrGPHBQ4dGo" width="560" height="315" align="center"></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The focus on API definitions being the contract, was the most important part of today's hangout for me. This wasn't a conversation about just Swagger, or API Blueprint, it was a discussion about the role API definitions play in the API life cycle, from the latest wave of API description formats like Swagger and Blueprint, to API discovery formats like APIs.json, and even media types, and schemas. These are the contracts we are using to communicate our ideas, generate code, setup tests, drive documentation, and make the API economy go roudn.</p>
<p>This hangout was scheduled to be an hour, but there was so much to cover, we took it an extra 30 minutes. The conversation left me feeling like I need to do this more often, expanding on the API definition discussion, but also push into other important areas like API deployment, virtualization, discovery, monitoring, and the other almost 40 areas of the API lifecycle I track on. We'll see how much time i have to do these, but more importantly my ability to bring smart people like Steve and Jakub together--something I hope I can make it work.</p>
<p>Thanks to Jakub and Steve for participating today!</p>

        <span class="post-date">25 Jan 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-reverse-engineer.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="http://stack.apievangelist.com/companies.html">As I work to complete more API definitions, with all API endpoints defined as an OpenAPI Spec, API Blueprint, and Postman Collection, with everything wrapped in a complete APIs.json index</a>--I can't help but consider the importance of these definitions in helping others reverse engineer these APIs, to help apply in their own API design, development, and management processes.</p>
<p>Whether or not you are learning about an API for consumption purposes, or learning about it from a providers perspective, there is a lot to learn from APIs that are defined using&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification">OpenAPI Spec</a>, <a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>, and <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/docs/collections">Postman Collection</a>, and is something I'm working to push <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json to deliver on more</a>. Right now I'm struggling to just get the basics of each API, its individual methods, parameters, and underlying schemas. I am also working to index their overall operations using APIs.json. Soon though, I will reach the point where I will have a nice collection of existing APIs defined, I will be able to do much, much more--this is what I'm planning for now.</p>
<p>Now that I am closing in on having a couple hundred, complete (enough) API definitions for leading platforms, I think I will take another look through the stack, and evaluate how I can position them better to help potential API consumers, as well as API providers. API consumers are going to care about learning only what they need to get at the valuable resources made available via the API, while providers are going to want to better understand the API design, schemas, business models, and other aspects of the operations.</p>
<p>I'm thinking more deeply the API provider and API consumer sides of the same coin, so when you land on the home page of any API service provider, there is personalized, easy to use, visual elements that draw you in to learn more about an existing API you already know about. Want to learn how to connect to APIs using Postman, here is a Twitter guide. Want to learn more about designing a file storage API using Apiary, here is a Dropbox guide. There is no reason that these common guides could be easily available in the tooling we use everyday, and be driven by APIs.json, OpenAPI Spec, and API Blueprint.To help illustrate my point, I am going to pick 10 of the most well known APIs, and craft examples of what I am talking about. Blueprints that could be used in any service, as easily provide reverse engineering lessons from the home page, dashboards, and help sections we are using each day. I learn a lot about APIs from reverse engineering the API definitions of leading APIs, and hoping others will too.</p>
<p>If there is a specific API you'd like to see, let me know, and I'll consider prioritizing.</p>

        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-a.png" alt="" width="50" align="right" /></p>
<p>There are many inconsistencies I struggle with in the API space, and the lack of meaningful icons to express myself is one of them. I was meeting with my friend Jerome Louvel of <a href="http://restlet.com/">Restlet</a> this last week, and he also articulated (again), the lack of imagery that represents APIs. To understand what we are talking about simple icons, like what RSS has, but to represent an API, instead of an XML feed.</p>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/api-image.png" alt="" width="50" align="right" /></p>
<p>When I need an image to represent an API, I always borrow the simple icon from the <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>. Like my API Evangelist logo, it is a pretty simple, black and white, minimum viable representation of "API". The folks over at Restlet also have their own, image, that they use across the platform, and suggested it as one potential design that could be used. This is a concept that I would like to push forward. I think branding, and iconography is very important, and is something long overdue for the API space.</p>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/api-industry-icons.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>I would like to see a single universal, community driven icon to represent the concept of a web API. I would also like to see similar icons for formats used across the space, as well as vendor specific icons. If you look at <a href="http://stack.apievangelist.com/companies.html">my personal API stack</a>, as well as <a href="http://theapistack.com/companies.html">my overall stack</a>, you see me using a mix of format, and vendor icons to document a pretty complex assortment of API driven resources, and information. I'd like to step this up a bit, be able to standardize across not just my network of sites, but the overall API community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am guessing this is something I will have to slowly push forward, like the numerous other areas of my API industry research, but would love to hear your input, and see what else we could do to establish a common set of API industry icons. I'm already working with a handful of API vendors to define their <a href="http://embeddable.apievangelist.com">API driven embeddable strategy</a>, and looking to push forward <a href="http://branding.apievangelist.com">my API branding research</a>, so I wanted to make sure and publish a story on this--which in my world is essential to the ideation process, and essential to moving anything forward.</p>

<p>Join me, Steve Willmott(<a href="https://twitter.com/njyx">@njyx</a>) of <a href="http://apis.how/ake3nxbapm">3Scale</a>, and Jakub Nesetril(<a href="https://twitter.com/jakubnesetril">@jakubnesetril</a>) of <a href="http://apis.how/ohgw3uqjt0">Apiary</a>, for a hangout on API definitions this week. I wanted to explore&nbsp; doing more hangouts under the APIStrat, as well as API Evangelist brand(s)--for this one I wanted to bring together some experts to talk about the fast moving world of API definitions, as a <a href="http://hangoutwith.apievangelist.com/">Hangout with API Evangelist</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://hangouts.apistrat.com/">This Wednesday, January 27th, at 11:00 AM PST, the three of us will jump on a Google Hangout</a>, and you are welcome to join in the conversation. We will be doing the gathering as a Hangout on Air, so that you can ask questions if you want, joining in the live conversation, or you can wait until after we are done, I will make sure and publish the video to Youtube.</p>

<p>Its a pretty important time for API definitions with <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/05/the-swagger-spec-is-reborn-as-open-api-definition-format-oadf-after-being-put-into-open-api-initiative-oai/">the Swagger specification reborn as the OpenAPISpec</a>, and Apiary, the creator of API Blueprint and MSON, <a href="http://blog.apiary.io/2016/01/18/We-ve-got-Swagger/">also adopting OpenAPI Spec this last week, allowing you to design and mock your API in both formats</a>. 3Scale was an earlier adopter of Swagger, and <a href="http://www.3scale.net/tag/swagger/">has taken a leadership position in shepherding it to into the Linux Foundation, and is a member of the governance working group</a>.</p>
<p>I figured that it is a pretty good time to check-in with Steve and Jakub, on the current state of API definitions, and how they see them impacting their own platforms, as well as the overall API space. If you have any specific questions you'd like me to ask, or have any specific topics you'd like to see discussed, feel free to tweet at me. <a href="http://hangoutwith.apievangelist.com">I'll tweet out the link for the event, but all you need to do is visit hangoutwith.apievangelist.com, this Wednesday at 11:00 PST, and join in the conversation</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/lucybot/lucy-console">I am happy to be showcasing a new open source, OpenAPI Spec driven, interactive API documentation, from the LucyBot team</a>. The API definition driven documentation solution is one of the best implementations I've seen to date, and reflects the future of where API documentation should be going in my opinion. While the <a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui">Swagger UI</a> has significantly moved the API documentation conversation forward, it has never been the most attractive solution, pushing some API providers to use a more attractive, less interactive, open source solution from <a href="https://github.com/tripit/slate">Slate</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://lucybot.com/console_demo/">LucyBot API Console</a> is both! It is API definition driven, using the <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification">OpenAPI Spec</a> as its engine, but also <a href="https://github.com/lucybot/api-spec-converter">provides a conversion tool for RAML, WADL, or API Blueprint</a>. The LucyBot API Console is also very attractive, responsive, and flows much like Slate does, but goes much further by being an actual interactive API console, not just good looking, static docs. You can see Lucy Console in action <a href="https://any-api.com/">over at AnyAPI</a>, or as <a href="https://lucybot.com/console_demo/">a small set that demonstrates different CSS variations</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist/lucy-console">I have forked</a>, and started playing with the <a href="https://lucybot.com/console_demo/">LucyBot API Console</a> more--I encourage you to do the same. There are a number of features I'd like to see in there, like more embeddability, and templability of the UI, as well as some APIs.json support, and D3.js visualization integration--so I wil be getting more knowledgeable of the code base, and in tune with the road map. I know the LucyBot team is open sourcing the code to encourage contributions, and are looking for investment in dev and business resources to move the project forward--so get involved!</p>
<p>It is good to see the <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">API definition</a> driven <a href="http://documentation.apievangelist.com">API documentation</a> conversation moving forward in 2016!</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Jan 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-abstraction-2.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was on the road last week, so I didn't maintain my usual barrage of API analysis. As I go through my monitoring for the week, I'd say <a href="http://blog.apiary.io/2016/01/18/We-ve-got-Swagger/">the biggest news of the week was Apiary's support of the OpenAPI Spec</a>. I got a test drive of the support for the API definition format over the holidays, and was impressed with how smoothly Apiary integrated the <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification">OpenAPI Spec</a> into their <a href="http://apis.how/ohgw3uqjt0">API design, virtualization, and management platform</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another very interesting dimension of the Apiary release for me, was how they seamlessly integrated the new API definition into their road map. This wasn't a switch to the OpenAPI Spec from API Blueprint, it was about opening up, embracing, and abstracting away of multiple API definition formats across their platform operations. As an API service provider, it is just smart business to support as many possible API definition formats as you possibly can. The 2016 road map for Apiary acknowledges the value of using the OpenAPI Spec, but still reflects the strengths that <a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a> + <a href="https://github.com/apiaryio/mson">MSON</a> bring to the table.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/08/28/we-need-an-open-abstraction-layer-to-help-us-better-define-and-design-our-apis/">Last September, I walked around San Francisco with Jakub Nesetril (@jakubnesetril), the CEO of Apiary, talking about the need for an open abstraction layer to help us better define our API, across all stops of the API life cycle</a>. This wee's OpenAPI Spec support at Apiary is Jakub's vision playing out, making sure the process of defining your APIs across the design, virtualization, and management areas of your API life cycle is as robust, and agile as it possibly can be. For me, this makes this weeks news much more than about Apiary abstracting away the complexity of switching between leading API definitions, than it is about their support for the OpenAPI Spec.</p>
<p>I had beers with Emmanuel Paraskakis(<a href="https://twitter.com/manp">@manp</a>) and Jakub at the Toronado on Haight Street in San Francisco this week, and had another conversation with them about their abstraction layer, which helps them efficiently switch between using API Blueprint and OpenAPI Spec in Apiary. They expressed interest in exploring the open sourcing of this layer, to help others achieve similar abstraction in their own platforms. During our talk Jakub reiterated his earlier vision of an open abstraction layer, where each API definition provider(OpenAPI Spec, RAML, Postman, APIs.json, etc) can maintain theri own plugins, abstracting away this work for API service providers.</p>
<p>Consider the opportunities when any API service provider in the community, serving any stop along the API life cycle, can seamlessly integrate this abstraction layer into their platform. Where they can work with a single API definition layer, which navigates the differences between each individual API definition, and the owner of each definition has to step up and maintain the individual API definition side of the equation. If you are selling your services to API providers across the sector, you should support as many of the leading API definitions formats as you can, and what Apiary is cooking up, will make this reality much easier to achieve.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/">My API industry research is constantly moving forward, shifting, and being added to--much like the space itself</a>. As I work to update each of my research areas each week, my process involves adding any news I've curated, and changes to the companies who are doing things in the space, as well as add or remove any common building blocks I've identified. These building blocks are the common patterns I've identified by studying how API providers are operating, and what features API service providers are bringing to the table, for API providers to put to work.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/29/the-api-lifecycle-my-talk-from-defrag-and-apistrat/">This last fall, in preparation for my keynotes at Defrag and APIStrat, I pushed forward much of my research, flushing out more of the building blocks across 20+ of my research areas</a>. As I was preparing for another big push forward with my research, I wanted to stop and take a snapshot of just what I'd consider to be the essential building blocks across the most mature areas of my API monitoring research.</p>
<p>I track almost 1000 stops along the modern API life cycle, but this snapshot represents what I'd consider to be a master list that API providers, and service providers should be considering as they design, develop, manage, and execute on almost 20 other areas of a modern API lifecycle. This snapshot is meant to be a guide to what I'm seeing in the space, which can be used as a checklist, in your own API strategy. I do not recommend every company do every thing listed in this document, but they are elements that you should be considering, and hopefully have a better understanding of.</p>
<p>Like my other guides, this one is in beta. I'm adding a couple new areas to my research in January that will impact this work, and I will also be exposing links to other companies, services, and resources that support each building block. You can <a href="http://apis.how/3logs6w2yo">download via a PDF version</a>, or <a href="http://essential.apievangelist.com/">access via its own Github repository</a>. If you see any mistakes, you are welcome to correct them there, and submit a pull request, or simply <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist/essential-building-blocks/issues">submit an issue</a> to let me know, via the <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist/essential-building-blocks">Github repo</a>. I will roll any edits into the next edition.</p>
<p>While not as short as I'd hope it to be, <a href="http://essential.apievangelist.com/">I think the essential API building guide across these 20+ areas of my research provides an interesting snapshot of the space in 2016</a>. Stay tuned...more to come.</p>

<p>I just finished spending an hour talking with&nbsp;Brent Baker (<a href="https://twitter.com/norcaljhawk">@norcaljhawk</a>), head of product for <a href="https://www.dwolla.com/">Dwolla</a>, and Jordan Lampe (<a href="https://twitter.com/JsLampe">@JsLampe</a>), about the vision behind the developer experience for their <a href="https://developers.dwolla.com/">new developer portal</a>. I will be able to craft many stories from the notes I generated during our conversation, but there was one aspect of how they view consumers of their <a href="https://docsv2.dwolla.com/#transfers">ACH transfer API</a>, I wanted to quickly share.</p>
<p>This portion part of our conversation came up when they mentioned how they broke up their API users, as they were rethinking the overall developer experience. They put API consumers into four distinct categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>seeker</strong> - individual looking for a solution</li>
<li><strong>implementer</strong> - individual implementing solution</li>
<li><strong>maintainer</strong> - individual maintaining solution</li>
<li><strong>hacker</strong> - individual playing with their solution</li>
</ul>
<p>I think this is a great way to look at your API consumers. I've heard many different approaches to labeling your API consumer buckets, but I'd say this is the first time that I've heard it put so elegantly. A moment I couldn't help but ruin, by selfishly adding:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>analyst</strong> - individual looking to understand role solution plays in big picture</li>
</ul>
<p>You can't forget about us analyst types who will just talk about your APIs, and rarely actually do any "real work". ;-) Anyways, I just wanted to share this small part of our conversation. The Dwolla developer portal experience is rich with <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/">API management</a> examples, that other API providers should be looking to emulate. I will keep processing the notes from our conversation, and share any other nuggets I collected during my walk through the API journey the Dwolla team has crafted within their new&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.dwolla.com/">API portal</a>.</p>

<p>One of the benefits of doing an API, is so that you can take advantage of the potential for a community feedback loop, driven by internal groups, external partners, and even in some cases the pubic. Under <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/">my API management research, you can find a number of building blocks I recommend for helping power your feedback loop</a>, but sometimes I like to just showcase examples of this in the wild, to show how it all can work.</p>
<p>I was reading the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.practicefusion.com/blog/2016-product-vision/">Letter from our co-founder: 2016 Product vision</a>, from <a href="http://www.practicefusion.com">Electronic Health Record (EHR) provider Practice Fusion</a>, and I thought the heart of the blog post, represented a well functioning feedback loop. As Practice Fusion looked back over 2015, they noted the following activity:</p>
<ul>
<li>798&nbsp;<a href="http://knowledgebase.practicefusion.com/forums/276361-product-ideas">product ideas submitted</a>&nbsp;with over 3,000 comments.</li>
<li>64&nbsp;<a href="http://knowledgebase.practicefusion.com/forums/276361-product-ideas/status/1466105">community ideas already delivered</a>&nbsp;as product features.</li>
<li>45&nbsp;<a href="http://knowledgebase.practicefusion.com/forums/276361-product-ideas/status/1417611">new ideas currently being worked on</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Acknowledging that this feedback <em>"powers everything we do"</em>. They continue listing some of the major customer requests that were fulfilled in 2015, and close the letter with an "eye towards the future". It is a simple, but nice example of how a platform's community can drive the platform road map. Sure a lot of this comes from the SaaS side of the Practice Fusion operations, but it works in sync with the <a href="https://developer.practicefusion.com/">Practice Fusion developer community</a> as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lesson from this one, to include in my overall research, is to always have a way to collect feedback from the community, tag ideas for discussion as potential additions to the road map, and carefully track on which ideas get delivered, and which ones end up being included in the road map. This is something that is pretty easy to do with Github Issue Management, which I use for my own personal projects, to drive both my <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/roadmap/">road maps</a>, and resulting <a href="https://kin-lane.github.io/master/change-log/">change logs</a>.</p>
<p>This post also pushed me to begin tagging these types of stories, organizing them into a simple API playbook, full of API platform how-tos, like this product vision letter from co-founder of <a href="http://www.practicefusion.com/">Practice Fusion</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Jan 2016</span>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/tripit/slate"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/slate/slate-tripit.png" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I was just talking API documentation with&nbsp;Brent Baker (<a href="https://twitter.com/norcaljhawk">@norcaljhawk</a>), and Jordan Lampe (<a href="https://twitter.com/JsLampe">@JsLampe</a>) from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dwolla.com/">Dwolla</a>. As we were going through their API documentation, they mentioned how they were using <a href="https://github.com/tripit/slate">Slate</a> for the version 1.0 of their API documentation, but for this round they took what they felt were just the best parts of Slate, and were looking to craft a new experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interestingly <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/24/dwolla-using-slate-for-an-evolved-api-documentation-experience/">I had written about their use of Slate for API docs back in 2014</a>, so it makes sense for me to keep tracking on, but more importantly I think the move reflects the wider evolution of API documentation. If you aren't familiar with Slate, it is a very attractive way to document your APIs, that many API providers and consumers have latched on to. Slate, in contrast to the very utilitarian style of Swagger UI, has certain elements developer prefer--something I can see why, after looking at a lot of API docs.</p>
<p>Dwolla's evolution from their old static API docs to Slate, and then<a href="https://docsv2.dwolla.com/"> to their current version</a>&nbsp;highlighted two important aspects of the modern API documentation evolution for me. First, the feedback to the Dwolla team revealed that the three column format which Slate used for documentation, made the documentation seem like it was not part of the overall Dwolla experience--it was separate. Which is one unique thing Swagger UI did, is that allowed it to be embedded within any API portal, even though the look was not as attractive as Slate is.</p>
<p>As they evolve overall their portal experience, <a href="http://dwolla.org">Dwolla</a> was sure they wanted to keep the code sample viewer, which allows for inline viewing of raw, PHP, Ruby, Python, and JavaScript samples for each API. In rethinking their API docs, the Dwolla team wanted to decouple the three-pane experience, but keep the attractiveness, flowing navigation, and inline language sample experience that Slate delivered--keeping just the best parts of the increasingly ubiquitous API documentation format.</p>
<p>For me this highlights some of the elements, the latest wave of API documentation developers, like <a href="https://any-api.com/">Any API</a>, may want to consider as they help push forward the overall API documentation conversation. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/25/we-should-be-generating-slate-from-swagger-so-we-maintain-a-machine-readable-core/">Any API did what I wanted to see, and combined the interactive functionality of Swagger UI, and the clean UI / UX that Slate brought to the table</a>. I recommend to anyone crafting the next generation of API documentation solutions, consider the overall layout, making things more decoupled, responsive, and allowing of more embeddability of all, or even just portions of the API documentation--making the API documentation experience more portable, and re-mixable.</p>
<p>Even though I'm not seeing everything I would like to when it comes to the evolution of API documentation, I am optimistic about what I am seeing, and my conversation with the Dwolla team shows me there is a lot of positive momentum forward in how leading API providers are really thinking about what matters, when it comes to API documentation.</p>

<p>I got an email in my inbox, <a href="https://developers.elasticpath.com/labs-helix">about a new API modeling language from Elastic Path earlier today</a>. The product is called Helix, and is sold as being <em>"the first enterprise-class API modeling language designed specifically for REST Level 3"</em>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Elastic Path team is where I first learned about the concept of hypermedia, I believe back in 2011--honestly, I had heard the concept before, but never fully grasped what it was, and the potential until 2011 (I know I am slow). However it has been an awareness that has grown rapidly, the more I learn about hypermedia, study how people are practicing hypermedia, and even dabble in it myself with my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/05/11/applying-a-little-hypermedia-is-helping-me-tighten-down-my-api-design-and-tell-a-better-api-story/">curation</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/12/02/realizing-i-need-hypermedia-to-bring-my-api-lifecycle-vision-to-life/">building block APIs</a>.</p>
<p>Elastic Path is an expert in the area of hypermedia, so it makes sense they would step up with some hypermedia focused API tooling, and even a modeling language. No surprises here, but where I was a little surprised, was when I read the "Why Helix":</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Elastic Path built Helix because existing API modeling languages, such as RAML, Swagger, and API Blueprint, while good for describing standard APIs, are not well suited to designing hypermedia APIs. Elastic Path Cortex, our patented API technology, utilizes Helix definitions and a Helix-compatible implementation, allowing our partners and customers to extend existing APIs and quickly create new ones.</em></p>
<p><span>After reading, I wanted to explore the portion of their description that states, <em>"Elastic Path Cortex, our patented API technology, utilizes Helix definitions and a Helix-compatible implementation, allowing our partners and customers to extend existing APIs and quickly create new ones."</em>, but specifically the<em> "patented API technology"</em>. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=pts&amp;hl=en&amp;q=inassignee:%22Elastic+Path+Software,+Inc.%22">Something a quick Google Patent search discovers as defined five separate patents held by Elastic Path</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>Hmmmmmm.....</strong></p>
<p>I know you all think I'm some hippie dippie API dude, who doesn't get all this VC driven, business shit you are all calling startups, and innovation, and you are probably right. However, I'd argue that many of all you really do not get this Internet, or API thing either. This is a hard one for me, because I've worked with Elastic Path since way back in API Evangelist history, and I personally know and love their team. So its hard for me to call bullshit on this, but I have to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not all the way through the detail of the patents, but in my opinion, they should never have been approved. They go against everything that is the Internet, and why APIs work. The only thing I see unique in the patent titles, abstracts, and art, is the term "microkernel". Not sure exactly what that is, but the rest of it sounds like what we are all already doing with APIs to me--correct me if I am wrong?</p>
<p>Luckily patents are coming back onto my radar, thanks to my lovely partner in crime doing the research for her piece,&nbsp;<a href="http://hackeducation.com/2016/01/12/patents/">Ed-Tech Patents: Prior Art and Learning Theories</a>. Her work, and this release from Elastic Path is encouraging me to <a href="http://patents.apievangelist.com/">spend some fresh time going through my patent research</a>, and make sure that I am paying attention to this type of stuff in real-time. I started my dive last January, making it a perfect time to refresh my research in the area.</p>
<p>I swear, with the Oracle v Google, last years Swagger bullshittery, and now this, y'all are going to turn API into SOA, and then everyone is gonna be whining at me that I promised this API thing would work!! Luckily someone will come along with the next thing to sell you fuckers, make money, and y'all can fuck that up too. #IFuckingQuit!</p>

        <span class="post-date">12 Jan 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-trusted-apps-and-users.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was emailed by someone working in government, asking some pretty interesting questions around using an application showcase, to make trusted applications available to an ecosystem of partners. I'm not going to talk specifically about the agency, as I have not gotten approval to talk publicly, but I think the question is an interesting mix of several areas I am researching, that I wanted to explore a little further, in an anonymous fashion. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a a heavily edited, summarized version of what was asked, but it essentially went like this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>There are 400 apps that want to get data from an organization but only some portion of them meet or exceed the governance criteria to be deemed &ldquo;trustworthy&rdquo;. &nbsp;This usually involves certain legal commitments are followed and other privacy requirements are satisfied--these 400 apps that will be evaluated, and if they qualify, they will be put into the an application registry. Another aspect of it is that rather than each of the 400 apps having to go to each of the partners to get authorized and access the partners API that it would be more efficient to rely on the application registry to determine if they can expose their APIs to that apps request(s) as well.</em></p>
<p>Application showcases, that share approved applications with an ecosystem is common, but what I found interesting about this agencies question is that they want to also use the application approval process, as a sign of trust for other partners, when it comes to accessing their own API resources. As I said, this conversation spans three key areas of what I'm seeing occur modern API ecosystems:</p>
<ul>
<li>3rd Party Applications (ie. approval, showcase, case studies, etc.)</li>
<li>Partner Programs (i.e. certification, access tiers, etc.)</li>
<li>Service Composition (ie. plans, monetization, rate limiting, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">Modern approaches to API planning</a>, and well thought-out <a href="http://partners.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">API driven partner programs</a>, provide the approaches you need to approve partners (ie. companies), and the applications they build. Then your service composition, <a href="http://3scale.net">using API management infrastructure 3Scale</a>, is how you craft the partner tiers of access, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/12/15/easier-to-offer-ops-apis-to-your-devs-if-your-api-service-provider-has-apis/">provide the API infrastructure APIs to your partners</a> for knowing which applications, have which levels of access. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/12/03/what-is-api-service-composition/">I've written about service composition many times</a>, but my <a href="http://partners.apievangelist.com/">partner research is just getting going</a>, so I wanted to take a&nbsp;look at the API pioneers, as potential blueprints in these areas--let's start with Amazon's approach:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/">Amazon Certification</a></strong> (individuals)</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/">Amazon Partner Network</a></strong> (groups, software)</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see both the individual, and group level offer several layers of certification, depending on individual, as well as the software being sold (ie. government, hardware, AWS marketplace, SaaS, etc). &nbsp;For some more examples of partner programs, I am taking a look at&nbsp;<a href="http://certification.salesforce.com/">Salesforce with their certification program</a>, the <a href="http://cgi6.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?SolutionsDirectory">Ebay&rsquo;s Solutions Directory</a>, with&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/overview/general/official-partner-program">Twitter's official Partner Program</a>, over at <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/marketingpartners">Facebook with their Marketing Partners program</a>, and the <a href="http://developer.edmunds.com/certified-dev.html">Edmunds Certified Developer Network</a>, for a start.</p>
<p>I felt this conversation provided me an interesting look on certifying partners (companies, organizations, agencies, individuals), and the software integration(s) they produce (app showcase, directory, etc.), then using that as a trust driver for your API service composition for your own platform, but also extending that identity, trust, and authentication for your partners to use in their own API service composition.</p>
<p>The application showcase portion of this story is interesting, but I think the use of partner program certification, and extending this to your partners, so that they can use in their API service is unique. Something that is totally possible, i<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/10/27/which-api-service-providers-across-the-20-areas-i-track-on-have-apis/">f your API management, planning, and partner layers all have APIs</a>. You can then use your infrastructure APIs, provide facades for your partners to access users, applications, partner program details, and other aspects of API operations, in a seamless way using APIs. *mind blown*</p>

<p>API Evangelist has long been dedicated to helping the average business user understand all that is API. I saw early on in 2010, the potential of APIs, when used to empower the IT, or even shadow IT of the average business user. I think I've done well in this mission, except for one thing, the API Evangelist network is heavily focused on providing APIs, and much more lighter on topics and information around consuming APIs--something I will be working hard to shift over the next five years.</p>
<p>To help me tackle this, is my new partner <a href="http://cloud-elements.com/">Cloud Elements</a>. I do not partner with organizations, unless they help fuel my research, and Cloud Elements is helping me pushing forward several areas including <a href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com">API aggregation</a>, <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/">API reciprocity</a>, as well as <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/12/30/here-are-the-top-api-stacks-i-will-be-working-to-define-in-2016/">pushing me to profile 50 of the top business sectors</a>. While these areas of my research will have lots of information for API providers, many of the companies, services, and tooling I profile in these areas will be about empowering API consumers, and even more importantly--all types of API consumers, not just developers.</p>
<p>Services like IFTTT and Zapier, make APIs accessible to the average business user because they allow them to move things around in the cloud using APIs. API service providers like Cloud Elements are allowing the average user to not just move things around in a way that protects their interest, and the interest of platforms (aka reciprocity), but they also all for aggregation, automation, and orchestration, of critical business "life bits" like documents, contacts, and images. This is why I seek out partners like them, to work in concert to better understand the space, but also tell stories that help average business user solve their actual problems. #winwin</p>
<p>You will hear me talk a lot about what <a href="http://cloud-elements.com/">Cloud Elements</a> is doing in 2016. Partly because they give me money, yes, but also because they are giving me money to operate, and spend my time researching how APIs can be put to work by the average business, and telling more stories that focus on API consumption. <a href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a>, <a href="http://restlet.com/">Restlet</a>, and <a href="http://wso2.com">WSO2</a> have helped me push forward my API provider focused research, and I look forward to helping balance the API consumer side of the scales through my partnership with Cloud Elements.</p>

<p>I struggle a lot with how I separate out my research areas--there are a lot of reasons why I will break off, or group information in a certain way. Really it all comes down to some layer of separation in my head, or possibly what I perceive will be in my readers head. For example, I broke off <a href="http://hypermedia.apievangelist.com">hypermedia into its own research project</a>, but now I'm considering just weaving it into <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">my API design research</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons I conduct my research the way I do, is that it lets me spin out research, if I feel necessary, but I can easily combine projects, when I want as well. As I move API <a href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com">aggregation</a> and <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/">reciprocity</a> out of my "trends" category, and into my primary bucket of research, I'm consideration an addition of a 3rd area dedicated to just orchestration. Right now I'm considering aggregation staying focused on providing APIs that bring together multiple APIs into a single interface, and reciprocity is about moving things between two API driven services--I'm thinking orchestration will be more about the bigger picture that will involve automation, scheduling, events, jobs, logging, and much more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I enjoy my research being like my APIs, and keeping them the smallest possible units as possible. When they start getting too big, I can carve off a piece into its own area. I can also easily daisy chain them together, like API <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">design</a>, <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">definitions</a>, and <a href="http://hypermedia.apievangelist.com">hypermedia</a> are. Some companies I track on will only enable API reciprocity at the consumer level, like IFTTT, where others <a href="http://cloud-elements.com/">like Cloud Elements will live in aggregation, reciprocity, and orchestration</a>. I also think orchestration will always deal with business or industrial grade API usage, where my individual users can look to some of the lighter weight, more focused solutions, available in reciprocity.</p>
<p>Who knows? I might change my tune in the future, but for now I have enough curated stories, and companies who are focused on API orchestration to warrant the spinning off of its own research. Once added, I will link offf <a href="http://apievangelist.com">the home page of API Evangelist with the other 35+ research projects into how APIs are being put to work</a>. I'm hoping that like my research into API <a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com/">monitoring</a>, <a href="http://testing.apievangelist.com/">testing</a>, and <a href="http://performance.apievangelist.com">performance</a> has produced a critical Venn diagram for me, that API aggregation, reciprocity, and orchestration, will better help me understand see the overlap in these areas for both API provider, and consumer.</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Jan 2016</span>
        <p><a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-commons/api-commons-icon.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I feel pretty strongly that for the next wave of growth in the API sector, we need the majority of public APIs in use today, to have well crafted, as complete as possible, <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">API definitions in either OpenAPI Spec or API Blueprint</a>. Yes I know, we actually need all of these APIs to be crafted using hypermedia approaches, but until then we need them all to possess machine readable API definitions, making them discoverable, learnable, and consumable.</p>
<p>It is easy to get hung up on this being about <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com/">API discovery</a>, but API definitions are enabling almost every step along the <a href="http://apievangelist.com">35 areas of the API life cycle I am mapping out</a>. Historically API definitions have bee used for interactive API documentation, but more recently are additionally being used to light up other aspects of API integration, such as setting up your <a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com/">API monitoring</a>, loading into the <a href="http://client.apievangelist.com/">API client</a> of your choosing, or lighting up a mock server for use in development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition enabling services and tooling throughout the life cycle, well crafted, complete API definitions is driving <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">API design</a> literacy. Many API developers and architects learn by reverse engineering the APIs they know, and a well crafted <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/">OpenAPI Spec</a> or<a href="https://apiblueprint.org/"> API Blueprint</a> provides a detail blueprint for enabling this experience. API definitions make it easier to learn about good, and bad API design, in terms of the APIs you actually care about--equaling a much more open mind.</p>
<p>I've been working to define API definitions as part of my API Stack work, for over a year now. You can <a href="https://github.com/api-stack/api-stack">access all the APIs.json + OpenAPI Specs + API Blueprint + Postman collections under the /data folder for the project repository</a>. Additionally, this repo is one of the sources of <a href="http://apis.io/">APIs.io which is an APIs.json driven open source API search engine</a>, which provides an <a href="http://apis.io/apiDoc">API for you to register and search for API definitions</a>.</p>
<p>In 2015, <a href="https://github.com/APIs-guru/api-models">I saw another strong player emerge, that I'm big on supporting--APIs.guru</a>. The open source API definitions repository is looking to be the Wikipedia of API definitions, providing a single place we can find, robust, complete, API definitions in a variety of formats. They have done a lot of work to seed the repository with 196 APIs, possessing over 4000 endpoints, but they are looking to take things to the next level, and will need our help to this Wikipedia of APIs become a reality.</p>
<p>The API Stack, APIs.io, and APIs.guru all need you to help contribute, and refine the API definitions in their indexes.

        <span class="post-date">08 Jan 2016</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-open.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>Another story I wanted to tell from <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/01/07/i-loaded-that-csv-into-a-database-now-let-me-expose-an-api-so-i-can-get-some-help/">my work to expose an API yesterday, so I could get help with it</a>, was focused around the service composition that I used. I feel like this is a powerful story, that should be told, and retold among API evangelists, across conversations with folks who are new to the API space, and the concept of putting APIs to work in their daily business worlds.</p>
<p>The largest concern I hear from people who don't fully understand API, is the perceived loss of control, from putting things up on the open Internet. When you don't understand <a href="http://3scale.net">modern API management infrastructure</a>, and the nuance of API service composition, what an API does can seem pretty scary. The first lesson around me exposing of an API, from the <a href="https://twitter.com/APIStrat">@APIStrat</a> speaker database, was about soliciting help from <span>Nicolas Greni&eacute; (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/picsoung?lang=en">@picsoung</a><span>)</span>, and the second lesson is centered around how I used a combination of public / private endpoints to make this work.</p>
<p>The first two endpoints or methods I published from my speaker databases, were simple GETs:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://api.apistrat.com/speakers/">http://api.apistrat.com/speakers/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://api.apistrat.com/speakers/aO6zItrUhKEUexi7zNiUjOzzJ1230Rfno9P123DJRHNEuh4117/">http://api.apistrat.com/speakers/aO6zItrUhKEUexi7zNiUjOzzJ1230Rfno9P123DJRHNEuh4117/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>All 351 speakers in our database are already public, <a href="http://austin2015.apistrat.com/all-events/">on the schedules for each of the six @APIStrat events</a>, so there really is no reason why I would lock up the APIs to get this information--I am just returning JSON representations, in addition to the HTML I already do on the websites.</p>
<p>However, for the collaboration part with <a href="https://twitter.com/picsoung?lang=en">@picsoung</a> the POST, PUT, DELETE (aka Add, Update, Delete), I'm going to need to secure things a little more. <a href="http://3scale.net">Using my already in place, 3Scale API management infrastructure</a>, I have an access tier specifically for my partners like 3Scale, <a href="http://wso2.com">WSO2</a>, and @picsoung already has a set of API keys at this API plan level. I simply put the three endpoints / methods for POST, PUT, and DELETE for the URLs above, into my "partner" level, and they require an appID and appKey for each API call--secured.</p>
<p>This is a simple, yet powerful example of how APIs work, and specifically the level of control that API service composition gives you. I can easily make the speakers across our six conferences available in a machine readable format for use in other websites, and mobile applications. With the same API, I am also able to open up write capabilities to the partners who I trust, enabling them to help me evolve my speakers information. I am able to publicly share my resources via an API, making HTML and JSON versions of it available, while also opening up important collaboration which will move my work forward, in a safe, and secure way.</p>
<p>This is APIs in action, and how they actually give you more control over the digital resources that are fueling your daily operations.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Jan 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 5px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-evil.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>I see a lot of APIs, and honestly I'm not excited about all of them. Some are public. Some are private. I am feeling that I could put the APIs I see into 3 different buckets: valuable, some value, and no value. Obviously there is going to be much more nuance to it that that, but this post is about the APIs that generate no value.</p>
<p>First, let me clarify--I am speaking value to everyone involved. This is my own personal measurement. Examples of APIs that offer no value, are usually about the exploitation of developers and/or end-users, while giving the lion share of value to the platform. I put a lot of Internet of Things APIs into this bucket, and other leading APIs from companies like Snapchat or LinkedIn. I'd also put APIs like facial recognition technology, some machine learning APIs, and APIs that may seemingly offer a lot of value to everyone involved, because of the opportunities for abuse, any value that has generated is cancelled out.</p>
<p>I' not going to point fingers at the specific API that triggered this post. I will just say that after reviewing an API, the opportunity for abuse is pretty huge, by the platform, as well as with 3rd party developers. It reminded me that I need to work to provide more <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">ethical best practices as part of my API design research</a>, reminding API architects to step back early on in the process, and consider the big picture--asking themselves should we be doing building this API in the first place.</p>
<p>We have what it takes to do almost anything we want, but I don't think we ask ourselves: "should we be doing this" enough. We aren't look at the big picture, and considering privacy, security, surveillance, and what the overall potential for abuse might be. When I am considering the potential for API abuse, I ask myself "what would Keith Casey (<a href="https://twitter.com/CaseySoftware">@CaseySoftware</a>) be able to do?" Keith is a wicked smart friend of mine, with a unique view on the world, which, well....gives him some unique super powers for causing trouble. As I'm reviewing existing APIs, or crafting my own, I just think about what kind of trouble could Keith get into if I gave him this API.</p>
<p>I poke fun at my friend, but this post comes from a serious place, and I know he'd agree. If you are an API architect, try to consider the wider potential for abuse using yout API resources. There are many wicked smart developers out there who aren't as stand-up as Keith, and could really cause some serious damage with the resources made available via your APIs. Make sure you have modern API infrastructure, and processes in place, that will give you visibility into how everyone is putting your resources to work, and that it is alignment with your business goals.</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Jan 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 0px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-government-regulation-uncertainty.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I pulled the title for this post directly from <a href="http://dyn.com/blog/which-way-does-your-data-flow/">understanding the impact of cross-border routing of data during an era of emerging geographic restrictions</a>, from <a href="http://dyn.com/">Dyn</a>. I'm writing about this to add it to my list of numerous concerns for API providers, when it comes to internationalizing their APIs, for the global API economy--such as <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/10/24/successful-patterns-for-multilingual-apis-and-documentation/">establishing&nbsp;successful patterns for multi-lingual APIs and documentation</a>, or <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/01/05/your-api-access-replicated-into-multiple-regions-around-the-globe-for-additional-charge/">providing API access that is replicated into multiple regions around the globe</a>.</p>
<p>Dyn's perspective comes from a more regulatory level, which I think coming from a DNS provider is something that makes the story even more compelling. At any rate, I feel with the big data / surveillance culture that is thriving right now, regulatory concerns, when it comes to data and privacy will continue to be a natural response, and will increase, and continue to be more heavy handed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not a fan of regulation, I understand its purpose, but historically I have not been an advocate for. However there has to be a counterbalance to the bad big data behavior from tech companies, surveillance by tech companies and the government, and the increasing cyberbullshittery that is going on. I'd prefer this counter-balance be a human and people driven response, but I'm guessing it will end up being a wave of very emotional government regulatory responses, <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/eu/eg_main_018365.asp">like we seen with Safe Harbor</a>, and beyond.</p>
<p>Its my opinion that extensive logging, software defined networking, and APIs coupled with OAuth controls is how we are going to orchestrate our operations in this new, extremely volatile, land-mine ridden regulatory environment that is unfolding. This is why I keep an eye on global DNS infrastructure providers like Dyn, <a href="http://dns.apievangelist.com/">as part of my DNS research</a>, so that I can map out all of their API operations, and include alongside logging, SDN, and other relevant APIs--the automation of cross-border data flows using APIs, so that you can mitigate regulatory uncertainty.</p>
<p>I see the concept of "data flow" playing a significant role in helping use define our digital self, both individual and organizationally. Similar to <a href="http://stack.apievangelist.com/companies.html">bringing into focus what online services I depend on,</a> and having a better handle on where my valuable digital assetts are stored, I want to know where my data flows, and have some control over it as a business or as individual. I suspect this is something that more businesses, and god help us, hopefully more individuals begin asking for, and head off some of the regulatory headwinds that are in store for all of us.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-api-help.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I have been working to clean up the the web presence for the <a href="http://apistrat.com">API Strategy &amp; Practice conference</a>. We concluded the 6th edition of <a href="http://austin2015.apistrat.com/">@APIStrat in Austin this last november</a> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/apistrat">check out the videos</a>), and in addition to this events website, I have five other sites to maintain, and make sure remain accessible. The first three sites have a custom database back-end, the next two had a WordPress + MySQL back-end, and the last edition uses Jekyll + YAML as its back-end(?).&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of this round of housecleaning I aggregated the schedule of speakers from all six events into a single spreadsheet, which ended up on my desktop as a CSV file. As I was talking this morning with the rest of the @APIStrat team about the 2016 schedule, I shared the CSV in Slack, as I also uploaded to a MySQL database (yeah I'm new / old school like that). I was talking with my partner in crime Nicolas Greni&eacute; (<a href="https://twitter.com/picsoung?lang=en">@picsoung</a>) shortly after, and he wanted to help me push forward the list of speakers, expand the speaker and company info, as well as connect it up with sponsor info.</p>
<p>I then responded, as Steve Willmott (@njyx) points out on Twitter (is nothing private these days!!!):</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">APIer's at work <a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane">@kinlane</a> "I may take you up on that sir. loaded into DB. Let me expose an API on it I&rsquo;ll ping you for some help" <a href="https://twitter.com/picsoung">@picsoung</a></p>
&mdash; Steven Willmott (@njyx) <a href="https://twitter.com/njyx/status/685165771203461121">January 7, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
<p>I went ahead and exposed an API of all of the 351 speakers who have participated in @APIStrat since <a href="http://newyork2013.apistrat.com/">the first edition in New York in February 2013</a>--you can access the endpoints, publicly at:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://api.apistrat.com/speakers/">http://api.apistrat.com/speakers/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I also added the ability to pull a single speaker as well:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://api.apistrat.com/speakers/aO6zItrUhKEUexi7zNiUjOzzJ1230Rfno9P123DJRHNEuh4117/">http://api.apistrat.com/speakers/aO6zItrUhKEUexi7zNiUjOzzJ1230Rfno9P123DJRHNEuh4117/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>All you have to do is put in the speaker_id for each of the speakers. Now, anyone can pull the information on 351 of the speakers who have helped make @APIStrat a thing. Next I also want <a href="https://twitter.com/picsoung?lang=en">@picsoung</a>&nbsp;to be able to help me build upon the list of speakers. This is where APIs rock at making the web not just consumable, but also something anyone can program.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="ttp://apistrat.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://www.3scale.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/apistrat-logo.jpg" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Using the two paths provided above, I then added a POST, PUT, and DELETE for the @APIStrat speaker resource. I want <a href="https://twitter.com/picsoung?lang=en">@picsoung</a> to help me add, update, and delete from the speaker list. Now he can help me make sure all the information available is up to date. <a href="http://3scale.net">Since I have 3Scale API infrastructure in place</a>, and since <a href="https://twitter.com/picsoung?lang=en">@picsoung</a> is established as a "partner in crime", he has an API key which allows him to not just GET (which anyone can do), he can also POST, PUT, and DELETE--making my speakers resource programmable to only myself, and @picsoung, or anyone else who has "partner in crime" level access to the @APIStrat API.</p>
<p>I know my work isn't done, but I will hand-off to @picsoung for some feedback before I go any further. Steve's tweet reminded me of the potential for APIs to empower collaboration like this. I have a CSV list of speakers across six editions of @APIStrat, which I've uploaded to a database, and I need help improving. So...I published an API providing access to the list, but then using <a href="http://3scale.net">3Scale I am able to also add add, update, and delete capabilities, in a secure way</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uploading the CSV to the database, exposing a read / write API, and crafting an OpenAPI Spec for the API (below), is about all I have time for today. I will hand off to <a href="https://twitter.com/picsoung?lang=en">@picsoung</a> for feedback, and then I can spend some time thinking about whats next. We want to add more details on the companies the speakers work for, and the APIs that exist behind this diverse spectrum of speakers.</p>
<p>As APIs should be, the speakers API for @APIStrat is a work in progress. We are just going to be a little more transparent about the journey. BTW....if you want some "partner in crime" API access, let me know. ;-)</p>

<p>I came across the <a href="https://www.privacyrights.org">Privacy Rights Clearinghouse</a>, while conducting a search that turned up the chronology of data breaches, <a href="https://www.privacyrights.org/data-breach/new">which provides details on&nbsp;4,725 data breaches that have been made public since 2005</a>. The website allows you to search for data breaches by type of breach, type of organization, and the year in which it occurred--some very valuable information.</p>
<p>In 2016, as breaches continue to be common place across almost all industries, we are going to need to take the chronology of data breaches up a notch. I would like to see an API be made available for the valuable database. As I do, I write stories about what I'd like to see in the space, and forward the link to key actors, and tell the story to the public at large, in hopes of inciting something to happen.</p>
<p>Making the data breach information available via API, would encourage more storytelling around the events, which could include much more meaningful <a href="http://d3js.org/">visualizations using solutions like D3.js</a>. Information about companies, could be included into other business search and discovery tooling, and more push notification networks could be setup that could keep industry experts more informed about what is happening across the sector.</p>
<p>Now that I am on the subject, it would make sense if all the privacy topics, and other resources available via the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse accessible through a simple API interface. If you work with the&nbsp;Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, and would like to talk about making this happen, feel free to reach out. If you are someone who would like to help work on this project, or possibly fund this work, also please let me know.</p>
<p>The type of information the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.privacyrights.org">Privacy Rights Clearinghouse</a> is aggregating is only going to become more important in the insecure cyber world we have created, and making it accessible for reading and writing via a simple API, would significantly help the organization make a bigger impact, and educate a larger audiences.</p>

        <span class="post-date">05 Jan 2016</span>
        <p>I am finding all sorts of interesting examples as I push forward my <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">API plans research</a>, where I study the API planning approaches employed by over 50 of the leading APIs. One of the items, on my API plan story list, comes from <a href="https://www.algolia.com/">Algolia</a>, the search API, who I think has <a href="https://www.algolia.com/pricing">one of the more sophisticated API plans</a> of all of the APIs I looked at this round.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the cool aspects I found <a href="https://www.algolia.com/pricing">was a "world-wide replicator" option on the pricing page for Algolia</a>. The feature is interesting to me because of the UX / UI approach employed, as well as the concept of offering API replication to different regions as a dimension of API plans. You have to admit the separate section, as part of API pricing, is pretty forward leaning, and not something you see often.</p>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/algolia-world-wide-replication-slider.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>What is even cooler, is that when you move the slider, increasing the number of regions the API is available in, your price per package is adjusted to include the replication. I believe they apply just a flat rate increase for each plan level, but I could see this be something that has unique cost per region (ie. US being more expensive than EU). As the debate about in-country data storage and compute evolves, I think this will become pretty significant.</p>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/algolia-world-wide-replication-slider-2_png.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>The goal for the Algolia world-wide replication, is to decrease latency for end-users, when searches are made. Providing up to five separate regions around the globe, where your API can be deployed, as part of your Algolia API plan. While not something that could be accomplished by every API, the approach is in alignment with wholesale API movements I've talked about before.</p>
<p><a href="http://3scale.net">Using API infrastructure like 3Scale offers</a>, you could establish this type of variability in plan levels, that are tailored for containerized-enabled, world-wide replication similar to what Algolia offers. <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">I have added world-wide or regional replication as one of the API plan building blocks</a>, and will keep documenting other examples of this very technical, but potential business and politically driven aspect of the API plan line of the life cycle I am working to define.</p>

        <span class="post-date">05 Jan 2016</span>
        <p>As I look through the business models of leading API providers I am profiling, I'm increasingly seeing security as a selling point. When API providers break down their pricing into tiers, they are usually very good at breakdown down the elements of what goes into each plan--this is what I have been studying for last couple weeks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I come across security leveraged as part of API plans, it is rarely a part of the free or entry levels, and is something you usually see in the higher level paid plans, and enterprise tiers. Here is an example of this, <a href="https://www.box.com/pricing/">in a screen shot from the Box pricing page</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.box.com/pricing/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/box-plans-screenshot-1.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>These plans are part of the SaaS side of the Box operations, but Box are pretty unique in that they have separate pricing tiers for the SaaS side of their operations, and a related, but addition set of pricing for the API side of their platforms. However, Box's approach provide the best example of this in action, with add-ons beyond the plan based pricing, that were also very security focused.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.box.com/pricing/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/box-plans-screenshot-2.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>Box is a document platform that services the enterprise, which includes numerous, very heavily regulated industries. It makes sense that they are emphasizing security. My focus is that security is leveraged as specific feature of individual plans, with an emphasis on it being present in the upper tiers, and with add-ons.</p>
<p>This really isn't news. It makes sense that an emotionally charged element like security is used as a component of planning and pricing. I'm just looking to document security as a component of API planning for my research, educate other platforms about the potential for this type of use, but I am also looking to better understand how different companies, in different industries are wielding it (or not).</p>
<p>I predict that security will increasingly be used as a component like this in SaaS and API planning. In the current, very insecure online environment we all are living in, individuals and companies will pay a premium for real or perceived security. My goal is to better discovery when security is wielded like this, and try to better understand when it is a real component of API planning versus when its just used as an emotional way to convince people to upgrade to higher level plans.</p>

<p>I was profiling the Facebook API as part of <a href="http://stack.apievangelist.com/companies.html">my API Stack work</a>. While I only use a handful of the endpoints available to me via the Facebook API, as the API Evangelist, I feel like I should have an awareness of the popular social API. Additionally, the number of great stories I find dramatically increase with the number of API profiles that I complete.</p>
<p>One story I extracted from my Facebook API research is about providing a <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/v2.5/test-user">dedicated test user API</a>. Using the test user API you can add, manage and delete test users, which you can use throughout the developing and testing of your API integration. Facebook is user- centric, but it seems like the concept applies equally to any other valuable resource made available via APIs today.</p>
<p>I'd file this under <a href="http://virtualization.apievangelist.com">virtualization</a>, when it comes to organizing as part of my overall research. Providing virtualization options for API consumers is something that is only going to grow with the Internet of Things, and privacy concerns. API providers should be looking at how they virtualize entire APIs using modern approaches to containerization, so they can be used in dev, qa, and production environments, but they should also be looking at providing data and content virtualization solutions like Facebook does with a <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/v2.5/test-user">test user API</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://blogs.aws.amazon.com/cli/">Amazon has a new blog dedicated to just their Command Line Interface (CLI)</a>. I use AWS as anchor for many of my API stories, but I also acknowledge that many API providers will never be at the scale of AWS, but nonetheless I am drawn to the regular streams of lessons available via the cloud platform, if you look in the cracks.</p>
<p>The new AWS CLI blog is one of these. I do not think all API providers should run out and start a separate blog for their CLI, but the existence of a dedicated CLI blog at AWS shows the significance of CLI to the API world. If you are looking to court the enterprise, and many other developer groups, a CLI should be a very relevant tool in your toolbox. If a platform interface is not also available via a CLI, you might be missing an entire segment of the developer community.</p>
<p>Like with my <a href="http://ide.apievangelist.com/">IDE</a>, and <a href="http://sdk.apievangelist.com/">SDK</a> research, I may be firing up a separate area for CLI. I regularly curated CLI focused conversation, services, and tooling during my monitoring, making it a good candidate for isolation into its own research project. Part of the reason in isolating into its own research, is that the topic will get regular attention from me, and a single repo for storing my research, which means the chances my understanding around the topic will increase greatly.</p>

<p><a href="https://octopart.com">Octopart is a search engine for electronic parts</a>. They have been on my API monitoring radar for some time now, because they have a <a href="https://octopart.com/api/home">very well done API</a>. Octopart was one of the first API providers I wrote about, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/07/31/giving-excel-power-users-the-api-driven-resources-they-need/">who were making their data available via their API, available in spreadsheets for business users, via a plugin</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reasons I am writing about Octopart this time, is much more mundane. They are just doing it right, and I wish all product websites, had an API presence like Octopart does. As soon as you land on the home page of the site, where you can search for electronics products, all you have to do is scroll down, and you immediately see a link for the API. There is also a prominent set of links in the footer, labeled products, that focus on the API, as well as the Excel and Google spreadsheet connectors built on top of it.</p>
<p>Octopart has a well designed API, that clearly plays a significant role in their overall existence as an online electronic parts company. Every time I read one of their blog post, or end up in their developer area looking at something, I can't help but think about how ALL product companies should be following Octopart's lead. It all takes me back to the year 2000, where I was working hard to convince companies of the importance of having a website, as I now work to convince companies of the importance of having an API. #dejavu</p>

<p>It is a new year, and we have a lot of work to do when it comes to defining APIs in the new year. One of the results of 2015, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/05/the-swagger-spec-is-reborn-as-open-api-definition-format-oadf-after-being-put-into-open-api-initiative-oai/">was that the specification known as Swagger was spun off into the Linux Foundation, where for the remaining of the year we were simply calling it the Open API Definition Format (OADF)</a>--quite a mouthful.</p>
<p>In 2016, a name as been given to the specification--<a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification">OpenAPI Spec</a>. If you know me, you know how I feel on all of this, but in 2016, I am focusing on whats next, not what just happened, so I am just happy there is a name, not some intermediary WTF. Soooo, head over to the <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification">new Github repo home for OpenAPI Spec</a>, and get involved.</p>
<p>If you are planning on doing anything cool with the OpenAPI Spec, please reach out and let me know. Now that we have forward motion with the specification, and a name we can ALL use, I will be assembling a new toolbox dedicated to the spec, and all the cool things y'all are doing with it. As I look forward across the 2016 API horizon, I have no doubt that the OpenAPI Spec will be essential to the next wave of growth in the API sector.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Jan 2016</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/server-cloud/roadmap/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/microsoft-cloud-platform-roadmap.png" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>A road map for your API, is one of those essential building blocks that can go a long way in building trust with your API consumers. Sharing your plans, helps developers prepare for the future, and better plan for their own road maps, keeping everything potentially in sync.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From my vantage point, a simple, up to date, easily found road map is a building block that benefits both API provider and consumer. Road maps help provider organize their plans, and figure out how they are going to communicate it with the ecosystem, then setting the overall tone for how API consumers will engaging with a platform--both good and bad.</p>
<p>During my regular monitoring of the space, I saw that Microsoft released a pretty slick "<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/server-cloud/roadmap/">Cloud Platform Roadmap</a>", which is yet another sign for me on how Microsoft is stepping up their cloud (API) game. Their interactive road map allows you browse the roadmap by areas like cloud infrastructure or Internet of Things (IoT), and see features that are&nbsp;recently available, public preview, in development, cancelled, or have been archived.</p>
<p>Beyond the core functionality of the road map, <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/server-cloud/archive/2015/01/30/increasing-visibility-for-our-customers-announcing-the-cloud-platform-roadmap-site.aspx">I'm impressed that they published a blog post telling why they did it, acknowledging that it will bring visibility into platform operations</a>. Additionally there is a prominent button, providing an email address where you can send your suggestions for the road map, providing evidence of how a roadmap can contribute to the overall feedback loop for an API platform.</p>
<p>Overall, I like the simplicity of the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/server-cloud/roadmap/">Microsoft cloud platform road map</a>, and it is definitely a healthy building block I'd encourage other API providers to consider offering as well. I'm going to make sure Microsoft's roadmap is one of the examples I cite <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/">along the API management line</a>, as part of my overall API life cycle map.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/12/16/defining-api-monitoring-apis-so-i-can-map-to-each-stop-along-the-api-life-cycle/">Last week I was playing with&nbsp;defining API monitoring APIs so I can map to each stop along the API life cycle</a>. I took three of the API monitoring services I use (APIMetrics, API Science, and Runscope), and like I do for other areas along the API life cycle, and for common API stacks, I profiled their APIs using the OpenAPI Spec. This is standard operating procedure for any of my research areas, in that part of profiling each company's operations, I profile the API surface area in detail.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/">For each of my research projects</a>, I will include this listing of each API endpoint available as part of the work. As I was adding one for my API monitoring research, I had a thought--I wanted to reorganize the endpoints, across the three API monitoring service providers, and group them by tag. So I started playing with a new way to look at the APIs available in any given APIs.json driven collection.</p>

<p>If you mouse over each actual endpoint, it will tell you the host of the API it is for. I am just playing around. I have no idea what value this would present for anyone, except for just helping provide a new dimension for viewing the APIs involved. For me, this particular one helps me understand API resources across many providers, while also encouraging me to think more critically about how I tag the APIs I define using OpenAPI Spec.</p>
<p>You can <a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com/apisjson/bycollection.html">view the listing by provider</a>, as well as <a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com/apisjson/bytag.html">listing by tag</a>, for my <a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com">API monitoring research</a>. I will be adding these two views to all of my core research areas, and the API stacks I define as I have time, but I thought it would be interesting to add to my own API stack, which is probably the most defined of all of my stacks--here is <a href="http://stack.apievangelist.com/apisjson/bycollection.html">listing by provider</a>, and <a href="http://stack.apievangelist.com/apisjson/bytag.html">listing by tag</a>, for <a href="http://stack.apievangelist.com/companies.html">my API Evangelist stack</a>.</p>
<p>We'll see how this plays out as I roll out for more of my research. I am sure I will learn a lot along the way, by adding new APIs.json driven dimensions like these. I'd like to eventually have a whole toolbox of these types of views, and even some APIs.json and OpenAPI Spec driven visualizations.</p>

<p>As the number of API definitions increases out there, I'm coming across many duplicates of APIs I already have in my collection(s). In 2016, I will increasingly need to be able to execute a diff on two <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification">OpenAPI Spec</a> or <a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a> files, and get back a programmatic, as well as a visual reference, which allows me to quickly understand the differences between each spec in detail.</p>
<p>In support of this API definition diff tooling, I can also see the potential for some sort of merging tooling, that would allow me to easily say yes or no, and merge various elements of either API definitions. I recently got sucked into using Ancestry.com, and they provide a nice way to merge discovered documents into your family tree, accepting or rejecting what you want--I would like to see this exist for API definitions.</p>
<p>As with every other other of the almost 1000 building blocks available across my API research, each element of the API life cycle should be available as an API, as well as lightweight, open source, micro tool. An API definition diff and merge would make to very viable API services, and if someone doesn't get around to building, I will probably get to work on a version of it for my own needs. I have a growing queue of API definitions I need to merge with my master stack, and not all of it is as straightforward as "accept all".&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/01/04/api-definition-origin-validation-and-attribution/">adding attribution</a> to my <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">API definition research</a>, I'm adding diff and merge as building blocks. They'll provide a reminder for me (and anyone else), that attribution, diff, and merging at the API definition level is an important aspect of the API life cycle.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Jan 2016</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-attribution.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I have done a lot of work hand crafting, and often scrape crafting, <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification">machine readable OpenAPI Spec</a>, as part of the work on the <a href="http://theapistack.com/">API Stack</a>. Creating a usable API definition is a lot of work, making it is a pretty valuable commodity, in contrast to my strong opinion that they should be readily available for EVERY API today. While there is still a HUGE AMOUNT of work to be done, I feel like the ball is beginning to move forward, when it comes to the number of publicly available API definitions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the API economy to work at the scale we all have pictured in our head, the surface area of ALL APIs, and its supporting operations needs to be defined, and available to consumers and service providers. Every API should have an <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification">OpenAPI Spec</a>, <a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>, and <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/docs/collections">Postman Collection</a> available for consumers to put to work. As we close 2015, I'm happy to say that I am optimistic about the amount of work others across the space are putting into API definitions, like the folks over at <a href="https://github.com/APIs-guru">API Guru</a>--who are discovering, improving upon, and validating API definitions in a variety of formats, <a href="https://github.com/APIs-guru/api-models#existing-integrations">all available on Github</a>.</p>
<p>A lot of work goes into crafting these definitions, and it is good to see them investing in this area. Their valuable index of almost 200 API definitions is being used to power <a href="https://any-api.com/">Any API</a>, and is complete with&nbsp;<a href="https://any-api.com/">a JSON index for the API collection</a>. Keep an eye on it, as it is growing every day--I know that I will be closely watching every commit to the open API definition repository. As I look through their collection, there are many APIs I already have, but there are many others I would love to build upon the work done by API Guru--just as I encourage others to do with my <a href="http://theapistack.com/">API Stack work</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of this forces me to consider, as this new <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">API definition layer of the API economy</a> evolves, and we are all borrowing, reusing, and building upon the work of others, where does API design attribution come in? In a post Oracle v Google API copyright case world, where APIs are copyrightable, how do we start moving forward with a healthier vision of defining and sharing of API designs, challenging the dystopian future handed to us by Oracle and our the federal courts. API design attribution is how we do this, where we give credit the sources of valuable API definitions.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/APIs-guru/api-models"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/api-guru-banner.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/APIs-guru/api-models">While browsing the machine readable index for the APIs Guru collection</a>, I noticed that they had an x-origin collection avaiable for each API they define. Within this object, they describe the format, url, and version for the OpenAPI Spec file in the index is available, much like I do with <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json indexes of APIs</a>. I have provided references to "swagger-original", as part of some of my APIs.json indexes, but many of them were hand crafted so there was no source, with only the static documentation acting as the source.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The approach by API Guru got me expanding on my own thoughts on this, where I want to site the potential source for any API definition in my collections, However in this fast growing API definition driven world, I am also looking to potentially cite multiple sources for any one API definition I have in my collection(s). If an API definition has an authoratative source, I want to have the URL indexed. If an API definitions has been enhanced or augmented through the work of others, I want to have those URLs indexed. In short, I need to attribute multiple sources, not just the origin as APIs Guru does.</p>
<p>I may vacuum up 5-10 separate OpenAPI Specs for any given API I have, looking for any details that I do not have with any of my own API definitions--each of these sources, if they contribute, append, or augment X amount to my API definitions, they should be cited. I just don't think there should be one authoritative source for any API definitions, in a world where sometimes API consumers better describe the APIs they depend on, than the API owners do. I want to attribute one, or many sources for any API definition I craft.</p>
<p>This process doesn't stop with existing APIs, I should also be able to attribute the API designs of others. If I borrow from the design of Twilio and SendGrid API designs (which I should without legal concerns), for my own custom messaging APIs, I should be able to attribute them for my inspiration in my API definitions. API design will be much like music, in that we will be building on each others riffs and beats, and we should pay respect where it makes sense.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will play with a potential an object schema for my API attribution vision. Building on what APIs Guru is doing with their x-origin. First, I will turn it into a collection so I can reference multiple sources, then I will also go beyond just origin, and I'll call my object x-attribution, and add a property for determining what type of attribution it is. For now, I will add attribution as a building block for <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com">my API definitions research</a>, which will be something I will be rapidly expanding on into its own category, and maybe get to crafting an actual schema soon.</p>

<p>Z (<a href="https://twitter.com/zdne">@zdne</a>) over at Apiary <a href="http://blog.apiary.io/2015/12/17/API-Blueprint-Future/">published a pretty interesting blog post before christmas</a>&nbsp;which highlights two important elements of profiling APIs using popular API definition formats. Z is key to the vision behind <a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>, one of the top 3 <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">API definition formats</a>, that are fueling API design in 2016.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Giving The Body Some Love</strong><br />One common complaint I've seen on forums, issue threads, and other places API developers hang out, is that OpenAPI Spec does not allow for properly describing the request body payload. I definitely agree with this, but is something that doesn't often impact me, as the type of APIs I am currently deploying, rarely employ a very complex body payload. However I do know some APIs that I've documented, where if you can't properly define the body, the API appears to have no value whatsoever, when described using an&nbsp;OpenAPI Spec.</p>
<p>It was good to hear Z state that, <em>"In 2015, we have spent most of the year building only one feature--the description of body parameters. This feature is also know as the MSON syntax."</em></p>
<p><strong>Acknowledging Media Types</strong><br />The next significant area Apiary is addressing with API Blueprint and MSON, is when it comes to supporting multiple media types, and making sure they are properly described in the API definition--<a href="https://github.com/apiaryio/mson">MSON</a> FTW!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Z talks about how, <em>"MSON isn't another syntax for JSON. MSON is agnostic to serialization media types. With MSON, I can describe the data and defer the decision whether they will be send as JSON, XML or HAL over the wire."</em></p>
<p>I will be learning more&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/apiaryio/mson">MSON</a>&nbsp;in January, and reacquainting myself with API Blueprint, as I document my APIs stack(s), but also specifically two of my APIs that provide JSON, HTML, and Siren media types. Hopefully this will allow me to also document the growing number of hypermedia APIs available across the space.<em><br /></em></p>
<p>Media types, and body are two areas that OpenAPI Spec (aka Swagger) is deficient. Something that gives Apiary a pretty interesting head start when it comes to two pretty fundamental building blocks of the web, and therefore APIs. I was going to start using vendor extensions, to begin playing around with content-type negotiation in my OpenAPI Spec&nbsp;files, but I might just invest my energy into sharpening my API Blueprint skills, and definition repository instead.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2016/01/03/thinking-about-the-monetization-layer-for-public-data/">Thinking About The Monetization Layer For Public Data</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">03 Jan 2016</span>
        <p>This is my walk-through of the concepts involved with the monetization of public data using APIs. In this work I am not advocating that companies should be mindlessly profiting from publicly available data, my intent is to provide a framework for organizations to think through the process of generating revenue from commercial access to public data, acknowledging that it costs money to aggregate, serve up, and keep data up to date and usable for the greater public good--if public data is not accessible, accurate, and up to date it is of no use to anyone.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/07/a-better-understanding-of-government-apis-and-their-consumers-before-considering-charging-for-use/">I have long argued that companies and even government agencies should be able to charge for commercial access to public&nbsp;data</a> and be able to generate revenue to cover operational costs, and even produce much-needed funds that can be applied to the road map. My work in this has been referenced in existing projects,&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/08/24/setting-a-precedent-when-charging-for-high-volume-access-to-government-apis/">such as the Department of Interior and Forest Service looking to generate revenue from commercial access and usage of public data generated&nbsp;by&nbsp;the national parks systems</a>. In my opinion, this conversation around generating revenue from publicly available digital assets should be occurring right alongside the existing conversations that already are going on around publicly available physical assets.</p>
<p><strong>Building Upon The Monetization Strategies Of Leading Cloud Providers</strong><br />My thoughts around generating revenue from public open data is built upon monitoring the strategies of leading online platforms like Amazon Web Services, Google, and others. In 2001 a new approach to providing access to digital resources began to emerge from Internet companies like Amazon and Salesforce, and by 2016, it has become a common way for companies to do business online, providing metered, secure access to valuable corporate and end-users data, content, and other algorithmic resources. This research looks to combine these practices into a single guide that public data stewards can consider as they look to fund their important work.</p>
<p>Do not get me wrong, there are many practices of leading tech providers that I am not looking to replicate when it comes to providing access to public data, let alone generating revenue. Much of the illness in the tech space right now is due to the usage of APIs, it is due to a lack of creative approaches to monetizing digital assets like data and content, and terms of service that do not protect the interest of users. My vantage point is the result of six years studying the technology, business, and politics of the API sector, while also working actively on open data projects within city, state, and federal government--I'm looking to strike a balance between these two worlds.</p>
<p><strong>Using Common Government Services As A Target For Generating Much-Needed Revenue</strong><br />For this research, I am going to use a common example of public data, public services. I am focusing in this area specifically to help develop a strategy for&nbsp;<a href="https://openreferral.org/">Open Referral</a>&nbsp;but it is also a potential model that I can see working beyond just public services. I am looking to leverage&nbsp;<a href="https://apievangelist.com/2016/03/31/gathering-my-thoughts-about-open-referral-and-the-human-services-api/">my existing Open Referral work</a>&nbsp;to help push this concept forward, but at the same time, I am hoping it will also&nbsp;provide&nbsp;me with some public data examples that are familiar to all of my readers, giving me with some relevant ways to explain some potentially abstract concepts like APIs to the average folk we need to convince.</p>
<p>For the sake of this discussion things down and focus on three areas of public data, which could be put to work in any city across the country:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Organizations</strong>&nbsp;- The business listings and details for public and private sector agencies, businesses, organizations, and institutions.</li>
<li><strong>Locations</strong>&nbsp;- The details of specific locations which organizations are providing access to public services.</li>
<li><strong>Services</strong>&nbsp;- The listings and details of public services offered at the municipal, county, state, or federal levels of government.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://openreferral.org/">Open Referral is a common definition for describing public services organizations, locations, and services, allowing the government, organizations, institutions, and companies to share data in a common way,</a> which focuses on helping&nbsp;them better serve their&nbsp;constituents--this is what public data is all about, right? The trick is getting all players at the table to speak a common language, one that serves their constituents, and allows them to also make money.</p>
<p>While some open data people may snicker at me suggesting that revenue should be generated on top of open data describing public services, the reality is that this is already occurring--there are numerous companies in this space. The big difference is it is currently being done within silos, locked up in databases, and only accessible to those with the privileges and the technical expertise required. I am looking to bring the data, and the monetization out of the shadows, and expand on it in a transparent way that benefits everybody involved.</p>
<p><strong>Using APIs To Make Public Data More Accessible and Usable In A Collaborative Way</strong><br />Publicly available data plays a central role in driving websites, mobile applications, and system to system integrations, but&nbsp;simply&nbsp;making this data available for download only serves a small portion of these needs, and often does so in a very disconnected way, establishing data silos where data is duplicated, and the accuracy of data is often in question. Web APIs are increasingly being used to make data not just available for downloading, but also allow it to be updated, and deleted in a secure way, by trusted parties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For this example I am looking provide three separate API paths, which will give access to our public services data:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>http://example.com/organizations/ -&nbsp;</strong>Returns JSON or XML listing and details of organizations for use in other applications.</li>
<li><strong>http://example.com/locations/ -</strong>&nbsp;Returns JSON or XML listing and details of organizational locations&nbsp;for use in other applications.</li>
<li><strong>http://example.com/services/ -</strong>&nbsp;Returns JSON or XML listing and details of public services&nbsp;for use in other applications.</li>
</ul>
<p>A website provides HTML information for humans, and web APIs provides machine readable representations of the same data, making it open for use&nbsp;in a single website, but also potentially multiple websites, mobile applications, visualizations, and other important use cases. The mandate for public data should ensure it isn't available on a single website&nbsp;but is as many scenarios that empower end-users as is possible. This is what APIs excel at, but is also something that takes resources to do properly, making the case for generating revenue to properly fund the operations of APIs in the service of the public good.</p>
<p><strong>The Business of Public Data Using Modern Approaches to API Management</strong><br />One of the common misconceptions of public web APIs is that they are open to anyone with access to the Internet, with no restrictions. This might be the case for some APIs, but increasingly government agency, organizations, and institutions are making public data available securely using common API management practices defined by the Internet pioneers like Salesforce, Amazon, and Google over the last decade.</p>
<p>API management practices provide some important layers on top of public data resources, allowing for a greater understanding and control over how data is accessed and put to use. I want to provide an overview of how this works&nbsp;before I dive into the details of this approach by outlining some&nbsp;of the tenets of an API management layer:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Users</strong>&nbsp;- Requiring users to register, establishing a unique account for associated all API and public data activity.</li>
<li><strong>Applications</strong>&nbsp;- Requiring users to define the application (the web, mobile, visualization, etc.) and other viable information regarding their access to the public data.</li>
<li><strong>Keys</strong>&nbsp;- Issuing of unique API keys for each application, requiring their inclusion in all consumption of public data via the API.</li>
<li><strong>Service Composition&nbsp;</strong>- Placement of public data resource (organizations, locations, services) into tiers, defining which APIs different users have access to&nbsp;and the scope of that access.
<ul>
<li><strong>Resource Specific -&nbsp;</strong>Allowing access to specific data resources to a select audience.</li>
<li><strong>Read / Write&nbsp;</strong>- Restricting write access to select users and applications.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Data Specific -</strong>&nbsp;Limiting which data is returned, filtering based&nbsp;on&nbsp;who is requesting it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Rate Limits&nbsp;</strong>- All APIs are rate limited, allowing for different levels of access to public data resources, which can be defined in alignment with the costs associated with operations.</li>
<li><strong>Logging</strong>&nbsp;- Each API call is logged, with required user application keys, as well as details of the request and response associated with each API call.</li>
<li><strong>Analytics</strong>&nbsp;- The presence of a variety of visual layers that establish an awareness of who is accessing public data APIs, what they are accessing, and details on how and where it is being applied.</li>
</ul>
<p>These seven areas provide some very flexible variables which can be applied to the technical, business, and politics of providing access to public data using the Internet. Before you can access the organizations, locations, and service information via this example public services API you will need to be a registered user, with an approved application, possessing valid API keys. Each call to the API will contain these keys, identifying which tier of access an application is operating within, which API paths are available, the rate limits in existence, and logging of everything you consume and add so it can be included as part of any operational analytics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This layer enables more control over public data assets, while also ensuring data is available and accessible. When done thoughtfully, this can open up entirely new approaches to monetization of commercial usage by allowing for increased rate limits, performance, and service level agreements, which can be used to help fund the public data's mandate to be accessible by the public, researchers, and auditors.</p>
<p><strong>Providing The Required Level Of Control Over Public Data Access</strong><br />Understandably, there concerns when it comes to publishing data on the Internet. Unless you have experience working with modern approaches to delivering APIs it can be easy to focus on losing control over your data when publishing on the web--when in reality data stewards of public data can gain more control over their data when using APIs over just publishing for a complete download. There are some distinct ways that API providers are leveraging modern API management practices to evolve greater levels of control over who accesses data, and how it is put to use.</p>
<p>I wanted to highlight what can be brought to the table by employing APIs in service of public data, to help anyone make the argument for why providing machine readable data via APIs is just as important as having a website in 2016:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Awareness</strong>&nbsp;- Requiring all data to be accessed via APIs which required keys to be used for&nbsp;<span>ALL</span>&nbsp;applications, combined with a comprehensive logging strategy, brings a new level of awareness regarding which data is accessed, and how it is being used, or not used.</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong>&nbsp;- While API keys&nbsp;are primarily used for logging and analytics, it also ensures that all public data resources are secured, providing tiered levels of access to 3rd parties based upon trust, contributing value to the data, and overall platform involvement--allowing data to be securely made available on the open web.</li>
<li><strong>Quality Control -</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;APIs act as central gatekeeper regarding how data is updated, evolved, and deleted, allowing for a centralized, yet also potentially distributed, and collaborative approach to ensuring public data is accurate, possessing a high level of quality control.</li>
<li><strong>Terms of Service -&nbsp;</strong>All API usage is governed by the legal terms of service laid out as part of platform operations, requiring all users to respect and follow terms of service if they expect to maintain their public data API keys.</li>
<li><strong>Governance</strong>&nbsp;- Opening up the overall management of the availability, usability, integrity, and security of the public data which may include oversight from governing body or council, a defined set of procedures, and a plan to execute those procedures.</li>
<li><strong>Provenance</strong>&nbsp;- Enabling visibility into the origins, history, and oversight of public data, helping establish the chain of custody regarding shared use of valuable data across platform operations.</li>
<li><strong>Observability</strong>&nbsp;- Allowing for the observability of data resources, and its contributors and consumers using existing platform outputs and mechanisms, enabling high levels of awareness through the API management framework employed as part of platform operations, meeting service level agreements, and expected availability.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to discuss, and quantify this control layer of any public data being made available via&nbsp;APIs if we are going to talk about monetization. Having APIs is not enough to ensure platform success, and sometimes too strict of control can suffocate consumption and contribution, but a lack of some control elements can also have a similar effect, encouraging the type of consumption and contribution that might not benefit a platform's success. A balanced approach to control, with a sensible approach to management and&nbsp;monetization, has helped API pioneers like Amazon achieve new levels of innovation, and domination using APIs--some of this way of thinking can be applied to public data by other organizations.</p>
<p><strong>Enabling and Ensuring Access To Public Data For Everyone It Touches</strong><br />Providing access to data through a variety of channels for commercial and non-commercial purposes is what modern API management infrastructure is all about. Shortly after possessing a website became normal operating procedure for companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies, web APIs began to emerge to power networks of distributed websites, embeddable widgets, and then mobile applications for many different service providers. APIs can provide access to public data, while modern API management practices ensure that access is balanced and in alignment with platform objectives--resulting in the desired level of control discussed above.</p>
<p>There are a number of areas of access that can be opened up by employing APIs in the service of public data:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Internal</strong>&nbsp;- APIs can be used by all internal efforts, powering websites, mobile applications, and other systems. The awareness, logging, and other benefits can just as easily be applied to internal groups, helping understand how resources are used (or not used) across internal groups.</li>
<li><strong>Partner -&nbsp;</strong>After internal access to data resources, access levels can be crafted to support partner tiers of access, which might include access to special APIs, read and write capabilities, and relaxing of rate limits. These levels often include service level agreements, additional support options, as well as other benefits.</li>
<li><strong>Public</strong>&nbsp;- Data can be made publicly available using the web, while also maintaining the quality and security of the data, keep the access as frictionless as possible, while ensuring things stay up and running, and of expected quality and availability.</li>
<li><strong>Privacy -</strong>&nbsp;Even with publicly available data there is a lot to consider when it comes to the privacy of organizations, locations, and services involved, but also the logging, and tracking associated with platform operations.</li>
<li><strong>Transparency</strong>&nbsp;- One important characteristic of API platform is transparency in the API management layer, being public with the access tiers, resources available, and how a platform operates--without necessary transparency, consumers can become distrustful of the data.</li>
<li><strong>Licensing -&nbsp;</strong>Ideally all data and all schema in this scenario would be licensed as CC0, putting them into the public domain, but if there are license considerations, these requirements can be included along with each API response, as well as in platform documentation.</li>
<li><strong>Platform Meta API -</strong>&nbsp;APIs do not just provide access to the public data, they also provide access to the API management layer for the public data. Modern API management allows for API access to the platform in the several important ways:<br /> 
<ul>
<li><strong>Users</strong>&nbsp;- Providing API access to user's data and usage.</li>
<li><strong>Apps</strong>&nbsp;- Providing API access to applicaiton level data and usage.</li>
<li><strong>Tiers</strong>&nbsp;- Providing API access to platform tiers and details.</li>
<li><strong>Logs</strong>&nbsp;- Providing API access to the platform log files.</li>
<li><strong>Billing</strong>&nbsp;- Providing API access to the platform billing for access.</li>
<li><strong>Analytics</strong>&nbsp;- Providing API access to the analytics derived from logs, billing, and usage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Observability</strong>&nbsp;- An API management layer on top of public data makes data access observable, allowing platform operators, government agencies, and potentially 3rd party and independent auditors--observability will define both the control as well as access to vital public data resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>In a world that is increasingly defined by data, access to quality data is important&nbsp;and easy, secure access via the Internet is part of the DNA of public data in this world. API management provides a coherent way to define access to public data, adhering to the mandate that the data is accessible, while also striking a balance to ensure the quality, reliability, and completeness of the public data.</p>
<p>There has been a lot of promises made in the past about what open or public data can do by default&nbsp;when in reality opening up data is not a silver bullet for public services, and there is a lot more involved in successfully operating a sustained public data operation. APIs help ensure data resources are made available publicly, while also opening up some new revenue generation opportunities, helping ensure access is sustainable and continues to provide value--hopefully find a balance between public good and any sensible commercial aspirations that may exist.</p>
<p><strong>APIs Open Up Many Potential Applications That Support the Mission</strong><br />As doing business on the web became commonplace&nbsp;in the early 21st century, Amazon was realizing that they could enable the sales of their books and other products on the websites of their affiliate partners by using APIs. In 2016 there are many additional applications being developed on top of APIs, with delivering public data to multiple&nbsp;web sites being just the beginning.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Web</strong>&nbsp;- It is common for websites to pull from a database. Increasingly APIs are being used to drive not just a single website, but networks, and distributed websites that draw data and content from a variety of sources.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile</strong>&nbsp;- APIs are used to make data and content available across a variety of mobile applications, on different platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Embeddable</strong>&nbsp;- Delivering data to buttons, badges, bookmarklets, and widgets that can be embedded across a variety of websites, and applications.</li>
<li><strong>Conversational</strong>&nbsp;- Using data in conversational interfaces like for bots, messaging, and voice-enabled applications.</li>
<li><strong>Visualizations</strong>&nbsp;- Including data in visualizations, showing API consumption, and platform usage around public data.</li>
<li><strong>iPaaS / ETL -</strong>&nbsp;Enabling the migration of public data to and from other external 3rd party platforms using traditional ETL, or more modern iPaaS solutions powered via the API.</li>
<li><strong>Webhooks</strong>&nbsp;- Notifying external systems of relevant events (location or service update) by pushing to URLs via what is called a webhook.</li>
<li><strong>Spreadsheets -</strong>&nbsp;Publishing of data to Microsoft Excel or Google Spreadsheet using the public data APIs, as well as spreadsheet APIs.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just an overview of the number of ways in which a single, or multiple APIs can be used to deliver public data to many different endpoints, all in service of a single mission. When you consider this in support of public services, a bigger picture of how APIs and public data can be used to better serve the population--the first step always involved standardized, well-planned set of APIs being made available.</p>
<p><strong>The Monetization Requirements Around Public Data API Operations</strong><br />This is where we get to the&nbsp;portion of this discussion that is specifically about monetization of the operations around publishing and maintaining high-quality sources of public data. Before a sensible monetization strategy can be laid out, we need to be able to quantify what it costs to operate the platform&nbsp;and generate the expected value from everyone at the table.</p>
<p>What are the&nbsp;<span>hard costs that should be considered</span>&nbsp;when operating a public data platform and looking to establish some reasonable monetization objectives?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Acquisition</strong>&nbsp;- What one-time, and recurring costs are associated with acquiring data. This might include ongoing payouts to API contributors who are adding, updating, and validating data via the API.
<ul>
<li><strong>Discover&nbsp;</strong>- What was spent to discover data, and identify its use on the platform.</li>
<li><strong>Negotiate</strong>&nbsp;- What time to I have in actually getting access to something.</li>
<li><strong>Licensing&nbsp;</strong>- Are there licensing costs or fees involved in the acquisition&nbsp;of data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Development</strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;What one-time, and recurring costs are associated with platform development.
<ul>
<li><strong>Normalization</strong>&nbsp;- What does it take me to&nbsp;clean up, and normalize a&nbsp;data set, or across content. This is usually the&nbsp;busy janitorial work necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Validation</strong>&nbsp;- What is involved with validating that data is accurate correct, providing sources, and following up on references.</li>
<li><strong>Database</strong>&nbsp;- How much work is being put putting into setting up the database, maintaining, backing up, and delivering optimal levels of performance.</li>
<li><strong>Server</strong>&nbsp;- Defining the amount of work put into setting up, and configuring the server(s) to operate an API, including where it goes in the overall operations plan.</li>
<li><strong>Coding</strong>&nbsp;- How much work goes into actually coding an API. Ideally, open source frameworks are employed to reduce overhead, maintenance, and the resources needed to launch new endpoints.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Operational</strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;What one-time, and recurring costs are associated with platform development.
<ul>
<li><strong>Compute</strong>&nbsp;- What costs are associated with providing server&nbsp;compute&nbsp;capacity to process and deliver public data via APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Storage</strong>&nbsp;-What costs are associated with on the disk storage, for both the database and other images, video, and related objects.</li>
<li><strong>Network</strong>&nbsp;- How much bandwidth in / out is an API using to get the job done, as well as any other network overhead.</li>
<li><strong>Management</strong>&nbsp;- What percentage of API management resources is dedicated to the API. A flat percentage of API management overhead until usage history exists.</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring</strong>&nbsp;- What percentage of the API monitoring, testing, and performance service budget is dedicated to this API. How large is the&nbsp;surface area for monitoring?</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong>&nbsp;- What does it cost to secure a single API, as part of the larger overall operations? Does internal resource spend time, or is this a 3rd party service.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Understand The Value Being Generated By Public Data</strong><br />Now that we understand some of our hard costs, let's have an honest conversation about&nbsp;<span>what value is being generated</span>? First, public data has to offer value, or why are we doing all this hard work? Second, nobody is going to pay for anything if it doesn't offer any value. Let's stop for a moment and think about why we are doing all of this in the first place, and what value is worthy of carving off to drive&nbsp;monetization&nbsp;efforts.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Direct Value Generation -</strong>&nbsp;What direct value is being generated by the public data platform operations.
<ul>
<li><strong>Usage</strong>&nbsp;- How is usage wielded as part of value generation? Is value about the increased usage of a resource, or possible value generated by a minimum usage of a resource? Usage is an important dimension of determining how value is generated as part of API operations.</li>
<li><strong>Users</strong>&nbsp;- How is the value&nbsp;generated on a per user level?&nbsp;Are&nbsp;more users valuable? or&nbsp;possibly&nbsp;more targeted users? Teams, groups, and many other ways to determine how users impact positively or negatively the value generated from platform usage.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Relationships</strong>&nbsp;- How can relationships between users, or companies be applied to value generated? Will access to more relationships positively or negatively impact how value is generated for the platform and consumers?</li>
<li><strong>Data Acquisition&nbsp;</strong>- Is the acquisition of data part of the generation of value via the public data platform, encouraging the growth of data.</li>
<li><strong>Applications</strong>&nbsp;- Is value generated looked at on a per application basis? Does having multiple applications impact the value generate? Coming up with interesting ways to understand how applications impact platform value for everyone.</li>
<li><strong>Integrations</strong>&nbsp;- What external integrations are available? How can these be leveraged to enhance the value for consumers? Are some integrations part of base operations, where others are accessible at higher levels, or on a one-off basis.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Support</strong>&nbsp;- Is access to support something that impacts the value being generated? Does access to support resources introduce the optimal levels of value consumers are looking for? How is support wielded within overall platform&nbsp;monetization?</li>
<li>Service Level Agreements - Are we measuring the number of contracts signed, and partner agreements in place? And how we are delivering against those agreements?</li>
<li><strong>Revenue</strong>&nbsp;- What revenue opportunities for the ecosystem around an API and its operation, sharing in the money made from platform operations. Obviously, anything beyond operating costs should be applied to expansion of efforts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Indirect Value -&nbsp;</strong>What are some of the indirect value being generated by the public data platform operations.
<ul>
<li><strong>Marketing Vehicle</strong>&nbsp;- Having an API is cool these days, and some APIs are worth just having because of the PR value, and discussion.</li>
<li><strong>Traffic Generation</strong>&nbsp;- The API exists solely for distributing links to&nbsp;the web&nbsp;and mobile applications, driving traffic to specific properties - is this tracked as part of other analytics?</li>
<li><strong>Brand Awareness</strong>&nbsp;- Applying a brand strategy, and using the API to incentivize publishers to extend the reach of the brand and ultimately the platform - can we quantify this?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Analysis</strong>&nbsp;- How can analytics be leveraged as part of API value generation? Are analytics part of the base of operations, or are they an added value incentive for consumers, and platform operators.</li>
<li><strong>Competitiveness</strong>&nbsp;- Is the public data effort more agile, flexible, and competitive because it has an API and can deliver on new&nbsp;integrations, partnerships, and to new platforms easier, and more cost effectively?</li>
<li><strong>Public Service -</strong> Making data available for use on many different web, mobile, and other applications demonstrates a commitment to public service, and the good public data can do.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While there may be other hard costs associated, as well as areas of value being generated, this should provide a simple checklist that any open data provider can use as a starting blueprint. Additional costs can be included on in these existing&nbsp;areas&nbsp;or added on as new areas as deemed relevant--this is just about getting the monetization conversation going.</p>
<p>There are two main objectives in this exercise: 1) understanding the hard costs and value associated with operations 2) assembling into a coherent list so that we can explain to others as part of transparency efforts. When it comes to the business of public data, it is more than just generating revenue, it is about being upfront and honest about why we are doing this, and how it is done--mitigating the political risk involved with doing business with public resources out in the open.</p>
<p><strong>Putting Together A Working Plan Involving Public Data</strong><br />With an understanding of the hard costs of providing a public data platform&nbsp;and an awareness of the intended value to be generated via operations, we can now look at what details would be involved in a plan for executing this monetization strategy. API management practices are architected for metering, measuring, and limiting access to data, content, and algorithmic resources in service of a coherent, transparent public data monetization strategy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is a core framework of API management that can be applied to public data that can be used to drive monetization efforts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Access</strong>&nbsp;- What are the default access levels for public data access via the API.
<ul>
<li><strong>Self-Service -</strong>&nbsp;Public access to the platform via user registration, or 3rd party authentication like Twitter, Facebook, or Github.</li>
<li><strong>Approval</strong>&nbsp;- Access level(s) that require the&nbsp;approval of user or application before they are able to access platform resources.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Tiers -</strong>&nbsp;What are the multiple tiers of access&nbsp;to&nbsp;all data resources available via API.
<ul>
<li><strong>Public</strong>&nbsp;- Define the default public access for the platform, with a free, limited access tier that is obtainable via a self-service registration without approval.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Contributor&nbsp;</strong>- Providing a tier of access to contribute content, validate and management data on the platform.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Service Provider&nbsp;</strong>- Providing a tier of access for service providers involved with public data operations.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Internal</strong>&nbsp;- Access tier for internal groups, used by all websites, mobile applications, and system integrations.</li>
<li><strong>Partner</strong>&nbsp;- Tier(s) of access design for data, and other partners involved in the management&nbsp;of public data resources.</li>
<li><strong>Commercial</strong>&nbsp;- Access tier(s) for commercial usage of public data resources with higher levels of access for set fees.</li>
<li><strong>Non-Commercial</strong>&nbsp;- Access tier(s) for non-commercial usage of public data resources with specific access waving fees.</li>
<li><strong>Government</strong>&nbsp;- A set of API resources is available specifically for government access.</li>
<li><strong>Auditor</strong>&nbsp;- Access across APIs specifically designed for external 3rd party auditors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Elements</strong>&nbsp;- What are the core elements that make up the service composition for the monetization plan(s).
<ul>
<li><strong>Paths</strong>&nbsp;- Establishing plans based upon the availability and access to different API endpoints,&nbsp;<span>including platform meta API</span>.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Read / Write -&nbsp;</strong>Restricting read and write access to public data to specific tiers, limiting who writes data to only trusted applications.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Time Frames&nbsp;</strong>- What are the timeframes that&nbsp;impact&nbsp;the public data / API monetization plan(s) and consumption.
<ul>
<li><strong>Daily</strong>&nbsp;- What are the details for managing, guiding, and restricting plan entries each day.</li>
<li><strong>Weekly</strong>&nbsp;- What are the details for managing, guiding, and restricting plan entries in weekly timeframes.</li>
<li><strong>Monthly</strong>&nbsp;- What are the details for managing, guiding, and restricting plan entries on a monthly basis.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Metrics</strong>&nbsp;- What is being measured to quantify value generated, providing a framework to understand monetization possibilities.
<ul>
<li><strong>API Calls -&nbsp;</strong>Each call to the API is measured, providing the cornerstone of monetizing access and contribution to public data--remember not all calls will cost, some will add value with contributions.</li>
<li><strong>URL Clicks -</strong>&nbsp;Each click on a URL served up via the API drive data and content is measured, providing details on value delivered to internal and external websites--URL shortener required for this.</li>
<li><strong>Searches -&nbsp;</strong>All searches conducted via the API are measured, providing details on what users are looking for.</li>
<li><strong>Users -</strong>&nbsp;Measure user acquisitions and history to keep track of the value of each platform user.</li>
<li><strong>Applications -</strong>&nbsp;Measure the number of applications added, with details of activity to understand value generated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Limits</strong>&nbsp;- What are the limitations imposed across all tiers of access as part of the API monetization plan.
<ul>
<li><strong>API Calls -</strong>&nbsp;How many API calls any single application can make during a&nbsp;specific time frame.</li>
<li><strong>IP Address -</strong> Which IP addresses you can request data from, limiting the scope of serving data.</li>
<li><strong>Spend -&nbsp;</strong>How much any user can spend during a given time period, for each user or application.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Pricing</strong>&nbsp;- What prices are set for different aspects of the monetizing the platform.
<ul>
<li><strong>Tiers</strong>&nbsp;- What are the base prices established for each tier of API access.</li>
<li><strong>Unit</strong>&nbsp;- What are the default unit prices of per API call access for each tier.</li>
<li><strong>Support</strong>&nbsp;- What charges are in place for receiving support for platform applications.</li>
<li><strong>SLA</strong>&nbsp;- What costs are associated with delivering specific quality or levels of service and availability?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the moving parts of a public data monetization strategy. It allows any public data resources to be made available on the web, enabling self-service access to data 24/7. However, it does it in a way that requires accountability by ALL consumers, whether they are internal, partner, or the public at large. This API management scaffolding allows for the frictionless access to public data resources by the users and applications that are identified as worthwhile, and imposing limits, and fees for higher volume and commercial levels of access.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Speaking To A Wide Audience With This Public Data Monetization Research</strong><br />I purposely wrote this document to speak to as wide as possible audience as possible. In my experience working with public data across numerous different industries, there can be a wide variety of actors involved in the public data stewardship pipeline. My objective is to get more public data accessible via web APIs, and generating revenue to help fund this is one of my biggest concerns. I am not looking to incentivize people in making unwarranted profits on top of public data, this is already going on. My goal is open up the silos of public data out there right now, make them more accessible, while opening up the opportunity for delivering to a variety of applications, while also funding this important process.</p>
<p>I wanted to help anyone reading this to craft a coherent argument for generating much-needed revenue from public data, whether they are trying to convince a government agency, non-profit organization, institution, or a commercial company. Public data needs to be available in a machine-readable way for use in a variety of applications in 2016--something that takes resources and collaboration. APIs are not another vendor solution, they are the next step in the evolution of the web, where we don't just make data available for humans by publishing as HTML--we need the raw data available for use in many different applications.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My new partner in API crime <a href="http://cloud-elements.com/">Cloud Elements</a> is helping motivate me to spend more cycles in 2016 on defining specific stacks of APIs, as part of my ongoing API industry research. I am taking the approach I've honed over the last five years in <a href="http://apievangelist.com">my core research</a>, and continuing to push forward on specific areas of the API industry.</p>
<p>Cloud Elements calls their aggregated APIs -- Hubs, because they are working to aggregate them into actual usable APIs. My approach is meant to organize common API definitions, into specific groups. I do not go as far as aggregating APIs into a single API, and providing a platform, and tooling for you to actually work with the APIs.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://cloud-elements.com/hubs/">Cloud Elements currently has 11 business API hubs defined</a>, where I'm looking to push the space forward by defining 50 stacks:</p>

<p>I am not in the business of pushing the overall number of APIs forward in the API space--this number means nothing to me in 2016. I am looking to better define what the most valuable APIs are, in some of the most meaningful areas of the Internet. Some of the areas I chose because they are core to web and mobile application development, others because they are important areas to the overall economy and society, with others just because they are frick'n cool!</p>
<p>You can see my earlier work in this area, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/">present under the verticals section on the home page of API Evangelist</a>, with my early look at the <a href="http://payments.apievangelist.com/">payment API space</a>, and more recent <a href="http://email.apievangelist.com/">email</a>, <a href="http://sms.apievangelist.com/">SMS</a>, and <a href="http://mms.apievangelist.com/">MMS</a> research projects. I will step up the process, and apply it to these 50 research areas, establishing research projects, profiling the companies who are active, curated the news and tooling from across the space, while looking to get a handle on some of the common building blocks employed. As always my research will be openly available in near real time on each research project site, but there will be some resulting guides, and blueprints which I hold back to monetize--maybe partners like Cloud Elements, and others will help co-brand them, and make available for free.</p>
<p>I wanted to thank Cloud Elements for helping light this fire. We are still working out details of which areas they are interested in helping invest in, but their approach to hubs, and their general support of what I do via a sponsorship, has got this ball rolling. I have cleared my calendar, to ensure I have time to tackle this work in the first quarter of 2016. If there are other areas you'd like to see prioritized, let me know, I'm happy to bump up specific areas listed above, or add new items if they make sense.</p>

        <span class="post-date">30 Dec 2015</span>
        <p><a href="http://www.apiacademy.co/"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/company/logos/api-academy-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>When it comes to keeping an eye on what others are doing across the API space, and occasionally pushing forward a few crazy ideas, API Evangelist is your source. <a href="http://www.apiacademy.co/">However if you really want to learn about API design and architecture, that you can put to work at your company, organization, institution, and government agency--the API Academy is where you go</a>.</p>
<p>There is not another team API team that so focused on API literacy, with as much expertise, as the API Academy team. If you have been to any of the leading API events like <a href="http://apistrat.com">APIStrat</a>, <a href="http://www.apidays.io/">APIDays</a>, <a href="http://www.apicraft.org/">API Craft</a>, and <a href="http://restfest.net/">RESTFEst</a>, you've seen their team in action, and known what they are bringing to the table.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mike Amundsen (<a href="https://twitter.com/mamund">@mamund</a>) is making sure we are all on the correct path.</li>
<li>Ronnie Mitra (<a href="https://twitter.com/mitraman">@mitraman</a>) is pushing the concept of API design forward.</li>
<li>Matt McLarty (<a href="https://twitter.com/MattMcLartyBC">@MattMcLartyBC</a>) with the big enterprise API architecture picture.</li>
<li>Irakli Nadareishvili (<a href="https://twitter.com/inadarei">@inadarei</a>) is paying attention to the overall API vision.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have learned a great deal of what I know about API design and architecture from these individuals, during my tenure as the API Evangelist. When it comes to the business or politics of APIs I'm on solid ground, but when it comes to API design, and API architectural considerations at scale--I will always defer to the API Academy.</p>
<p>The team informed me, that they are looking for someone to join their team. Someone worthy. Which is no small task. I can barely count on two hands, the number of people who I would recommend for the position, sadly many are already happily working on existing projects. Good thing there are many folks I do not know as well across the space, who are API leaders--if you are one of these people, and thrive on teaching others about API design and architecture, I suggest you ping Matt McLarty over at the API Academy...they need your help!</p>
