<p>I was doing some more work on my list of potential female speakers from the API space. I have some slots to fill for @APIStrat, and I saw another API event was looking for suggestions when it came to speakers. A perfect time to invest some more cycles into finding female API talent. Twitter and Github is always where I go for discovery. I picked up where I left off working on this last time, turned on my search tools that use the Twitter and Github API, and got to work enriching the algorithm that drives my API talent search.</p>

<p>Next up on my task list was to <a href="https://api-evangelist-data.github.io/names/">deploy a name microservice,</a> that would help me filter Twitter and Github users by gender. I’m interested in API folks of all type, but for this round I need to be able to weight by female. <a href="http://names.mongabay.com/">I found a list of the top names from the United States which had them broken down by gender</a>. I copied and pasted into a Google Sheet, fired up a Github repository, and published the spreadsheet of data to Github as YAML–giving me a <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist-data/names/blob/master/_data/male.yaml">male.yaml</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist-data/names/blob/master/_data/female.yaml">female.yaml</a> listing of names. I will be be use these names in a variety of web and API applications, but I wanted to be able to help filter any search results by a female name for this project. I understand the limitations of this approach, but it is good enough for what I am looking to accomplish today.</p>

<p>Next, I use <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist-data/names/blob/master/_data/female.yaml">my new name microservice</a> as a filter for any Twitter or Github account I’m paying attention to as part of my API monitoring. Quickly giving me a list of accounts to look through as I am developing my list of women doing interesting things with APIs. Once I’m done I have a list of Twitter accounts, and Github accounts, I prepare them as a Google Sheet, then get ready to publish the YAML within a Github repository as my API women microservice. Then I pause. Should I be doing this? In this current online environment do I want to be building out lists of women, without their consent? Sure their Twitter and Github accounts are public, but should I be singling them out in an easy to access list? IDK.</p>

<p>I am doing this work for my @APIStrat conference, and I want to share the information easily with other conference folks. I also want to showcase women doing interesting things in the API space. However, I don’t want to help automate the targeting and harassment of these women. By publishing a machine readable list of their Twitter and Github accounts I’m doing the heavy lifting for any potential online troll. I’m going to simmer on this one for a week. Luckily I can easily publish the list as a private repository, and share with anyone who asks using Github, by just adding them as collaborator on the repository. This situation has reminded me that with each microservice that I publish I should be pausing and always asking myself if I should be doing this in the first place. What are the possibilities for abuse? Am I potentially making someone unsafe with the service I publishing?</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/08/15/where-to-begin-with-webhooks-for-the-human-services-data-api/">I was doing some webhooks research as part of my human services work</a> and I found myself studying the types of events used as part of webhook orchestration for <a href="https://developer.github.com/webhooks/">Github</a>, <a href="https://developer.box.com/reference#event-triggers">Box</a>, <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/api#event_types">Stripe</a>, and <a href="https://api.slack.com/events/api">Slack</a>. Each of the event type lists for each of these platforms tell a lot about what is possible with each API, and the webhooks that get triggered as part of these events show what is important to developers who are integrating with each of these APIs. These event type lists really help make sense of the API activity for each of these APIs, providing a nice list to follow when developing your integration strategy.</p>

<p>What I really like as I look through each of these webhook event lists is that they are usually in pretty plain language, describing events that matter, not just row updates with a timestamp. These events can be very broad, triggering a webhook when anything happens to a resource, or it could be granular and be all about a specific type of change, or anything in between. Each event type represents something API consumers want from an API, and would be normally polling the API for, but since there are webhook events, developers can get a push of data or a ping whenever an event occurs.</p>

<p>Another thing that the presence of webhooks, and a robust list of events represent for me is the maturity of a platform. Github, Box, Stripe, and Slack are all very mature and robust platforms. There are meaningful events defined, and the platform behaves as a two way street, accepting requests, but also making requests whenever a meaningful event occurs. I’m getting to a place where I feel like basic webhook infrastructure should be default for all API providers. The problem is I don’t think there are well enough defined models for API providers to follow when they are planning this part of their API operations. Something we will need to tackle as an industry pretty soon, helping make sure webhooks behave in consistent ways, and have a standard API interface for orchestrating with.</p>

        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/drone-recovery/diamond04.jpg" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I was in Colorado this last week at a CA internal gathering listening to my friend Erik Wilde talking about APIs. One concept he touched on was what he called API gardening, where different types of API providers approached the planting, cultivating, and maintenance of their gardens in a variety of different ways. I really like this concept, and will be working my way through the slide deck from his talk, and see what else I can learn from his work.</p>

<p>As he was talking I was thinking about a project I had just published to Github, which leverages the Google Sheets API, and the Github API to publish data as YAML, so I could publish as a simple set of static APIs. I’d consider this approach to be more about foraging and wildcrafting, then it is about tending to my API garden. My API garden just happens spread across a variety of services, often free and public space, in many different regions. I will pay for a service when it is needed, but I’d rather tend smaller, wilder, APIs, that grow in existing spaces–in the cracks.</p>

<p>I use free services, and build upon the APIs for the services I am already using. I publish calendars to Google Calendar, then pull data and public APIs using the Google APIs. I use the Flickr and Instagram APIs for storing, publishing, sharing, and integrating with my applications using their APIs. I pull data from the Twitter API, Reddit API, and store in Google Sheets. All of these calendar, image, messaging, and link data will ultimately get published to Github as YAML, which then is shared as XML, JSON, Atom, CSV via static APIs. I am always foraging for data using public services, then planting the seeds, and wildcrafting other APIs–in hopes something will eventually grow.</p>

<p>Right now Github is my primary jam, but since I’m just publishing static JSON, XML, YAML, and other media types, it can be hosted anywhere. Since it’s Github it can be integrated anywhere, directly via the static API paths I generate, or by actually cloning the underlying Github repository. I have a Jekyll instance that I can run on AWS EC2 instance or Docker container, and will be experimenting more with Dropbox, Google Drive, and other free, or low cost storage solutions that have a public component. I’m looking to have a whole toolbox of deployment options when it comes to publishing my data and content APIs across the landscape. Most of these are low use, long tail usage data and content I’m using across my storytelling, so I’m not worried about things being heavily manicured, just providing fruit in a sustained way for as low of a price as I possibly can.</p>

        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-deploy.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>Deploying an API is an interesting concept that I’ve noticed folks struggle with a little bit when I bring it up. My research into API deployment was born back in 2011 and 2012 when my readers would ask me  which API management provider would help them deploy an API. How you actually deploy an API varies pretty widely from company to company. Some rely on gateways to deploy and API from an existing backend system. Some hand-craft their own API using open source API frameworks like <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/partners/tyk-logo.png">Tyk</a> and deploy alongside your existing web real estate. Others rely on software as a services solutions like <a href="http://apis.how/5ytnitnakm">Restlet</a> and <a href="http://apis.how/bgdteovduo">Dreamfactory</a> to connect to a data or content source and deploy an API in the clouds.</p>

<p>Many folks I talk with simply see this as developing their APIs. I prefer to break out development into define, design, deploy, and then ultimately manage. In my experience, a properly defined and designed API can be deployed into a variety of environments. The resulting OpenAPI or other definition can be used to generate server side code necessary to deploy an API, or maybe used in a gateway solution like AWS API Gateway. For me, API deployment isn’t just about the deployment of code behind a single API, it includes the question about where we are deploying the code, acknowledging that there are many places available when it comes to deploying our API resources.</p>

<p>API deployment can be permanent, ephemeral, or maybe just a sandbox. API deployment can be in a Docker container, which by default deploys APIs for controlling the underlying compute for the API you deploying. Most importantly, API deployment should be a planned, well-honed event. APIs should be able to be redeployed, load-balanced, and taken down without friction. It can be easy to find one way of deploying APIs, maybe using similar practices surrounding web deployments, or dependent on one gateway or cloud service. Ideally, API deployment comes in many shapes and sizes, and is something that can occur anywhere in the clouds, on-premise, or on-device. Pushing our boundaries when it comes to which platforms we use, which programming languages we speak, and what API deployment means.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/08/18/http-status-codes-and-the-politics-of-apis/">HTTP Status Codes And The Politics Of APIs</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">18 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/runscope/runscope-200-ok.jpeg" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>The more I learn about the world of APIs, the more I understand how technology, business, and politics are all woven together into one often immovable monolith. Many things in the world of APIs seem purely like a technical thing, but in reality they are wrapped in, and wielded intentionally and unintentionally as part of larger business, and sometimes a personal agenda. An example of this can be found with the presence, or lack of presence with HTTP status codes, which the default status is usually 200 OK, 404 not found, or 500 internal error.</p>

<p>While these seem like very granular technical details of whether or not an HTML, XML, CSV, or JSON document is returned or not as part of a single web request, there usage often dictates what is happening behind the firewall, and often times more importantly, what is not happening. I find people’s awareness that HTTP status codes exist (or not) a significant sign of their view of the wider web world. If they are aware they exist they most likely have some experience engaging with other experienced partners using the web. If they don’t, they most likely live a pretty isolated existence–even if they do have a web presence.</p>

<p>Beyond just knowing that HTTP status codes exist, understanding the importance of, and the nuance surrounding each individual one demonstrates you are used to engaging with external actors at scale, leveraging web technology. I have to put out there that I DO NOT have an intimate knowledge of all HTTP status codes, because I have not exercised them as part of large scale projects, but it is something I do grasp the scope and importance of from the projects I have worked on. This is not a boolean thing, you knowing HTTP status codes or not. This is the result of many journeys, with many partners, across many different types of digital resources. You can tell how many journeys someone has been on, based on how they view, and wield HTTP status codes.</p>

<p>I encounter folks in my journeys who are dismissive of my focus on HTTP status codes, but I find most of these folks to be purposely vague in the signals they regularly send, and are used to keeping things complex, inconsistent, or just never very well defined so that they can keep things suiting their changing desire and needs. This is something that works well internally, and within a small group of trusted partners, but it rarely is conducive to doing business at scale on the web. Some companies thrive in chaos, because they have the upper hand. They have defined the chaos, and benefit from being in the know of how the chaos works, and invest heavily in keeping a gap between themselves, and those who are not in the know. Forcing external entities to always be on their toes when it comes to understanding what is going on, unable to truly ever know if things are indeed 200 OK, or most likely just a 500 internal server error.</p>

<p>In this situation I always think of my friend Darrel Miller (<a href="https://twitter.com/darrel_miller">@darrel_miller</a>) who as an API architect can recite every single HTTP status code, and a usage scenario because of his vast knowledge of APIs and web standards. However, a side effect of this reality is that if you ask Darrel almost any question, you will get a real honest, direct, and usually very precise answer. Some folks might look at this as Darrel not having filters, or often possessing too many opinions, but I’m a big fan of his approach. With Darrel, you rarely ever unclear about his motivations, feelings, and experience with any topic. I find this world much easier to navigate than the vague, unclear, often purposely obfuscated responses I get from some companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies I work with. When doing business at scale on the web it always helps to provide clear signals that have a shared meaning, and being precise and upfront with what is going on behind the scenes, not hiding behind the black, white, and grey nature of just 200, 404, and 500.</p>

<p>I stumbled across <a href="https://pairbulkdata.uspto.gov/">the Patent Application Information Retrieval Bulk Data API</a> from the US Patent Office the other day. It provides a much more usable approach to getting at patent information than what I am using at the moment. Right now I am downloading XML files and searching for the occurrence of a handful of keywords. If I want to make a change I have to fire up a new AWS instance, change the code, and reprocess the downloaded files. The Patent Application Information Retrieval Bulk Data API gives me a much more efficient interface to work with.</p>

<p>The Patent Application Information Retrieval Bulk Data API contains the bibliographic, published document and patent term extension data tabs in Public PAIR from 1981 to present, with some additional data dating back to 1931. It has leveraged COTS semantics, maintains an open architecture, and the query syntax follows the standard Apache Solr search syntax, with API responses following the Solr formats. Providing for a much more powerful interface for querying patent data, which goes back further back in time then what I’ve been doing currently. I’m really interested in doing an API patent search for the 1990s, or maybe even earlier.</p>

<p>The Patent Application Information Retrieval Bulk Data API is a well designed API, <a href="https://pairbulkdata.uspto.gov/swagger/index.html">with an attractive API portal and documentation</a>, driven with an OpenAPI. The USPTO provide access to the patent data in the way that I think all government agencies should be doing it. You can use the API, or get at a JSON or XML download of the data. The API is “part of the US Patent and Trademark Office’s (USPTO) commitment to fostering a culture of open government as described by the 2013 Executive Order to make open and machine-readable data the new default for government information.” Which is pretty cool in my book, something we desperately are needing to become a reality across all federal agencies in 2017.</p>

<p>It isn’t often that I make up acronyms, terms, or phrases. <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2013/02/27/merging-api-automation-and-interoperability-into-api-reciprocity/">For a number of years I pushed forward the concept of API reciprocity</a>, but eventually conceded to the notion of integration platform as a service (iPaaS). Even with this failure I’m playing around with the evolution a new concept around how we map out our entire API operations, an area we commonly call the API lifecycle, but I’m exploring with calling it API transit.</p>

<p>When I think about the API lifecycle I am regularly reminded that it is something that is rarely a linear thing from define to deprecation, or even something that goes round and round in a circular format as the name lifecycle implies. This always brings me back to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/01/my-turkey-holiday-project-a-subway-map-api/">my API subway map work</a>, with the development of <a href="http://subway.map.apievangelist.com/">my subway map API</a>, and <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/11/29/the-api-lifecycle-my-talk-from-defrag-and-apistrat/">the keynote I gave on the subject at APIStrat in Austin</a>. The subway map concept provides a pretty comprehensive way to map out the unlimited directions in which an API operations might take, and I’m looking to see if it can handle both the provider side needs, as well as that of the API consumer.</p>

<p>While I like the subway map analogy, I really like the more general concept of API transit. The concept of an APi subway map seems one dimensional, where API transit seems like it could handle multiple dimensions. I’m not sure there is a fit here, but I wanted to explore the definition of transit, as well as use the phrase in some API storytelling to test out a little bit, and see if it even is coherent. Ok, so what do my friends over at <a href="https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com/documentation">the Oxford Dictionaries API</a> have to say on the subject?</p>

<p>etymologies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>late Middle English (denoting passage from one place to another): from Latin transitus, from transire ‘go across’</li>
</ul>

<p>definitions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the carrying of people or things from one place to another</li>
  <li>the conveyance of passengers on public transport.</li>
  <li>the action of passing through or across a place</li>
</ul>

<p>I like the idea that API transit could be about the process of carrying people (users data) or things (anything digital) from one place to another – with an API transmit map helping visualize this. I like that the map can be used by API providers as a guide for all the stops along the API lifecycle, but instead of being linear or circular, it can be all the above. Each API transit line could visualize an API lifecycle, and help API providers deliver consistently along each layer of API operations. The same maps, and lines can also be used to help API consumers navigate all API resources available via any API transit district.</p>

<p>“Denoting passage from one place to another” could be applied to training API providers about what is now called the API lifecycle, but could also be a series of journeys along pre-specified API transit lines, teaching them about concepts around API design, deployment, management, testing, and other aspects of API operations. These same lines can be used to guide each stop along the API lifecycle, helping act as an assembly line for delivering, maintaining, and even deprecating APIs. Once APIs make it to production, the same API transit map can be used to help engage with API consumers, helping move the people and their things from one place to another.</p>

<p>I’m not 100% sold on the concept, and it is something I’m not sure I will keep using. I do want to invest more time into my API subway map, which I’m going to rebrand as API transit map for the next wave of development. I have the API working, I just need to get the routing to work properly, so that it will lay down each of my API transit lines in a coherent way, allowing them to overlap, and work with and around each other. I have a model in my head for how I can use to help teach folks about key concepts of API operations from definition to deprecation. I also have a model for how it can guide the delivery and management of APIs, acting as a map and framework for managing API operations. I just don’t have the API consumer portion of the equation. I’m guessing it will take me another couple years before this comes into focus for me, but I still enjoy working on the concept, and pushing it forward a little bit each year.</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://goodapi.co/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/good-api/good-api-agency.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/08/16/the-importance-of-api-stories/">Earlier this week at the CA API Academy virtual gathering I spoke at in Boulder CO</a>, the question around why there aren’t more API focused agencies came up. We were talking about the need for consulting services around common areas of API operations like design, deployment, management, testing, as well as training around API lifecycle related topics. We are seeing some movement in the area of API focused agencies, but not enough to cover the current demand.</p>

<p>We are seeing full service shops like <a href="http://apivista.com/about/">APIvista</a>, and <a href="https://goodapi.co/">Good API</a> emerge. There is also movement on the agency level when it comes to integration platform as a service (iPaaS), over at <a href="https://lefthookdigital.com/">Left Hook Digital</a>, helping companies leverage Zapier, and integrate with API platforms. There is definitely significant movement in the number of API focused agencies, but we are going to need more to meet the demand for API design, deployment, management, testing, and other stops along the API lifecycle.</p>

<p>I’m guessing it will take a couple years for this side of the API business to mature. Then I’m figuring we will begin see to see more specialized API agencies emerge, helping with evangelism, support, API design, and maybe even industry focused iPaaS, similar to what we are seeing with LeftHook. As mainstream companies are waking up to the potential of APIs, they are going to need a lot of professional help to ensure they are successful in their API journey. We are going to need a number of general service, specialized, regional, and industry specific API agencies to help get us through the next couple of years.</p>

<p>I am focusing on trying to scale the API training portion of this need. I am ramping up development of API training courses that span my API lifecycle and API stack research. Helping API providers and consumers navigate the world of APIs. I’m talking with partners about working together to develop and distribute API training, and will be working to train some trainers at SMB, SME, and the enterprise. Eventually I’m guessing we will also be needing some API focused training agencies to help carry the load in being the last mile of delivery the API curriculum we will be developing.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Aug 2017</span>
        <p>I am preparing a talk for tomorrow, and I needed a new list of each stop along the API lifecycle, and since each of my project exist as Github repositories, and are defined as a YAML and JSON data store, I can simply define a new liquid template for generating a new HTML listing of all the stops along the API lifecycle–after generating this list I figured I’d share here as a story.</p>

<p>Here are the 85 stops along the API lifecycle landscape from my vantage point as the API Evangelist:</p>

<p>I’m always presenting <a href="http://apievangelist.com/api-lifecycle/">my API lifecycle research</a> as a listing, or in a linear fashion. I always feel like I should be creating an actual lifecycle visualization, but then I always end up feeling like I should just invest in my subway API map work, and create more robust way to represent how the API lifecycle truly looks.</p>

<p>Anyways, these 85 areas represent the scope of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/api-lifecycle/">my API industry research</a>, and provide a framework for thinking about not just the individual API lifecycle, but also the bigger picture of our API operations and partnerships. Not all of these areas apply to every API provider, but they do provide one perspective of the API landscape that all API providers can learn from. If there are any other stops along the lifecycle you think should be represented, I’d love to hear your thoughts. For example, I’m looking at adding two new areas: 1) training, and 2) fake. Helping me track on how API providers are training internally, with partners, and 3rd party developers, as well as think about the world of API driven fake news, products, advertising, users, and other illnesses emerging across the landscape.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><a href="http://webhooks.apievangelist.com"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-asterisk.png" align="right" width="30%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p>I have been studying the approach of a variety of webhook implementations in preparation for an API consulting project I’m working on. Even though I’m very familiar with how webhooks works, and confident in my ability to design and develop a solution, I’m ALWAYS looking to understand what leading API providers are up to, and how I can improve my knowledge and awareness.</p>

<p>With his round of research, Github has provided me with several webhook nuggets for my API storytelling notebook. One of their web features I though was the notion of a wildcard webhook event:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://developer.github.com/webhooks/">Wildcard Event</a> - We also support a wildcard (*) that will match all supported events. When you add the wildcard event, we’ll replace any existing events you have configured with the wildcard event and send you payloads for all supported events. You’ll also automatically get any new events we might add in the future.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have been working to identify a set of objects and associated webhook events, and the notion of a wildcard event is interesting. It seems like you could apply this globally, or to specific objects / resources, allowing you to get pushes for any events that occur. I’m not sure I’ll have time to apply this feature in my current project, but it is worth adding to my webhook toolbox for future projects.</p>

<p>There are three other features I’ve extracted from Github’s approach to webhooks that I’ve added to my API storytelling notebook, to hopefully craft into future blog posts. I’ll be adding these all as potential webhook building blocks that API providers can consider. I’m hoping to find some more time and money to invest into <a href="http://webhooks.apievangelist.com">my webhook research</a> this fall, and be able to publish a formal guide for the world of webhooks. I’m always surprised by the lack of formal guidance when it comes to webhooks, and is something I’d like to see change in the near future.</p>

<p>I am an API storyteller before am an API architect, designer, or evangelist. My number one job is to tell stories about the API space. I make sure there is always (almost) 3-5 stories a day published to API Evangelist about what I’m seeing as I conduct my research on the sector, and thoughts I’m having while consulting and working on API projects. I’ve been telling stories like this for seven years, which has proven to me how much stories matter in the world of technology, and the worlds that it is impacting–which is pretty much everything right now.</p>

<p>Occasionally I get folks who like to criticize what I do, making sure I know that stories don’t matter. That nobody in the enterprise or startups care about stories. Results are what matter. Ohhhhh reeeaaaly. ;-) I hate to tell you, it is all stories. VC investment in startups is all about the story. The markets all operate on stories. Twitter. Facebook. LinkedIn. Medium. TechCrunch. It is all stories. The stories we tell ourselves. The stories we tell each other. The stories we believe. The stories we refuse to believe. It is all stories. Stories are important to everything.</p>

still 2-3% of my monthly traffic, down from 5-8% for the last couple of years, and it was written in 2012 (five years ago). I’ve seen this story on the home page of the GSA internal portal, and framed hanging on the wall in a bank in Amsterdam. Stories are important. Stories are still important when they aren’t true, or partially true, like the Amazon mythical tale is(n’t). Stories are how we make sense of all this abstract stuff, and turn it into relatable concepts that we can use within the constructs of our own worlds. Stories are how the cloud became a thing. Stories are why microservices and Devops is becoming a thing. Stories are how GraphQL wants to be a thing.</p>

<p>For me, most importantly, telling stories is how I make sense of the world. If I can’t communicate something to you here on API Evangelist, it isn’t filed away in my mental filing cabinet. Telling stories is how I have made sense of the API space. If I can’t articulate a coherent story around API related technology, and it just doesn’t make sense to me, it probably won’t stick around in my storytelling, research, and consulting strategy. Stories are everything to me. If they aren’t to you, it’s probably because you are more on the receiving end of stories, and not really influencing those around you in your community, and workplace. Stories are important. Whether you want to admit it or not.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/07/24/first-handful-of-lessons-using-my-google-sheet-github-approach/">I’m working on a number of API courses and lessons lately</a>. Some of these are API 101 courses, while others are more advanced courses for the seasoned API provider, and consumer. As I think about what is needed when it comes to classes and workshops across the API sector, I’m considering doing an API Kindergarten series, where business and IT leaders can learn the basics of doing business with APIs.</p>

<p>The curriculum for the API kindergarten program include hands on lessons on how to play nicely, get along with others, the importance of sharing, and helping them learn the important soft skills like not shitting your pants. I’m always surprised at the lack of basic skills by company, organizational, institutional, and government leadership when it comes to the essentials of why APIs work, and think a little primer on things might help some realize they shouldn’t be doing APIs in the first place, or maybe prevent some major crisis down the road.</p>

<p>The number of folks who tell me directly that they are all in on this API thing, yet when it comes to practice clearly are not has grown significantly in 2017. I feel like we need a whole series or curriculum to help make sure business and IT leadership is up for the challenge is desperately needed. Just wait, until I begin working on my sex edit course for the middle schoolers, where we teach them about safely integrating, and what is appropriate API behavior, and what is not. Honestly, I could spend days finding equivalences between the real world and doing APIs (not real world) and creating classes around them–fun stuff!</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Aug 2017</span>
        <p>I spend a lot of time monitoring API platforms, thinking about different ways of identifying which ones are taking control of the conversation around how their platforms operate. One example of this out in the wild can be found when it comes to bots, by doing a quick look at which of the major bot platforms own the conversation around this automation going on via their platforms.</p>

<p>First you take a look at Twitter, by doing a quick Google search for Twitter Bots:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bots/bots-twitter-search.png" align="center" width="65%" /></p>

<p>Then you take a look at Facebook, by doing a quick Google search for Facebook Bots:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bots/bots-facebook-search.png" align="center" width="65%" /></p>

<p>Finally take a look at Slack, by doing a quick Google search for Slack Bots:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bots/bots-slack-search.png" align="center" width="65%" /></p>

<p>It is pretty clear who owns the conversation when it comes to bots on their platform. While Twitter and Facebook both have information and guidance about doing bots they do not own the conversation like Slack does. Something that is reflected in the search engine placement. It is also something that sets the tone of the conversation that is going on within the community, and defines the types of bots that will emerge on the platform.</p>

<p>As I’ve said before, if you have a web or mobile property online today, <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/07/11/either-you-own-the-conversation-around-your-apis-or-someone-else-will/">you need to be owning the conversation around your API or someone eventually will own it for you</a>. The same comes to automation around your platform, and the introduction of bots, and automated users, traffic, advertising, and other aspects of doing business online today. Honestly, I wouldn’t want to be in the business of running a platform these days. It is why I work so hard to dominate and own my own presence, just so that I can beat back what is said about me, and own the conversation on at least Google, Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Github.</p>

<p>Seems like to me, if you are going to enable automation on your platform via APIs, it should be something that you own completely, and make sure you provide some pretty strong guidance and direction.</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/security-api.html"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/elastic-search/elasticsearch-security-apis.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p>I was looking <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/security-api.html">at the set of security APIs over at Elasticsearch</a> as I was diving into my API security research recently. I thought the areas they provide security APIs for the search platform was worth noting and including in not just my API security research, but also <a href="http://search.apievangelist.com">search</a>, deployment, and probably overlap with <a href="http://authentication.apievangelist.com">my authentication research</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Authenticate API</strong> - The Authenticate API enables you to submit a request with a basic auth header to authenticate a user and retrieve information about the authenticated user.</li>
  <li><strong>Clear Cache API</strong> - The Clear Cache API evicts users from the user cache. You can completely clear the cache or evict specific users.</li>
  <li><strong>User Management APIs</strong> - The user API enables you to create, read, update, and delete users from the native realm. These users are commonly referred to as native users.</li>
  <li><strong>Role Management APIs</strong> - The Roles API enables you to add, remove, and retrieve roles in the native realm. To use this API, you must have at least the manage_security cluster privilege.</li>
  <li><strong>Role Mapping APIs</strong> - The Role Mapping API enables you to add, remove, and retrieve role-mappings. To use this API, you must have at least the manage_security cluster privilege.</li>
  <li><strong>Privilege APIs</strong> - The has_privileges API allows you to determine whether the logged in user has a specified list of privileges.</li>
  <li><strong>Token Management APIs</strong> - The token API enables you to create and invalidate bearer tokens for access without requiring basic authentication. The get token API takes the same parameters as a typical OAuth 2.0 token API except for the use of a JSON request body.</li>
</ul>

<p>Come to think of it, I’ll add this to my <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com">API management research</a> as well. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/03/04/adding-four-new-building-building-blocks-providing-an-api-management-api-blueprint/">Much of this overlaps with what should be a common set of API management services as well</a>. Like much of my research, there are many different dimensions to my API security research. I’m looking to see how API providers are securing their APIs, as well as how service providers are selling security services to APIs providers. I’m also keen on aggregating common API design patterns for security APIs, and quantity how they overlap with other stops along the API lifecycle.</p>

<p>While the cache API is pretty closely aligned with delivering a search API, I think all of these APIs provide a potential building block to think about when you are deploying any API, and represents the Venn diagram that is API authentication, management, and security. I’m going through the rest of the <a href="https://www.elastic.co/">Elasticsearch</a> platform looking for interesting approaches to ensuring their search solutions are secure. I don’t feel like there are any search specific characteristics of API security that I will need to include in my final API security industry guide, but Elasticsearch’s approach has re-enforced some of the existing security building blocks I already had on my list.</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/progrium/web-hooks-and-the-programmable-world-of-tomorrow-presentation/21-REST_Hooksrest_and_web_hooks"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/webhooks/RESTHooks.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p>I am getting to work on a base set of webhook specification for <a href="http://org.open.referral.adopta.agency/">my human services data API work</a>, and I wanted to take a fresh drive through a handful of the leading APIs I’m tracking on. I’m needing to make some recommendations regarding how human services data APIs should be pushing information via APIs, as we as providing APIs. Webhooks are fascinating to me because they really are just APIs in reverse. Webhooks are just an API request, where the target URL is a variable, allowing an API call to be made from a platform, to any target URL, on an triggering events, or on a schedule as a job.</p>

<p>Here are six of the API providers I took a look at while doing this webhook research:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://developer.box.com/v2.0/docs/getting-started-with-webhooks-v2"><strong>Box</strong></a></li>
  <li><a href="[https://gumroad.com/webhooks"><strong>Gumroad</strong></a></li>
  <li><a href="https://developer.venmo.com/docs/webhooks"><strong>Venmo</strong></a></li>
  <li><a href="https://developer.github.com/webhooks/"><strong>Github</strong></a></li>
  <li><a href="https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks"><strong>Stripe</strong></a></li>
  <li><a href="https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks"><strong>Slack</strong></a></li>
</ul>

<p>All of these API providers offer webhooks, allowing developers to create an API call that will be fired off when a specific event occurs. These events are usually tied to a specific object. Box is documents. Github is a repository. Stripe is a payment. With human services it will be an organization, location, or service. There are a handful of key concepts at play when it comes to webhooks, making them an important part of the equation:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Object</strong> - The object in which an event is occurring. For this project it is organizations, locations, services, contacts, and potentially other elements of API operations.</li>
  <li><strong>Events</strong>  - This is a list of events that can occur against all the objects that will trigger the execution of a webhook.</li>
  <li><strong>Target</strong> - The URL of the webhook. This is the variable of the outgoing API call, allowing them to be defined by API consumers, nd executed by the API provider.</li>
  <li><strong>Fat</strong> - The webhook will carry a payload, submitting a predefined schema, usually of the associated object to the target.</li>
  <li><strong>Ping</strong> - The webhook does not carry a payload, simply pinging the target of a webhook, letting API consumers know an even has occurred.</li>
  <li><strong>Status</strong> - The ability to identify the status of a webhook.</li>
  <li><strong>Errors</strong> - The errors that should be returned as part of webhook execution, and shared as it’s status.</li>
  <li><strong>Retries</strong> - Allowing for webhook execution to be replayed, executing a specific event that occurred in the past.</li>
  <li><strong>Signatures</strong> - Allowing for the signature of each webhook request to be verified for security and integrity purposes.</li>
  <li><strong>Test</strong> - Enable API cnosumers to test a webhook and see if it will work, sending over real or sample data.</li>
  <li><strong>History</strong> - Providing a complete history of webhook execution for API consumers to search, browse, and review.</li>
</ul>

<p>The external focus, and their event based nature are the most notable characteristics of a webhook, but it is the transactional nature of their supporting systems that seem to make them such a utility that can help alleviate the load on APIs. There are a number of other characteristics of webhooks, but this gets at the core of what they do, and provide me with what I need to move my human services API conversations forward. I’m looking to have a handful of examples of webhook implementations for well-known API platforms to share with folks, and begin setting the stage for an initial API design and definition for a human services webhook implementation, based upon common practices already in use.</p>

<p>I find webhooks interesting because are not a standard, and there really aren’t much in the way of best practices. Just some common examples of how they are used by existing API providers. Webhooks are just APIs. It is just the target URL that is variable, and the objects and events that can be unique to each API platform. In human services implementations I don’t just see webhooks as being about making API calls to other applications. I see webhooks as something that can satisfy pushing of data between many different API implementations, beginning to set the stage for interoperability between hundreds or even thousands of human service providers, pushing and pulling data as needed, and prescribed by each API provider. Allowing human service providers to speak a common language and seamlessly share information across a variety of partnerships. Getting closer to Greg Bloom’s vision, the creator of <a href="http://openreferral.org">Open Referral</a>, and the person behind the Human Services Data Specification (HSDS), for how all of this should be working.</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Aug 2017</span>

<p>Part of the feedback I’ve received from <a href="https://openreferral.github.io/api-specification/definition/">the Human Services Data API (HSDA) evolution from v1.0 to v1.1</a> was that the API didn’t allow for volume or bulk GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE. This was intentionally in the incremental release which focused on just making sure the API reflected 100% of the surface are for the Human Services Data Specification (HSDS). I wanted to separate out the needs of bulk API consumers, so that I could think about it separately from the more simple, micro-use integrations the default Human Services Data API would accommodate. I don’t want the industrial grade needs of database and system administrators overriding the simple access needs of other individual API consumers.</p>

<p>To kick off my human services bulk API definition I wanted to spend some time looking at other bulk implementations from a handful of leading providers:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://developers.intercom.com/v2.0/page/bulk-api-overview">Intercom</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-bulk.html">ElasticSearch</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/page/File:Bulk_overview.png">SalesForce</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.diffbot.com/dev/docs/bulk/">Diffbot</a></li>
</ul>

<p>As I went through these implementations, and searched through Stack Overflow about bulk HTTP POSTs, I really didn’t see much difference on the technical front. Bulk APIs are primarily about acknowledging heavy duty data consumption, and primarily used HTTP POST for allowing the submission of either a) large individual POST, or b) large number of POST. Technically there isn’t much to them, where you start finding the nuance of bulk APIs over regular APIs is in the process surrounding the API implementation, things like having tasks, jobs, history, notifications, webhooks, email, and logging. Meaning there is just a lot more process and expectation around these APIs, which also most likely translates into more robust background architecture, and rules regarding the process involved with access.</p>

<p>Bulk APIs seem more about a separation of concerns. Bulk GET and POSTs require more infrastructure, and to do it properly you need process, and checks and balances to make sure a bulk operation is successfully executed, and there is sufficient history, notifications, and other events around bulk transactions. I’d say that bulk API operations should always be approached as a separate concern from the more mainstream web, mobile, single page application, embeddable, and spreadsheet applications. Providing a separate API subdomain, or paths allowing for the separation of infrastructure concerns, to make sure the API meets the availability concerns of both API provider and consumer. Next, I’ll spend some more time mapping out the task or job oriented structure of bulk APIs, but also for other API operations, to help make sure I do not reinvent the wheel when it comes to the design of my bulk API operations.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/algo-rotoscope/stories/algo-microservices.jpg" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p><a href="http://org.open.referral.adopta.agency/">The Human Services Data API I have been working on is about defining a set of API paths for working with organizations, locations, and services that are delivering human services in cities around the world</a>. As I’m working to evolve the OpenAPI for the Human Services Data API (HSDA), I’m constantly mindful of bloat, unnecessary expansion of features, and always working to separate things by concern. My thoughts have evolved this due to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/08/11/a-hack-day-event-to-help-the-link-sf-app-speak-human-services-data-specification/">a hackathon I attended this week in San Francisco where a team at Optmizely worked to decouple an existing human services application from its backend and help teach it to speak Human Services Data Specification (HSDS)</a>–allowing it to speak a common language around the services that us humans depend on daily.</p>

<p>As the hackathon team was decoupling the single page application (React) from the API backend (Firebase) I took the API calls behind and published to Github as two JSON files. <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/optimizely/linksf/master/core/sf_location.json">One of the files was locations, which contained 217 human service locations in San Francisco</a>, and metadata, which contained a handful of categories being used to organize and display the locations. In this situation, there is no notion of an organization, just 217 locations, offering human services across five categories. This legacy application, and forward engineering hackathon project was quickly becoming a microservices project, ironically it is a microservice project that was about delivering human services. ;-)</p>

<p>Looking at this unfolding project through a microservices lens, I needed to provide a single service. In the context <a href="https://link-sf.com/">of Link-SF</a>, the original project, I needed to offer a service that would deliver 217 locations where people can find human services in the areas of food, housing, hygiene, medical, and technology via an web, or mobile application. To help me achieve my goals I began to step through each of the steps of the lifecycle of any self-contained microservices:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Github - Each of my services begins with a Github repository, <a href="https://github.com/adopta-agency/human-services-link/">so I created a new repo</a>.</li>
  <li>Definitions - I defined the service I wanted as <a href="https://github.com/adopta-agency/human-services-link/blob/master/_data/api-commons/openapi.yaml">an OpenAPI</a>.</li>
  <li>Design - I worked to keep the design of it as simple as I possibly can.</li>
  <li>DNS - I relied on Github’s DNS for this service, but may setup my own subdomain.</li>
  <li>Database - I published a YAML data file into the data folder for the Github repository, acting as the database for my service, leverage Github and Jekyll for helping me broker database connectivity.</li>
  <li>Deployment - I deployed <a href="https://adopta-agency.github.io/human-services-link/apis/locations.json">a simple static JSON API</a> driven from the locations YAML store.</li>
  <li>Management - I am using Github as the management platform for my API, helping me deploy and manage consumption of my service. I’m using the Github API as the programmatic layer for managing my service operations to help me continuously deploy and integrate with this service.</li>
  <li>Portal - I am using Github pages as the portal for my service, providing both human and programmatic access to my service, making human service locations more available.</li>
  <li>Documentation - I published static HTML, and Swagger UI documentation for the service.</li>
  <li>Support - I have published a support page, and will be providing support via Github issues, Twitter, and email.</li>
  <li>Communications - I have a blog published, and will be publishing the story of the service using the Jekyll CMS blogging solution.</li>
  <li>Caching - The API, portal, and all aspects of the service I’ve launched is being cached by Github, riding on the backs of their Content Delivery Network (CDN).</li>
  <li>Reliability - While Github has been known to have stability issues, it is still some of the most reliable way to host data and API driven services.</li>
  <li>Encryption - I’m leveraging the Github DNS, and using their encryption in transit by default. I will be using my own subdomain and encryption in the future.</li>
  <li>Security - I’m offloading platform security to Github. They have more resources than I do. I’m also looking to keep things more secure be keeping my services as static as possible.</li>
  <li>Testing - I am setting up a series of monitors to ensure the service stays available, and delivering expected data and promised schema. I will be publishing a status update and history page.</li>
  <li>Transparency - Everything involved with my service runs on Github, either as a public or private repository, with the entire lifecycle transparent publicly, or privately to whoever is given access to the repository using Github.</li>
  <li>Observability - The entire service runs on Github. The entire lifecycle is observable in the Github history, and leverage their existing infrastructure for identity and access management (IAM), and continuous integration and deployment.</li>
  <li>Discovery - There is an APIs.json available in the root of the project, providing a machine readable index of the schema, data, API, and other resources available via this service.</li>
  <li>Client - I’ve published an HTML / JavaScript client on the home page of the project, with an editor for managing the data, which leverages the Github API for reading and writing data to the services repository.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m calling my new service, born out of the Link-SF legacy application <a href="https://adopta-agency.github.io/human-services-link/">Human Services Link</a>. However, the only thing remaining of the Link-SF application is the data. I’ve forward engineered the schema, API, and web interface to all run on Github as a single, yet decoupled service. It is a reduction of the overall Human Services Data Specification (HSDS) schema, focusing in on just providing services at a handful of locations, reducing complexity and scope, to deliver a specific service–do one thing and do it well. I will be launching an Amazon EC2, and containerized version of this human services microservice, but I wanted to look at this one incarnation of it though the microservices lens. Sure, its not your classic microservices definition, but I think it holds up to a microservices test, it just makes some different architectural choices than the rest of the community might have made.</p>

<p>My human services microservice definition solves a single problem, for a specific type of end-user. It was originally geographically limited to San Francisco, but with with this evolution I’ve made sure there is a state/province field, as well as country, so that solution can be deployed for any city. I want the compute, database, DNS, API, portal, docs, and UI elements and admin tools to all be self contained for the delivery of a single microservice, but I wanted it all forkable, so you could launch this service over and over, in any city around the globe. There is still a lot of work to be done on this project before it is ready for prime time, but I’ve planted the seeds when it comes to delivering microservices in my world this way. I’m hoping it will be something I can’t ignore, and will keep pushing forward as part of my overall vision of how we can deliver sustainable API driven services.</p>

<p>I really like the static nature of this approach. I really like the forkability of this approach, and how you can use Github to separate out concerns by organization. I really like how I can offload much of the operation of my backend to Github, including security, CDN, and scalability / reliability. It is definitely not a pattern everyone should be following when doing microservices, but it does provide a static forkable pattern that can really help keep services very focused and self contained, but available to work in service of a bigger architectural picture. I’ll keep playing around with this approach to delivering human service microservices, and see what I can push forward and make stick. I’m hoping it can providing a low coast way for cash strapped municipalities to better deliver up to date information about human services to their entire population.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Aug 2017</span>

<p><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/08/14/some-microservice-thoughts-around-my-human-services-api-work/">I’ve been looking at my human services API work through a microservices lens, triggered by the deployment of a reduced functionality version of the human services implementation I was working on this week</a>. I’m thinking a lot about the technical side of decoupling services using APIs, but I want to also take a moment and think about the business side of decomposing services, while also making sure they are deployed in a way that meets both the provider and consumer side of the business equation. My human services microservice implementation is in the public service, which is a space where the business conversation often seems to disappear behind closed doors, but in reality needs to be front and center with each investment (commit) made into any service.</p>

<p>Let’s take a moment to look at the monetization strategy and operational plan for my human service microservice. Yes, a public data microservice should have a monetization strategy and plan for operating and remaining sustainable. The goals for this type of microservice will be radically different than it would be for a commercial microservice, but it should have one all the same.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Monetization - How am I evaluating the investment into this project alongside any value that is generated, which I can potentially capture or exchange some value for some money to keep going.
    <ul>
      <li>Acquisition - What did it take for me to acquire the data and skills necessary to make the deployment possible.</li>
      <li>Development - What time was invested in setting up the platform, developing the schema, data, definitions, code, and visual elements.</li>
      <li>Operations - What does it take to operate the service? Maintain it, answer questions, provide support, and other realities of providing an online service today.</li>
      <li>Direct Value - What are the direct benefits of having this service available to people looking for human services, or organizations looking to provide human services.</li>
      <li>Indirect Value - What are the indirect benefits of having this service available, like increased conversation around human services, or maybe traffic and awareness of the Open Referral organization.</li>
      <li>Partners - What partnership opportunities are actively being sought out, or will be opened up by having this service available.</li>
      <li>Reporting - What type of reporting is necessary to operate and monetize this service, from tracking page views to understanding who is integrated with the data, and consuming data via APIs, or possibly through continuous integration of the Github repository.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Plan - What is my plan for making this service available to the public, partners, or maybe internally use across my own projects.
    <ul>
      <li>Elements - My human services location API is designed to be publicly available, forkable, and reusable by anyone.</li>
      <li>Limits - There are no limits on how each human services microservice can be used, or forked and reused. Ideally, any implementation provides attribution, and acknowledges the source of framework or data, but there really are no rules.</li>
      <li>Metrics - I am measuring unique page views on each page, including of the machine readable YAML, JSON, and other formats. I’m also tracking on stars, forks, and commits for each service.</li>
      <li>Commercial - Providing a clear track for commercial vendors to understand that the project needs their support, and can be improved upon, and evolved through their underwriting and support.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I need to have a coherent snapshot of what I’ve invested into each of my service. I need to have a base plan for how I will be executing the business side of this service–even if it just making something available for free. There are two dimensions to this conversation: 1) My view as the creator of this service 2) The view of folks who fork and implement as a service. Both dimensions should have a monetization snapshot, and a plan for executing within this business snapshot. I need all of this decoupled from any other service I am offering, but ideally they all use a common set of reusable patterns, just like the technical aspects of my microservices effort.</p>

<p>Just like needing the compute, database, DNS, and other technical layers to be stable and scalable across my microservices, I need the costs associated with these elements predictable and affordable. I need to know what it costs to define, design, deploy, manage, and deprecate my services. I need to know the best path forward for making them public, keeping them private, and being honest with commercial partners about the value that is being generated, both directly and indirectly. I need a way to report my costs, and revenue across hundreds or thousands of these services. I need to be able to scale this both horizontally across many services, but also vertically for single services which get deployed over and over, reused and continuously integrate wherever they are needed using Github.</p>

<p>I’ll keep applying this model across my human services project. I’m thinking that I’m going to be developing a whole buffet of human service microservices that run a 100% on Github like this, but I am also playing around with other varietals that run on other popular cloud platforms as well. I’m not one to subscribe to any particular API dogma, I’m just looking to explore what is possible, and do all of it as cheaply as I possibly scan, growing the number of projects I’m able to tackle. Of course, none of this would be possible without my partners funding my work, and helping me connect the technical and business aspects of doing API Evangelist.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/answers/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/amazon/aws-answers-icons.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p>The discussion around whether or not you should be hosting your own questions and answers (QA) and frequently asked questions (FAQ) for your API has continued, with many of the leading API pioneers asserting responsibility over the operations of these important API resources. Amazon noticed that answers about their platform on Quora and Stack Exchange were usually out of date and often just plain wrong, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/answers/">prompting them to launch their own QA solution</a>.</p>

<p>I have written about using API providers using Stack Overflow for may years now. It the last few years I’ve had my readers push back on this for a variety of reasons, from the Stack Overflow community being primarily a white male bro-fest, to finding things being unreliable, out of date, and often a pretty hostile and unfriendly place for people to try and learn about APIs. I’d say that I still use Stack Overflow for about 40% of my querying of API and programming related subjects, but since I’m a white male who has been doing software for 30 years, I’m a little more resistant to the bro-fest. But, I get it, and hear what  folks are saying, and get it is not always a suitable environment.</p>

<p>Going back and forth on this subject, I’m back in the camp where API providers should be investing in operating their own QA, FAQ, and support forums. It’s definitely requires a significant amount of investment, policing, and sometimes taking stances that are unpopular, but if you are in this for the long game, it will be worth it. After watching AWS for a decade, you can see how incorrect information about your API operations can really begin to become a liability, and you might want to keep a tighter grip on where your API consumers go look for their answers. An added bonus is that you also get to set the tone for the types of questions that get answered, and the inclusiveness that will exist across your FAQ, QA, and Support.</p>

<p>I really need to get my core API design guides like <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">definitions</a>, <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/">design</a>, <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com/">deployment</a>, and <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/">management</a> out the door, because I need to diving into areas like support, and gather all my thoughts regarding how API providers should be approaching this critical layer of operations. I feel like support is one of the most defining characteristics of sustainable API providers, right up there with communications I’d say. I don’t care how good your API is technically, if you don’t have a solid approach to supporting and communicating with your API community, I’m guessing you won’t be around very long, or if you do survive, your platform will be something savvy API consumers steer clear of.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/photos/light-wheel.jpg" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I was on a call the other day with a group of people who are in the trenches of organizations and companies working hard to deliver human services in cities around the country. We were meeting to kick of the design phase of a new type of API, and after they shared all their thoughts via project documentation, they were asking me to help identify examples of best practices from the space. The group felt they didn’t have the time, or the awareness of what is going on to be able to identify the best practices that already exist across the space.</p>

<p>This is one of the reasons I stay out of the weeds of individual projects. I may help define, design, and even shadow the deployment and management, but I work hard to avoid the tractor beam of ongoing projects so that I can pay attention to the bigger picture and help share stories about what I’m seeing. I feel like there should be people like me in each industry helping shine a light on, and aggregating of best practices when it comes to the API life cycle. There is just too much work to be done, and it helps to have folks who have domain expertise, not just lightly understanding what is going on across many sectors like I do.</p>

<p>I think it is fine for the sector to depend on API analysts like me, but I think that groups should also be investing in the time to pick up their heads up and pay attention to what else is going on when it comes to APIs in their industry. I understand that many groups are busy keeping systems operational, and dealing with real world problems, but dedicated reading of blogs, white papers, and tuning into social channels for other API providers is important as well. Each decision made on API design, deployment, and management should be established from time spent reading, and learning about other existing approaches–minimizing the amount of wheel reinvention that occurs.</p>

<p>The amount of time you invest in learning about other successful API providers will pay off in the amount of time it saves you when defining, designing, deploying, and managing an API. Sadly, it is one of those areas that some companies aren’t always equipped to measure the return on investment from something like this, resulting in many companies limiting the amount of time API developers spend reading blogs, and actively researching existing implementations, leading design patterns, and healthy API practices. If your boss is ever giving you grief about the amount of time you are spending on learning about other APIs, make sure and point them in my direction. I’m happy to help them understand why you don’t want to be reinventing the wheel when it comes to web APIs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">11 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wilde-service-link-rel-03"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/erik-wilde/link-relation-types-for-web-services.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p>I have been reading through a number of specifications lately, trying to get more up to speed on what standards are available for me to choose from when designing APIs. Next up on my list is <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wilde-service-link-rel-03">Link Relation Types for Web Services</a>, by Erik Wilde. I wanted to take this informational specification and repost here on my site, partially because I find it easier to read, and the process of breaking things down and publishing as a posts helps me digest the specification and absorb more of what it contains.</p>

<p>I’m particularly interested in this one, because Erik captures what I’ve had in my head for APIs.json property types, but haven’t been able to always articulate as well as Erik does, let alone published as an official specification. I think his argument captures the challenge we face with mapping out the structure we have, and how we can balance the web with the API, making sure as much of it becomes machine readable as possible. I’ve grabbed the meat of Link Relation Types for Web Services and pasted here, so I can break down, and reference across my storytelling.</p>

<hr />

<ol>
  <li>Introduction<br />
One of the defining aspects of the Web is that it is possible to interact with Web resources without any prior knowledge of the specifics of the resource.  Following Web Architecture by using URIs, HTTP, and media types, the Web’s uniform interface allows interactions with resources without the more complex binding procedures of other approaches.</li>
</ol>

<p>Many resources on the Web are provided as part of a set of resources that are referred to as a “Web Service” or a “Web API”.  In many cases, these services or APIs are defined and managed as a whole, and it may be desirable for clients to be able to discover this service information.</p>

<p>Service information can be broadly separated into two categories: One category is primarily targeted for human users and often uses generic representations for human readable documents, such as HTML or PDF. The other category is structured information that follows some more formalized description model, and is primarily intended for consumption by machines, for example for tools and code libraries.</p>

<p>In the context of this memo, the human-oriented variant is referred to as “documentation”, and the machine-oriented variant is referred to as “description”.</p>

<p>These two categories are not necessarily mutually exclusive, as there are representations that have been proposed that are intended for both human consumption, and for interpretation by machine clients. In addition, a typical pattern for service documentation/description is that there is human-oriented high-level documentation that is intended to put a service in context and explain the general model, which is complemented by a machine-level description that is intended as a detailed technical description of the service.  These two resources could be interlinked, but since they are intended for different audiences, it can make sense to provide entry points for both of them.</p>

<p>This memo places no constraints on the specific representations used for either of those two categories.  It simply allows providers of aWeb service to make the documentation and/or the description of their services discoverable, and defines two link relations that serve that purpose.</p>

<p>In addition, this memo defines a link relation that allows providers of a Web service to link to a resource that represents status information about the service.  This information often represents operational information that allows service consumers to retrieve information about “service health” and related issues.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Terminology<br />
The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”,”SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Web Services<br />
“Web Services” or “Web APIs” (sometimes also referred to as “HTTP API” or “REST API”) are a way to expose information and services on the Web. Following the principles of Web architecture[ they expose URI-identified resources, which are then accessed and transferred using a specific representation.  Many services use representations that contain links, and often these links are typed links.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Using typed links, resources can identify relationship types to other resources.  RFC 5988 [RFC5988] establishes a framework of registered link relation types, which are identified by simple strings and registered in an IANA registry.  Any resource that supports typed links according to RFC 5988 can then use these identifiers to represent resource relationships on the Web without having to re-invent registered relation types.</p>

<p>In recent years, Web services as well as their documentation and description languages have gained popularity, due to the general popularity of the Web as a platform for providing information and services.  However, the design of documentation and description languages varies with a number of factors, such as the general application domain, the preferred application data model, and the preferred approach for exposing services.</p>

<p>This specification allows service providers to use a unified way to link to service documentation and/or description.  This link should not make any assumptions about the provided type of documentation and/or description, so that service providers can choose the ones that best fit their services and needs.</p>

<p>3.1.  Documenting Web Services<br />
In the context of this specification, “documentation” refers to information that is primarily intended for human consumption.Typical representations for this kind of documentation are HTML andPDF.</p>

<p>Documentation is often structured, but the exact kind of structure depends on the structure of the service that is documented, as well as on the specific way in which the documentation authors choose to document it.</p>

<p>3.2.  Describing Web Services<br />
In the context of this specification, “description” refers to information that is primarily intended for machine consumption.Typical representations for this are dictated by the technology underlying the service itself, which means that in today’s technology landscape, description formats exist that are based on XML, JSON, RDF, and a variety of other structured data models.  Also, in each of those technologies, there may be a variety of languages that a redefined to achieve the same general purpose of describing a Web service.</p>

<p>Descriptions are always structured, but the structuring principles depend on the nature of the described service.  For example, one of the earlier service description approaches, the Web ServicesDescription Language (WSDL), uses “operations” as its core concept, which are essentially identical to function calls, because the underlying model is based on that of the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) model.  Other description languages for non-RPC approaches to services will use different structuring approaches.</p>

<p>3.3.  Unified Documentation/Description<br />
If service providers use an approach where there is no distinction of service documentation Section 3.1 and service descriptionSection 3.2, then they may not feel the need to use two separate links.  In such a case, an alternative approach is to use the”service” link relation type, which has no indication of whether it links to documentation or description, and thus may be better fit if no such differentiation is required.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Link Relations for Web Services<br />
In order to allow Web services to represent the relation of individual resources to service documentation or description, this specification introduces and registers two new link relation types.</li>
</ol>

<p>4.1.  The service-doc Link Relation Type<br />
The “service-doc” link relation type is used to represent the fact that a resource is part of a bigger set of resources that are documented at a specific URI.  The target resource is expected to provide documentation that is primarily intended for human consumption.</p>

<p>4.2.  The service-desc Link Relation Type<br />
The “service-desc” link relation type is used to represent the fact that a resource is part of a bigger set of resources that are described at a specific URI.  The target resource is expected to provide a service description that is primarily intended for machine consumption.  In many cases, it is provided in a representation that is consumed by tools, code libraries, or similar components.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Web Service Status Resources<br />
Web services providing access to a set of resources often are hosted and operated in an environment for which status information may be available.  This information may be as simple as confirming that a service is operational, or may provide additional information about different aspects of a service, and/or a history of status information, possibly listing incidents and their resolution.</li>
</ol>

<p>The “status” link relation type can be used to link to such a status resource, allowing service consumers to retrieve status information about a Web service’s status.  Such a link may not be available from all resources provided by a Web service, but from key resources such as a Web service’s home resource.</p>

<p>This memo does not restrict the representation of a status resource in any way.  It may be primarily focused on human or machine consumption, or a combination of both.  It may be a simple “traffic light” indicator for service health, or a more sophisticated representation conveying more detailed information such as service subsystems and/or a status history.</p>

<ol>
  <li>IANA Considerations<br />
The link relation types below have been registered by IANA perSection 6.2.1 of RFC 5988 [RFC5988]:</li>
</ol>

<p>6.1.  Link Relation Type: service-doc<br /></p>

<p>Relation Name: service-doc<br />
   Description: Linking to service documentation that is primarily   intended for human<br /> consumption.<br />
   Reference: [[ This document ]]<br /></p>

<p>6.2.  Link Relation Type: service-desc<br /></p>

<p>Relation Name: service-desc<br />
   Description: Linking to service description that is primarily   intended for consumption by machines.<br />
   Reference: [[ This document ]]<br /></p>

<p>6.3.  Link Relation Type: status<br /></p>

<p>Relation Name: status<br />
   Description: Linking to a resource that represents the status of a   Web service or API.<br />
   Reference: [[ This document ]]<br /></p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Adding Some Of My Own Thoughts Beyond The Specification</strong>
This specification provides a more coherent service-doc, and service-desc that I think we did with humanURL, and support for multiple API definition formats (swagger, api blueprint, raml) as properties for any API. This specification provides a clear solution for human consumption, as well as one intended for consumption by machines. Another interesting link relation it provides is status, helping articulate the current state of an API.</p>

<p>It makes me happy to see this specification pushing forward and formalizing the conversation. I see the evolution of link relations for APIs as an important part of the API discovery and definition conversations in coming years. Processing this specification has <a href="https://github.com/apis-json/api-json/issues">helped jumpstart some conversation around APIs.json</a>, as well as other specifications like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/08/03/api-discovery-using-json-home/">JSON Home</a> and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/08/03/microservice-discovery-using-pivio/">Pivio</a>.</p>

You can contribute to the development of this platform, or setup your own instance and run the entire stack yourself. If you’re interested in exploring any of this for your APIs, <a href="https://api.data.gov/contact/#apidatagov-service-contact">please contact us</a>. In general, it’s easy to take any existing API your agency has (or is in the process of building) and put api.data.gov in front of it. This can be an easy way to get started and see what type of functionality api.data.gov might provide for your API.</p>

<p><a href="https://api.data.gov">api.data.gov</a> is all about consistent API management across federal government, which means developers will be able to get at government data, content, and algorithms more efficiently, and integrate them into web, mobile, and other applications. We need more government agencies to be doing this, taking advantage of api.data.gov and get to work developing an awareness around who is consuming their API resources. Eventually API management will be how government agencies will be generating revenue on top  of valuable API resources, charging commercial users enough so that each agency can cover the costs of operations, and hopefully make more of an investment in the resources they are making available.</p>

        <span class="post-date">11 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/08/03/api-discovery-using-json-home/">I have been studying JSON Home</a>, trying to understand how it sizes up to <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/08/03/microservice-discovery-using-pivio/">other formats I’m tracking on like Pivio</a>. JSON Home has a number of interesting features, and I thought one of their examples was also interesting, and was relevant to <a href="http://embeddable.apievangelist.com/">my API embeddable research</a>. In this example, JSON Home was describing a widget that was putting an API to use as part of its operation.</p>

<p>Here is the snippet from the JSON Home example, providing all details of how it works:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/40fabbb3133ddd1c65249dfdc87999cd.js"></script>

<p>JSON Home seems very action oriented. Everything about the format leads you towards taking some sort of API driven action, something that makes a lot of sense when it comes to widgets and other embeddables. I could see JSON Home being used as some sort of definition for button or widget generation and building tooling, providing a machine readable definition for the embeddable tool, and what is possible with the API(s) behind.</p>

<p>I’ve been working towards embeddable directories and API stacks using APIs.json, providing distributed and embeddable tooling that API providers and consumers can publish anywhere. I will be spending more time thinking about how this world of API discovery can overlap with the world of API embeddables, providing not just a directory of buttons, badges, and widgets, but one that describes what is possible when you engage with any embeddable tool. I’m beginning to see JSON Home similar to how I see Postman Collections, something that is closer to runtime, or at least deploy time. Where APIs.json is much more about indexing, search, and discovery–maybe some detail about where the widgets are, or maybe more detail about what embeddable resources are available.</p>

        <span class="post-date">11 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/open-referral/optimizely/optimizely-hackathon.JPG" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I went up to San Francisco on Wednesday to participate in a social good hack day at <a href="https://www.optimizely.com/">Optimizely</a>. They held their event at their downtown offices, where 20+ employees showed up to hack on some social good projects. Open Referral and our partner <a href="https://www.benetech.org/">Benetech</a> had suggested Human Services Data Specification (HSDS) as a possible project, which resulted in us being one of the hack projects for the event.</p>

<p>The Open Referral Human Services Data Specification (HSDS) team consisted of five Optimizely developers.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Derek Hammond - Software Engineer</li>
  <li>Michael Fields - Software Engineer</li>
  <li>Zachary Power - Software Engineering Intern</li>
  <li>Quinton Dang - Software Engineer</li>
  <li>Asa Schachar - Engineering Manager</li>
</ul>

<p>The overall strength of the team leaned toward being front-end web and mobile developers, so we decided <a href="https://github.com/zendesk/linksf">to “forward engineer” the Link-SF application</a>, which provides a simple web or mobile application to help folks find a variety of human services in a handful of categories like food, housing, hygiene, medical, and technology. Link-SF is an ongoing collaboration between the <a href="http://www.tenderlointechnologylab.org/">Tenderloin Technology Lab</a> and <a href="http://www.zendesk.com/">Zendesk, Inc.</a>, and we wanted to help contribute to their work, while also making the application potentially deployable by other cities and regions.</p>

<p>Once the team got to work on the project they identified that we could get at the data behind the SF application. The team decide they would forward engineer the dataset, the API, and the UI for the web and mobile application, making it all speak <a href="https://github.com/openreferral/specification">Human Services Data Specification (HSDS)</a>–here is what they did:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Took the Link-SF datasets and saved as a single JSON file.</li>
  <li>Converted the JSON schema to use HSDS – the changes weren’t significant.</li>
  <li>Made it so that the app reads <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/optimizely/linksf/master/core/sf_location.json">location data from a Github repository</a> (you can change this to your url)</li>
  <li>Updated the taxonomy fetch to use the new data</li>
  <li>Ensured the UI worked with the new data</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://github.com/optimizely/linksf">You can find the project in an Optimizely Github repository</a>, which they are going to invest some more time into cleaning up this week–so don’t judge! ;-) If you want to run our app locally, <a href="https://github.com/optimizely/linksf/blob/master/docs/SETUP.md">you can save a file as <code class="highlighter-rouge">config.js</code>and follow the instructions on the setup page</a>. I am going to play with the application some more, and wait for them to clean up the page before we add the project to our official open source Human Services Data Specification (HSDS) solutions. Adding another HSDS compliant tool that any city, county, or other organization could deploy for their own purposes.</p>

<p>We didn’t have much time for the hackathon. It went from 2:30 PM to 8:30 PM, and I was impressed what the team was able to get done. I like their hack which used Github as a backend, and the speed at which they were able to work together to fork the application and make working using HSDS. It provides an interesting open source blueprint that other cities could also fork, and implement with their own localized datasets. Their work shows what is possible when you decouple the backend API (or JSON file) from the front-end application, and utilize a common schema and API definition. It transforms the application from a single use application into a multi-use application that can be used over and over again.</p>

<p>Thank you to <a href="https://www.optimizely.com/">Optimizely</a> for putting on the hackathon. Thank you to <a href="https://www.benetech.org/">Benetech</a> for making the event happen. Thank you to the five developers who help moved the HSDS conversation forward. Once the Github repository gets cleaned up, I will spend some time playing with the application, and publish a follow-up story. I’d like to make the project push button deployable, so that organizations could launch a new instance of Link-[Any City] for low or no cost. We have another hackathon coming up in September on the east coast, and I learned a lot at this one about what I should have ready when it comes to help hackers be successful in the short time we have. It has been a while since I’ve attended a hackathon, and forgot how they can be a good vehicle for moving projects forward–at least the social good type of event. ;-)</p>

<p>I have been slowly evolving my network of websites in 2017, overhauling the look of them, as well as how they function. I am investing cycles into pushing as much of my infrastructure towards being as static as possible, minimizing my usage of JavaScript wherever I can. I am still using a significant amount of JavaScript libraries across my sites for a variety of use cases, but whenever I can, I am looking to kill my JavaScript or backend dependencies, and reduce the opportunity for any tracking and surveillance.</p>

<p>While I still keep Google Analytics on my primary API Evangelist sites, as my revenue depends on it, whenever possible I keep personal projects without any JavaScript tracking mechanisms. Instead of JavaScript I am defaulting to image logging using Amazon S3. Most of my sites tend to have some sort of header image, which I store in a common public bucket on Amazon S3, all I have to do is turn on logging, and then get at logging details via the Amazon S3 API. Of course, images get cached within a user’s browser, but the GET for my images still gives me a pretty good set of numbers to work with. I’m not concerned with too much detail, I just generally want to understand the scope of traffic a project is getting, and whether it is 5, 50, 500, 5,000, or 50,000 visitors.</p>

<p>My two primary CDNs are Amazon S3 and Github. I’m trying to pull together a base strategy for monitoring activity across my digital footprint. My business presence is very different than my personal presence, but with some of my personal writing, photography, and other creations I still like to keep a finger on the pulse of what is happening. I am just looking to minimize the data gathering and surveillance I am participating in these days. Keeping my personal and business websites static, and with a minimum footprint is increasingly important to me. I find that a minimum viable static digital footprint protects my interests, maximize my control over my work, and minimizes the impact to my readers and customers.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Aug 2017</span>

<p>The main reason that I tend to rail against API specific patents is that much of what I see being locks up reflects the parts and pieces that are making the web work. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/01/12/i-just-cannot-get-behind-api-patents-especially-when-they-apply-to-http-and-hypermedia/">I see things like hypermedia, and other concepts that are inherently about sharing, collaboration, and reuse</a>–something that should never be patented. This concept applies to other patents I’m seeing, but rather than being about the web, it is about trust, and sharing of information. Things that shouldn’t be locked up, and exist within realms where the concept of patents actually hurt the web and APIs.</p>

<p>Today’s patent is out of Amazon, who are prolific patenters of web and API concepts. This one though is about <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect2=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PALL&amp;RefSrch=yes&amp;Query=PN/9325732">the sharing of security threat sharing</a>. Outlining something that should be commonplace on the web.</p>

<p>Title -  <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect2=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PALL&amp;RefSrch=yes&amp;Query=PN/9325732">Computer security threat sharing</a><br />
Number - 09325732<br />
Owner - Amazon Technologies, Inc.<br />
Abstract -  A computer security threat sharing technology is described. A computer security threat is recognized at an organization. A partner network graph is queried for security nodes connected to a first security node representing the organization. The first security node is connected to at least a second security node representing a trusted security partner of the organization. The second security node is associated with identification information. The computer security threat recognized by the organization is communicated to the trusted security partner using the identification information associated with the second security node.<br /></p>

<p>I’m sorry. I just do not see this as unique, original, or remotely a concept that should be patentable. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/08/08/patent-web-of-trust-management-in-a-distributed-system/">Similar to a previous patent I wrote about on trust</a>, I just don’t think that sharing of security information needs to be locked up. The USPTO should recognize this. I feel like this type of patent shows how broken the patent process is, and how distorted company’s views on what is a patentable idea. Honestly, these types of patents feel lazy to me, and lack any creativity, skills, or sensible view of how the web works.</p>

<p>I feel like I should start rating these patents with some sort of Rotten Tomato score, and start giving companies some sort of patent ranking for their portfolio. Something that encompasses the scope, lack of creativity, originality, and damaging effects of the patent. This reminds me that I need to finish my work pulling court cases <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest-info/">from the Court Listener API</a>, and index them for any companies, and their patent portfolios. Ultimately this is where the real damage to APIs and the web will play out, similar to <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/05/10/where-will-your-api-stand-in-the-oracle-v-google-api-copyright-debate/">the Oracle vs. Google API copyright affair</a>, but I will keep sharing stories of these ridiculous patents, and maybe even start ranking them all by how much they stink.</p>

<p>A regular thing I hear from folks when we are having conversations about the API lifecycle, is that I focus on public APIs, and they are more interested in private APIs. Each time I hear this I try to take time and assess which parts of my public API research wouldn’t apply to internal APIs. You wouldn’t publish your APIs to pubic API search engines like APIs.io or ProgrammableWeb, and maybe not evangelizing your APIs at hackathons, but I’d say 90% of what I study is applicable to internal APIs, as well as publicly available APIs.</p>

<p>With internal APIs, or private network partner APIs you still need a portal, documentation, SDKs, support mechanisms, and communication and feedback loops. Sure, how you use the common building blocks of API operations that I track on will vary between private and public APIs, but this shifts from industry to industry, and API to API as well–it isn’t just a public vs. private thing. I would say that 75% of my API industry research is derived from public API operations–it is just easier to access, and honestly more interesting to cover than private ones. The other 25% of internal API conversation I’m having, always benefit from thinking through the common API building blocks of public APIs, looking for ways they can be more successful with internal and partner APIs.</p>

<p>I’d say that a significant part of the mindshare for the microservices philosophy is internally focused. I think this is something that will come back to hurt some implementations, cutting out many of the mechanisms and common elements required in a successful API formula. Things like portals, documentations, SDKs, testing, monitoring, discovery, support, communications all contribute to an API working, or not working. I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again. I’m not convinced that there is any true separation in public vs private APIs, and there remains to be a great deal we can learn from public API providers, and put to work across internal operations, and with our most trusted partners.</p>

        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-bot-api.png" align="right" width="25%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>

<p>I’m looking into how to make <a href="http://security.apievangelist.com">API security</a> more transparent and observable lately, and looking for examples of companies, institutions, organizations, politicians, and the government are calling for observability into wherever APIs are impacting our world. Today’s example comes out of <a href="http://www.politico.com/tipsheets/morning-cybersecurity">POLITICO’s Morning Cybersecurity email newsletter</a>, which has become an amazing source of daily information for me, regarding transparency around the take down of bot networks.</p>

<p><em>“If private companies cooperate with government agencies - for example, in the takedown of botnets using the companies’ infrastructure - they should do so as publicly as possible, <a href="https://www.ntia.doc.gov/files/ntia/publications/cdt-ntia-nistcommentsbotnetsfinal.pdf">argued the Center for Democracy &amp; Technology</a> . “One upside to compulsory powers is that they presumptively become public eventually, and are usually overseen by judges or the legislative branch,” CDT argued in its filing. “Voluntary efforts run the risk of operating in the dark and obscuring a level of coordination that would be offensive to the general public. It is imperative that private actors do not evolve into state actors without all the attendant oversight and accountability that comes with the latter.”</em></p>

<p>I’ve been tracking on the transparency statements and initiatives of all the API platforms. At some point I’m going to assemble the common building blocks of what is needed for executing platform transparency, and I will be including these asks of the federal government. As the Center for Democracy &amp; Technology states this relationship between the public and private sector when it comes to platform surveillance needs to be more transparent and observable in all forms. Bots, IoT, and the negative impacts of API automation needs to be included in the transparency disclosure stack. If the government is working with platform to discover, surveil, or shutdown bot networks there should be some point in which operations should be shared, including the details of what was done.</p>

<p>We need platform <a href="http://transparency.apievangelist.com">transparency</a> and <a href="http://observability.apievangelist.com">observability</a> at the public and private sector layer of engagement. Sure, this sharing of information would be time sensitive, respecting any investigations and laws, but if private sector infrastructure is being used to surveil and shut down U.S. citizens there should be an accessible, audit-able log for this activity. Of course it should also have an API allowing auditors and researchers to get all relevant information. Bots are just one layer of the API security research I’m doing, and the overlap in the bot world when it comes to API transparency, observability, and security is an increasingly significant vector when it comes to policing, <a href="http://surveillance.apievangelist.com">surveillance</a>, but also when it comes to protecting the privacy and safety of platform people (citizens).</p>

<p>I was reading <a href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/procurement-data/tender-notice/PW-17-00786791">the Open by Default Portal Procurement Pilot for the Treasury Board of Canada</a>, where section 6, Licensing states: “To support the objectives of the open government initiative, the Solution must be open source and licensed in accordance with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology License (“MIT License”). Under the resulting contract, the Contractor will be required to deposit the Solution’s source code on the GitHub platform (https://github.com) – under the MIT License.”</p>

<p>This just seems like the way it should be for all government technology solutions. I’ve heard the naysayers in federal government say that proprietary software is the best route, but if it drives public infrastructure, in my opinion the code should be publicly available in this way. Honestly, code should be deployed at regular intervals throughout the development and deployment process, opening up the code to QA and security audits by the public, and 3rd parties. I hope this approach evolves into more of a continuous deployment and integration workflow when it comes to delivering software in government, where vendors have to plugin, open up their delivery cycles to more scrutiny, and leverage Github as the center of each procurement step from start to finish. Heck, let’s connect payments to each stop along the way.</p>

<p>I’m a proponent of this not just to make the delivery of government software more observable and accountable. I want this process out in the open to help other agencies learn from the journey. Tune into the process, and maybe reuse, build upon, and evolve existing solutions as part of their operations. I will keep an eye on what is going on up in Canada, when it comes to requiring vendors publish code to Github. I also know there are similar efforts in the U.S. and other countries which I’ll also start scratching at and learning more about. It is definitely a healthy pattern I’d like to see more of, and I will continue to invest time shining a light on any government taking a lead like Canada is.</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Aug 2017</span>

<p>I was reading about GOSINT, <a href="https://blogs.cisco.com/security/open-source-threat-intel-gosint">the open source intelligence gathering and processing framework over at Cisco</a>. “GOSINT allows a security analyst to collect and standardize structured and unstructured threat intelligence. Applying threat intelligence to security operations enriches alert data with additional confidence, context, and co-occurrence. This means that you are applying research from third parties to your event data to identify similar, or identical, indicators of malicious behavior.” The framework is written in Go, with a front-end in JavaScript frontend, and usage of APIs as threat intelligence sources.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/ciscocsirt/gosint">When you look at configuration section on the README for GOSINT</a>, you’ll see information for setting up threat intelligence feeds, including Twitter API, <a href="https://otx.alienvault.com/api/">Alien Vault the Open Threat Community API</a>, <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/">VirusTotal API</a>, and <a href="https://crits.github.io/">the Collaborative Research Into Threats (CRITS)</a>.  GOSINT acts as an API aggregator for a variety of threat information, which then allows you to scour the information for threat indicators, which you can evolve over time, providing a pretty interesting model for not just threat information sharing, but also API driven aggregation, curation and sharing.</p>

<p>GOSINT also has the notion of behaving as a “transfer station”, where you can export refined data as CSV or CRITS format. Right here seems like an opportunity for some Github integration, adding continuous integration and deployment to open source intelligence and processing workflows. Making sure refined, relevant threat information is available where it is needed, via existing API deployment and integration workflows. Wouldn’t take much to publish CSV, YAML, and JSON files to Github which can then be used to drive distributed dashboards, visualizations, and other awareness building tools. Plus, the refined threat information is now published as CSV/JSON/YAML on Github where it can be ingested by any system of application with access to the Github repository.</p>

<p>GOSINT is just one of the interesting tooling I’m coming across as I turn up the volume on <a href="http://security.apievangelist.com">my API security research</a>, thanks to <a href="https://www.elasticbeam.com/">the investment of ElasticBeam my API security partner</a>. They’ve invested in an API security guide, as well as white paper, which is something that will generate a wealth of stories like this along the way, as I find interesting API security artifacts. I’m looking to map out the API security landscape, but I’m also interested in understanding open source API aggregation, analysis, and syndication platforms that integrate with existing CI/CD workflows, to help feed <a href="http://org.open.referral.adopta.agency/">my existing human services API work</a>, and other city, state, and federal government API projects I’m working on.</p>

<p>I’m always on the hunt for healthy patterns that I would like to see API providers, and API service providers consider when crafting their own strategies. It’s what I do as the API Evangelist. Find common patterns. Understand the good ones, and the bad ones. Tell stories about both, helping folks understand the possibilities, and what they should be thinking about as they plan their operations.</p>

<p>One very useful API that notifies you about security vulnerabilities, license violations and out-dated dependencies in your Git repositories, <a href="https://www.versioneye.com/api/">has a nice approach to delivering their API</a>, as well as <a href="https://github.com/versioneye">the other components of their stack</a>. You can either use VersionEye in the cloud, or you can deploy on-premise:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/versioneye/versioneye-core">versioneye-core</a> - Models, Services &amp; Mails for VersionEye</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/versioneye/crawl_r">crawl_r</a> - VersionEye crawlers implemented in Ruby.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/versioneye/versioneye-security">versioneye-security</a> - Security Crawler for VersionEye</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/versioneye/versioneye-api">versioneye-api</a> - JSON REST API for VersionEye</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/versioneye/versioneye-tasks">versioneye-tasks</a> - Thin wrapper around the versioneye-core.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/versioneye/versioneye">versioneye</a> - VersionEye.com</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://hub.docker.com/u/versioneye/">VersionEye also has their entire stack available as Docker images</a>, ready for deployment anywhere you need them. I wanted have a single post that I can reference when talking about possible open source, on-premise, continuous integration approaches to delivering API solutions, that actually have a sensible business model. VersionEye spans the areas that I think API providers should consider investing in, delivering SaaS or on-premise, while also delivering open source solutions, and generating sensible amounts of revenue.</p>

<p>Many APIs I come across do not have an open source version of their API. They may have open source SDKs, and other tooling on Github, but rarely does an API provider offer up an open source copy of their API, as well as Docker images. VersionEye’s approach to operating in the cloud, and on-premise, while leveraging open source and APIs, as well as dovetailing with existing continuous integration flows is worth bookmarking. I am feeling like this is the future of API deployment and consumption, but don’t get nervous, there is still plenty of money to be be made via the cloud services.</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/twitter/twitter-websites-embeddable.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>Over the years I have regularly showcased Twitter as an example API driven embeddable tools like buttons, badges, and widgets. In 2017, after spending some time in the Twitter developer portal, it is good to see <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/products/web">Twitter still investing in their embeddable tools</a>. The landing page for the Twitter embeddables still provides the best example out there of the value of using APIs to drive data and content across a large number of remote web sites.</p>

<p>Twitter has distinct elements of their web embeddables:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tweet Button - That classic tweet button, allowing users to quickly Tweet from any website.</li>
  <li>Embedded Tweets - Taking any Tweet and embedding on a web page showing its full content.</li>
  <li>Embedded Timeline - Showing curated timelines on any website using a Twitter embeddable widget.</li>
  <li>Follow Button - Helping users quickly follow your Twitter account, or your companies Twitter account.</li>
  <li>Twitter Cards - Present link summaries, engaging images, product information, or inline video as embeddable cards in timeline.</li>
</ul>

<p>Account interactions, messaging, posting, and other API enabled function made portable using JavaScript allowing it to be embedded and executed on any website. JavaScript widgets, buttons, and other embeddables are still a very tangible, useful example of APIs in action. Something I can talk about to anyone about, helping them understand why you might want to do APIs, or at least know about APIs.</p>

<p>We bash on Twitter a lot in the API community. However, after a decade of operation, you have to give it to them. They are still doing it. They are still keeping it simple with embeddable tools like this. I can confidently say that APIs are automating some serious illness on the Twitter API platform at the moment, and there are many things I’d like to be different with the Twitter API, but I am still pleased that I can keep finding examples from the Twitter platform to showcase on API Evangelist seven years of writing about them.</p>

<p>I found a couple more API patents in my notebook that I wanted to get published. I try to take time regularly to publish the strangest API related patents I can find. Today’s patent is out of Amazon, which I find to be a fascinating outlet for patent storytelling. It isn’t squarely in the realm of APIs like some of my others, but I think tells a fascinating story by itself, showing how the web and the concept of a patent are colliding.</p>

<p>Title - <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect2=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PALL&amp;RefSrch=yes&amp;Query=PN/9397835">Web of trust management in a distributed system</a><br />
Number - 9397835<br />
Owner - Amazon Technologies, Inc.<br />
Publication Date - 2016-07-19<br />
Application Date - 2014-05-21<br /></p>

<p>Abstract - A web of trust is used to validate states of a distributed system. The distributed system operates based at least in part on a domain trust. A root of trust issues the domain trust issues a domain trust. Domain trusts are updatable in accordance with rules of previous domain trusts so that a version of a domain trust is verifiable by verifying a chain of previous domain trust versions._</p>

<p>I like that trust is being patented. Digital trust as a patentable concept that Amazon can now delegate if they choose. I’m just fascinated by what concepts are now fair game for patenting, as they enter into the digital realm. Now I’m curious how many physical trust patents might exist. Is the management of trust patented in the physical world in any way? I guess I could see some of the components for determining trust could be patented, but I find the fact that trust, or more specifically trust management is patentable, as a troubling thing.</p>

<p>It’s no secret that I’m anti API patents. I’m rarely convinced of the uniqueness of anything digital, warranting the issuing of a patent by the USPTO. I have to say that in a world where trust is patentable, the environment for suspect behavior will flourish. Pretty much what we are seeing play out on the web on a daily basis. I’m adding this patent to my <a href="http://authentication.apievangelist.com/">API authentication</a> and <a href="http://security.apievangelist.com/">API security</a> research, because it is a component that exists already in these areas, and should be readily available for any provider to execute as they see fit.</p>

<p>I am spending a significant amount of time reading RFCs lately. I find the documents to be very cumbersome to read, but the more you read, the more tolerant you become. When I browse through RFCs I’m always reminded of how little I actually know about the web. In an effort to push forward my education, and maybe yours along the way, I’m going to be cherry picking specific sections of the interesting RFCs I’m digesting here on the blog. <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3205">Today’s RFC is 3205, filed under Best Current Practice”, and is on the use of HTTP as a Substrate</a>.</p>

<p>_Recently there has been widespread interest in using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) [1] as a substrate for other applications- level protocols. Various reasons cited for this interest have included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>familiarity and mindshare,</li>
  <li>compatibility with widely deployed browsers,</li>
  <li>ability to reuse existing servers and client libraries,</li>
  <li>ease of prototyping servers using CGI scripts and similar extension mechanisms, authentication  and SSL or TLS,</li>
  <li>the ability of HTTP to traverse firewalls, and</li>
  <li>cases where a server often needs to support HTTP anyway.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Internet community has a long tradition of protocol reuse, dating back to the use of Telnet as a substrate for FTP and SMTP.  However, the recent interest in layering new protocols over HTTP has raised a number of questions when such use is appropriate, and the proper way to use HTTP in contexts where it is appropriate. Specifically, for a given application that is layered on top of HTTP:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Should the application use a different port than the HTTP default  of 80?</li>
  <li>Should the application use traditional HTTP methods (GET, POST,  etc.) or should it define new methods?</li>
  <li>Should the application use http: URLs or define its own prefix?</li>
  <li>Should the application define its own MIME-types, or use something  that already exists (like registering a new type of MIME-directory structure)?</li>
</ul>

<p>This memo recommends certain design decisions in answer to these  questions.</p>

<p>This memo is intended as advice and recommendation for protocol designers, working groups, implementors, and IESG, rather than as a strict set of rules which must be adhered to in all cases. Accordingly, the capitalized key words defined in RFC 2119, which are intended to indicate conformance to a specification, are not used in this memo._</p>

<p>I love the notion of <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3205">HTTP as a substrate</a>. The definition of substrate is “a substance or layer that underlies something, or on which some process occurs, in particular” or also, “the surface or material on or from which an organism lives, grows, or obtains its nourishment”. I also love the notion of providing guidance for this line of thought. There are many things contained in this document I have learned from my time in the space, and included in my storytelling, without much thought regarding where it originated, or how accurate it was. I particularly like the notion of HTTP as a material in which an organism lives, but maybe more of a digital organism, or a bot. A reminder that everything that may take seed, flourish and grow in this environment, might not always be a good thing.</p>

<p>I don’t have any production experience deploying <a href="https://jwt.io/introduction/">JSON Web Tokens (JWT)</a>, but it has been something I’ve been reading up on, and staying in tune with for some time. I often reference JWT as the leading edge for API authentication, but there is one aspect of JWT I think is worth me referencing more often–message integrity. JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.</p>

<p>JWT can not only be used for authentication of both message sender/receiver, it can ensure the message integrity as well, leveraging a digital signature hash value of the message body to ensure the message integrity during transmission. It adds another interesting dimension to the <a href="http://security.apievangelist.com">API security</a> conversation, and while not be applicable in all APIs, I know many that it would make a lot of sense. Many of the networks we use today and applications we depend on today are proxied, creating an environment where message integrity should always come into question, and JWT gives us another tool in our toolbox to help us keep things secure.</p>

<p>I’m working my way through each layer of API operations, looking for aspects of API security that are often obscured, hidden, or just not discussed as they should be. I feel like JWT is definitely one track of API security that has evolved the conversation significantly over the last couple years, and is something that can make a significant impact on the space with just a little more storytelling and education. I’m going to make sure API request and response message integrity is a regular part of my API security storytelling, curriculum, and live talks that I develop.</p>

<p>A topic that keeps coming up in discussions with my partner in crime Audrey Watters (@audreywatters) about our podcast is around the future of labor in an API world. I have not written anything about this, which means I’m still in early stages of any research into this area, but it has come up in conversation, and reflected regularly in my monitoring of the API space, I need to begin working through my ideas in this area. A process that helps me better see what is coming down the API pipes, and fill the gaps in what I do not know.</p>

<p>Audrey has long joked about my API world using a simple phrase: “reducing everything to a transaction”. She says it mostly in jest, but other times I feel like she wields it as the Cassandra she channels. I actually bring up the phrase more than she does, because it is something I regularly find myself working in the service of as the API Evangelist. By taking a pro API stance I am actively working to reduce legacy business, institutional, and government processes down and breaking them down into a variety of individual tasks, or if you see things through a commercial lens, transactions.</p>

<p><strong>Microservices</strong><br />
A microservices philosophy is all about breaking down monoliths into small bite size chunks, so they can be transacted independently, scaled, evolved, and deprecated in isolation. Microservices should do one thing, and do it well (no backtalk). Microservices should do what it does as efficiently as possible, with as few dependencies as possible. Microservices are self-contained, self-sufficient, and have everything they need to get the job done under a single definition of a service (a real John Wayne of compute). And of course, everything has an API. Microservices aren’t just about decoupling the technology, they are are about decoupling the business, and the politics of doing business within SMB, SME, enterprises, institutions, and government agencies–the philosophy for reducing everything to a transaction.</p>

<p><strong>Containers</strong><br />
A microservice way of thinking about software that is born in the clouds, a bi-product of virtualization and API-ization of IT resources like storage and compute. In the last decade, as IT services moved from the basement of companies into the cloud, a new approach to delivering the compute, storage, and scalability needed to drive this new microservices way of doing business emerged that was called containers. In 2017 businesses are being containerized. The enterprise monolith is being reduced down to small transactions, putting the technology, business, and politics of each business transaction into a single container, for more efficient development, deployment, scaling, and management. Containers are the vehicle moving the microservices philosophy forward–the virtualized embodiment of reducing everything to a transaction.</p>

<p><strong>Serverless</strong><br />
Alongside a microservice way of life, driven by containerization, is another technological trend (undertow) called serverless. With the entire IT backend being virtualized in the cloud, the notion of the server is disappearing, lightening the load for developers in their quest for containerizing everything, turning the business landscape into microservices, than can be distilled down to a single, simple, executable, scalable function. Serverless is the codified conveyor belt of transactions rolling by each worker on the factory floor. Each slot on a containerized, serverless, microservices factory floor possessing a single script or function, allowing each transaction to be executed,  and replicated allowing it to be applied over and over, scaled, and fixed as needed. Serverless is the big metal stamping station along a multidimensional digital factory assembly line.</p>

<p><strong>DevOps</strong><br />
Living in microservices land, with everything neatly in containers, being assembled, developed, and wrenched on by developers, you are increasingly given more (or less) control over the conveyor belt that rolls by you on the factory floor. As a transaction developer you are given the ability to change direction of your conveyor belt, speed things up, apply one or many metal stamp templates, and orchestrate as much, or as little of the transaction supply chain as you can keep up with (meritocracy 5.3.4). Some transaction developers will be closer to the title of architect, understanding larger portions of the transaction supply chain, while most will be specialized, applying one or a handful of transaction templates, with no training or awareness of the bigger picture, simply pulling the Devops knobs and levers within their reach.</p>

<p><strong>Blockchain</strong><br />
Another trend (undertow) that has been building for sometime, that I have managed to ignore as much as I can (until recently) is the blockchain. Blockchain and the emergence of API driven smart contracts has brought the technology front and center for me, making it something i can ignore, as I see signs that each API transaction will soon be put in the blockchain. The blockchain appears to becoming the decentralized (ha!) and encrypted manifestation of what many of us has been calling the API contract for years. <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/introducing-enterprise-smart-contracts/">I am seeing movements from all the major cloud providers</a>, and lesser known API providers to <a href="https://medium.com/@kevinsimper/serverless-is-the-jump-before-ethereum-smart-contracts-121d92e67426">ensure that all transactions are put into the blockchain</a>, providing a record of everything that flows through API pipes, and has been decoupled, containerized, rendered as serverless, and available for devops orchestration.</p>

<p><strong>Ignorance of Labor</strong><br />
I am not an expert in labor, unions, and markets. Hell, I still haven’t even finished my Marx and Engels Reader. But, I know enough to be able to see that us developers are fucking ourselves right now. Our quest to reduce everything to a transaction, decouple all the things, and containerize and render them serverless makes us the perfect tool(s) for some pretty dark working conditions. Sure, some of us will have the bigger picture, and make a decent living being architects. The rest of us will become digital assembly line workers, stamping, maintaining a handful of services that do one thing and do it well. We will be completely unaware of dependencies, or how things are orchestrated, barely able to stay afloat, pay the bills, leaving us thankful for any transactions sent our way.</p>

<p>Think of this frontline in terms of Amazon Mechanical Turk + API + Microservices + Containers + Serverless + Blockhain. There is a reason young developers make for good soldiers on this front line. Lack of awareness of history. Lack of awareness of labor. Makes great digital factory floor workers, stamping transactions for reuse elsewhere in the digital assembly line process. This model will fit well with current Silicon Valley culture. There will still be enough opportunity in this environment for architects and cybersecurity theater conductors to make money, exploit, and generate wealth. Without the defense of unions, government or institutions, us developers will find ourselves reduced to transactions, stamping out other transactions on the digital assembly line floor.</p>

<p>I know you think your savvy. I used to think this too. Then after having the rug pulled out from under me, and the game changed around me by business partners, investors, and other actors who were playing a game I’m not familiar with, I have become more critical. You can look around the landscape right now and see numerous ways in which power has set its sights on the web, and completely distorting any notion of the web being democratic, open, inclusive, or safe environment. Why do us developers think it will be any different wit us? Oh yeah, privilege.</p>

<p>I have my own URL shortener for API Evangelist called apis.how. I use it to track the click through rates for some of my research projects, and partner sponsorships. I’ve had the URL shortener in operation for about two years now, and I still do not have any type of UI for it, relying 100% on Postman for adding, searching, and managing the URLs I am shortening, and tracking on.</p>

<p>My URL shortener just hasn’t raised to a level of priority where I’ll invest any time into an administrative interface, or dashboard for my URL shortener. I used Bitly and Google for a while, but I really just needed a simple shortening with basic counts, nothing more. When I bought the domain I launched a handful of API endpoints to support, allowing me to add, update, search, and remove URLs, as well as track the click throughs, and query how many clicks a link received for each mont. I can easily accomplish all of this through the Postman interface, making basic calls to my simple API–no over-engineering necessary.</p>

<p>I have been considering running a daily job that pulls view counts for URLs and publishing to Github as YAML, where I can drive a simple visualization, but honestly I’m not that numbers oriented. I like what API clients like <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/">Postman</a> and <a href="https://restlet.com/">Restlet</a> provide. Even though I’m equipped to make calls using JavaScript, PHP, or CURL, I prefer just accessing via my web client–no coding necessary. I wouldn’t manage all my systems in this way, but for really basic ones like my URL shortener, I’m not sure I will ever actually evolve it beyond just being a simple API.</p>

<p>I’m rarely surprised by, but still often caught off guard by the subtle ways in which power asserts itself when faced with change the introduced by API projects. In my 30 years as a database professional I’ve seen numerous overt, covert, and subversive ways in which existing holders of power (data), but I often still get blindsided by the creative, and subtle ways in which folks defend what they already have, and work to keep things from changing.</p>

<p>While doing unfunded work to define industry level API specifications, and help move forward the API conversation in multiple industries, I’ve been encountering two pockets of friction I want to understand better, so I can develop some sort of grease, that might make things smoother. There are two main pockets of practitioners in this setting, implementors (those you publish an API), and vendors (those who currently sell solutions to implementors). My role in any industry as the API Evangelist is to help ultimately define and showcase healthy, common API definitions, that can be reused across the API lifecycle–from design to deprecation.</p>

<p><strong>The Vendor Question</strong>
Trying to understand the culture, and motivations of any SMB, SME, or enterprise is often a full time job I do not have the time or resources for. I work pretty hard to understand any of the key players in any industry being touched by APIs, but will still have much I need to learn. One thing I do know, is that I should never take a company for face value, because behind the mask there is always much more going on. Honestly, APIs are actually a pretty good barometer of what is going on behind the scenes, something I don’t think some API providers fully grasp before they decide to jump into the API game.</p>

<p>The most obvious thing a vendor in an industry will do is ignore you. When approached about participating in discussions around a common API definition, they’ll just not return your emails, tweets, and other front door solicitations–this is fine, many are busy, or just very confident in their place within an industry. Next, you’ll get the folks who will join you at the table in some capacity, or other. Most are busy, and will have limited time–that is understood. What I am trying to understand is their behavior once they are at the table, because I feel that many of them aren’t actually at the table to participate. They are at the table to be present, influence the discussion, which often times might mean keeping the discussion from moving forward at all.</p>

<p>As someone who does not have a job, and regular paycheck, I’m fascinated by the amount of time that can be wasted by SMB, SME, and enterprise folks when you are trying to talk about a common API definition. I don’t care if you have a machine readable way to define the conversation using OpenAPI for the API, and JSON schema for the schema, folks will find a way to dance around any clear process and framework. The first hurdle is always learning to speak OpenAPI and JSON schema, and helping vendors become fluent in OpenAPI, allowing conversations be anchored to specific APIs, paths, headers, parameters, responses, and schema. This is no guarantee of forward motion, but it does help keep things focused, and potentially productive around establishment of a common API contract.</p>

<p>With vendors, all roads lead to their products, and their solutions. The question is always how we can best get them to invest in shared public API infrastructure, over routing all conversations to their platform, on their roads. Money and investment is always the quickest way I see vendors take control of conversations, and route things in their direction. Let’s work on this project, or this infrastructure involving a specific implementation of our choosing, and we’ll move forward the API standards conversation in those terms, and within the context of our choosing and funding. Sure, some environments might actually be conducive to moving things forward, but I think we need to think deeply about how we decouple the technology, business, and politics of all vendor project engagements.</p>

<p>All vendors are suspect. Even the nice ones. Honestly, those are the ones that worry me the most. I’ve had way more time of mine wasted by nice vendors, talking about participating, putting meetings in the calendar, and collaborating on press releases that never see the light of day, to know better. Honestly, the opinionated, straight forward vendors are the ones I worry about least–you know where they stand. From my view all vendor projects need to have a defined (de)coupling from specific vendor interests and the standards interest. Keeping this API is the best way do this, as the central API specification will have an OpenAPI and JSON schema, as will the individual project. Using OpenAPI as a contract for vendor engagement provides a nice scaffolding for this (de)coupling, keeping any billable hours spent measured by commits to the OpenAPI, JSON Schema, or actually now that I’m thinking about it an APIs.json or other discovery document.</p>

<p>Now I am getting to the goal of writing this post. Each vendor related project will begin and end as a Github repository with an OpenAPI, JSON Schema, and APIs.json as the central definition, and contract. This will be the central (de)coupling business contract, even if the vendor, and other parties are not fluent in OpenAPI, JSON Schema, or APIs.json. I will maintain the contract, and communicate it out in all proposals, meetings, and project documentation, encouraging awareness and literacy around all three specifications when possible. With API definitions published to Github as central contract, it regularly allows me to assess progress made, and measure the effectiveness of individual projects, making decision on how to fund and move forward, as well as cut them loose when they are no longer making sense.</p>

<p><strong>The Implementors Dilemma</strong>
Individual API implementations are an entirely different beast from vendors, and while they may live within the tractor beam of one or many vendors, they often have their own silos, resource deficient, and organizational isolation that drives it’s quest to retain power. In each of these industries I am approaching things from a position of harmonization, standardization, interoperability, and reuse, which is often out of view of individual implementors. Individual industry level API implementations want to be successful in their context, and often want the benefits of harmonization, standardization, interoperability, and reuse that are being suggested, but rarely want to, or have the time to do the had work needed to make necessary changes. This will manifest itself in many different ways when you are trying to talk about API standards, something that is often in response to, or driven by the power motivations of vendors who have their ear.</p>

<p>Literacy and awareness are the biggest challenges with individual implementors. Whether federal government, city government, higher educational institutions, or small regional nonprofit organizations, almost every group I come across is underfunded, and under-resourced when it comes to their IT needs, and the delivery of data and content systems. Many folks I meet are well meaning, but lack the skills and training necessary to deliver scalable IT systems, having often landed in their jobs by accident, and being in the right place at the right time. Some are aware of these deficiencies, but lack time and resources they need to get the training they need, while others are completely unaware, and in denial, often taking a very hostile and combative approach when it comes to new ideas, even if they may seem like common practice in the wider API sector.</p>

<p>The majority of organizations I come across are not ready for API. They are not confident in what they know, and what they do not know. They want to share data and information, but often aren’t setup technically or culturally to share data and information. Implementors want to be able to leverage data from other implementations, and reuse open source code, services, and tooling, but will rarely want to do the hard work required to reciprocate in these environments. While well meaning, many are so far behind because of many decisions they’ve made along the way to stay behind, and will require a significant amount of training and investment to bring into alignment with industry-wide standards. Some will never be brought into alignment, and should be replaced–whether they are well meaning or not.</p>

<p>Similar to all vendors, each individual API implementation should have it’s own contract and repository. If an OpenAPI cannot be mocked for an implementation, bringing into focus existing schema, and access requirements for an individual API implementation, it is unlikely that an implementation will ever be moved forward. OpenAPI, JSON Schema, and APIs.json help quantify:</p>

<ul>
  <li>API Operations - What APIs are there, as well as all supporting resources like documentation, registration, terms of service, and other things that govern doing business online today.</li>
  <li>API Access - What are the technical details for each API path, parameter, and schema, providing a detailed list of what each access request and response involves.</li>
  <li>Data &amp; Content - What data and content is being made available, often reflecting backend databases and other systems, but ideally reflects common schema that can be reused in other systems.</li>
</ul>

<p>If an organization can not come together have a constructive conversation around access to data, content as part of a new approach to working with external groups via an API operations, it is unlikely and individual implementation will ever be viable. OpenAPI, JSON Schema, and APIs.json can all exist as YAML documents, which is (should be) plain language, no code, brackets or otherwise, allowing business and technical groups to both participate. Similar to vendor implementations, I will be providing oversight of each Github repository, and central project OpenAPI, JSON Schema, and APIs.json index, but ideally each individual implementation becomes the keeper of the contract for each of their projects, requiring only minimal engagement from other implementations, vendors, or at the standards level of the discussion.</p>

<p><strong>Bringing This Home For Next Round Of Conversations</strong>
Ok, I actually have to invest in the next rounds of these industry level API discussions. I think I’ve settled in on my Github repo managed, OpenAPI, and APIs.json governance of these large number of relationships I need to engage in, manage, and measure. I’ve been blindsided by several conversations at the implementation, vendor, and industry levels, across city and federal government levels, and small, medium, and larger corporations lately. My goal in this post is to help me mitigate damage in future conversations, and keep myself moving along at a faster pace, with least amount of friction on my end as I can. When dealing with so many personalities, as I am across a handful of industries, it is something can be very exhausting if I do not find a way to insulate myself.</p>

<p>Each vendor and implementation involved with the defining of an industry API standard with live as a Github repository. Being able to sign up for a Github account, and participate in issues is a minimum entry fee. Not that they’ll be excluded. They’ll just be identified as making a choice to stay behind. The presence and robustness of an APIs.json will be the next layer of definition, providing essential links to API operations for either the vendor or the implementation. In my opinion, this is always a great way to size up a company, organization, institutions, and government agency. Similar to how you can size up an organization by their web, and social media presence, if they don’t have an existing API or open data effort already, there are other deficiencies right around the corner, or behind the firewall.</p>

<p>Next, the presence and evolution of a coherent OpenAPI and JSON Schema will bring into focus the viability of a vendor partnership, and individual implementation viability. If an OpenAPI can be established and moved forward, there is potential. If there hasn’t been commits in months, and difference between commits productive, with a healthy amount of issue activity, I’m guessing a vendor relationship, or individual API implementation needs further assessment regarding its viability, and sustainability. Of course, any final decisions are made by a human (me), as everything I’m discussing here operates under the API Evangelist, and Adopta.Agency network of API research projects.</p>

<p>The majority of my time as API Evangelist is spent researching the technology, business, and politics of API operations across ALL industries. I’ve created my Adopta.Agency domain to help me manage my investment in common API definitions, schema, and actual implementations of public open data and API projects. I’m trying to establish an approach to help define common OpenAPI, JSON Schema, and APIs.json for a number of industries, that allows me to move forward a number of conversations, with the least amount of friction, and impact on me. I don’t enjoy getting sucked into politics, and prefer staying at the highest level possible when it comes to helping influence what is API today–something that is impacting a significant portion of our world, not just the tech sector.</p>

<p>I’ve been tracking on many different API industries using small data driven Github repositories for three years now. <a href="http://theapistack.com">I track on over 1500 APIs using my API Stack research</a>, which has morphed into what I call the Stack.Network, where I profile specific industries or sectors of how we do business online today–companies like <a href="http://amazon.web.services.stack.network/">Amazon</a>, <a href="http://microsoft.stack.network/">Microsoft</a>, and <a href="http://google.stack.network/">Google</a>. My API Stack research is all about identifying common patterns across individual API implementations, aggregating them into over 1500 individual building blocks that contribute to my definition of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/api-lifecycle/">the almost 100 stops along a modern API lifecycle</a>. Each of my stacks tends to represent an industry like SMS, or news, but I also have individual company stacks like <a href="http://facebook.stack.network/">Facebook</a>, or possibly even <a href="http://gsa.index.apievangelist.com/">the federal government like with the General Services Administration (GSA)</a>. Each of these projects have an OpenAPI, JSON Schema, and APIs.json core, which gives me a distilled down definition of each stack for inclusion across my research.</p>

<p>I’m looking to define I want to expand my existing approach to quantifying the world of APIs to include specific APIs, schema, implementations, and collections, and open it up for collaboration and discussion with a variety of vendors who may serve multiple industries, as well as specific implementations within an industry. Honestly, nothing really changes for me in all of this, except that I will be encouraging vendors and implementations to at least participate, and ideally move forward their own OpenAPI, JSON Schema, and <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>. I’m also looking to encourage them to be a little more Github fluent when it comes to defining a common industry API definition and schema. I see Github as just another social network like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Pinterest, except the actions taken often revolve around code, and machine readable templates, instead of messages, images, video, and other common social building blocks.</p>

<p>Ok, phew. If you are still reading this, you should probably develop a hobby. I’m writing this to help me get my ducks in order. If it makes sense to you, and helps you in your API journey–awesome! I feel I have to regularly write about the feels I get in my working as the API Evangelist. It is about me talking through what I’m seeing, and finding a way forward. The scope at which some of these API conversations are occurring at can be dizzying, and if I don’t step back from time to time, and just work through my feels, they tend to pile up and I stumble more. This post help me come around full circle to realize some of the new projects I’ve been taking on are actually just an extension of what I’ve already been doing as I map the world of APIs, I’m just turning up the intimacy level on some of the vendor and implementation level relationships. However I’ve done a pretty good job of building an insulator between me an the space, I just need to keep doing what I’ve been doing for the last seven years, and confidently push some more of these common API definitions, schema, and collections out the door.</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://thebioscope.net/2010/11/23/tied-to-the-tracks/"><img src="https://bioscopic.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/barneyoldfield.jpg" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://gcn.com/Articles/2017/07/06/NYPD-Palantir-crime-analysis.aspx">I was reading about the difficulties the City of New York was having when it comes to migrating off of the Palantir platform</a>, while also reading about the latest cybersecurity drama involving ransomware. I’m spending a lot of time studying cybersecurity lately, partly because they involve APIs, but mostly because it is something that is impacting every aspect of our lives, including our democracy, education, and healthcare. One thing I notice on the cybersecurity stage, is that everything is a much more extreme, intense, representation of what is going on in the mainstream tech industry.</p>

<p>Ransomware is software that gets installed on your desktop or servers and locks up all your data until you pay the software developer (implementor) a ransom. Ransomware is just a much faster moving version of what many of us in the software industry call vendor lock-in. This is what you are seeing with Palantir, and the City of New York. What tech companies do is get you to install their software on your desktop or servers, or convince you to upload all your data into the cloud, and use their software. This is business 101 in the tech industry. You either develop cloud-based software, something that runs on-premise, or you are a mix of both. Ideally, your customers become dependent on you, and they keep paying your monthly, quarterly, or annual subscriptions (cough cough ransom).</p>

<p>Here is where the crafty API part of the scheme comes in. Software providers can also make APIs that allow your desktop and server to integrate with their cloud solutions, allowing for much deeper integration of data, content, and algorithms. The presence of APIs SHOULD also mean that you can more easily get your data, content, and algorithms back, or have kept in sync the whole time, so that when you are ready to move on, you don’t have a problem getting your data and content back. The problem is, that APIs “CAN” enable this, but in many situations providers do not actually give you complete access to your data, content, or algorithms via API, and enable the true data portability and sync features you need to continue doing business without them.</p>

<p>This is vendor lock-in. It is a much friendlier, slower moving version of ransomware. As a software vendor you want your software to be baked in to a customers operations so they are dependent on you. How aggressively you pursue this, and how much you limit data portability, and interoperability, dictates whether you are just doing business as usual, or engaging in vendor lock-in. One thing I’m hopeful for in all of this, are the vendors who see transparency, observability, interoperability, and portability of not just the technical, but also the business and politics of delivering technology as a legitimate competitive advantage. This means that they will always be able to out maneuver, and stay ahead of software vendors who practice vendor lock-in and ransomware, whether of the slow or fast moving variety.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/08/07/api-industry-standards-negotiation-by-media-type/">API Industry Standards Negotiation By Media Type</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">07 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-services.png" align="right" width="30%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I am trying to help push forward the conversation around <a href="https://openreferral.github.io/api-specification/definition/">the API definition for the Human Services Data Specification (HSDS)</a> in a constructive way amidst a number of competing interests. I was handed a schema for sharing data about about organizations, locations, and services in a CSV format. I took this schema and exposed it with a set of API paths, keeping the flat file structure in tact, making no assumptions around how someone would need to access the data. I simply added the ability to get HSDS over the web as JSON–I would like to extend to be HTML, CSV, JSON, and XML, reaching as wide as possible audience with the basic implementation.</p>

<p>As we move forward discussions around HSDS and HSDA I’m looking to use media types to help separate the different types of access people are looking for using media types. I don’t want to leave folks who only have basic CSV export or import capabilities behind, but still wanted to provide guidance for exchanging HSDA over the web. To help organize higher levels of demand on the HSDS schema I’m going to break out into some specialized media types as well as the default set:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Human Services Data Specification (HSDS)</strong> - text/csv - Keeping data package basic, spreadsheet friendly, yet portable and exchangeable.</li>
  <li><strong>Human Services Data API (HSDA)</strong> - application/json and text/xml, text/csv, and text/html - Governing access at the most basic level, keeping true to schema, but allowing for content negotiation over the web.</li>
  <li><strong>Human Services Data API (HSDA) Hypermedia</strong> - (application/hal+json and application/hal+xml)  - Allowing for more comprehensive responses to HSDA requests, addressing searching, filtering, pagination, and relationship linking between any HSDS returend.</li>
  <li><strong>Human Services Data API (HSDA) Bulk</strong> - (application/vnd.hsda.bulk) - Focusing on heavy system to system bulk transfers, and eventually syncing, backups, archives, and migrations. Dealing with the industrial levels of HSDA operations.</li>
  <li><strong>Human Services Data API (HSDA) Federated</strong> - (application/vnd.hsda.federated) - Allowing for a federated HSDA implementation that allows for the moderation of all POST, PUT, and DELETE by a distributed set of partners. Might also accompany the bulk system where partners can enable sync or bulk extraction for use in their own implementations.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am working to define an industry level API standard. I am not operating an individual API implementation (well I do have several demos), so media types allows me to enable each vendor, or implementation to negotiate the type of content they desire. If they are interested developing single page applications or conversational interfaces they can offer up the hypermedia implementation. If they are system administrators and looking to load up large datasets, or extract large datasets, they can work within the HSDA Bulk realm. In the end I can see any one of these APIs being deployed in isolation, as well as all four of them living side by side, driving a single HSDS/A compliant platform.</p>

<p>This is all preliminary thought. All I have currently is HSDS, and HSDA returning JSON. I’m just brainstorming about what possible paths there are forward, and what I think the solution involves content negotiation, at the vendor, implementation, and consumption levels. Content type negotiation seems to provide a great way to break up and separate concerns, keeping simple things simple, and some of the more robust integrations segregated, while still working in concert. I’m always impressed by the meaningful impact something like content type has had on the web API design conversation, and always surprised when I learn new approaches to leveraging the content type header as part of API operations.</p>

<p><a href="https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/bkyan/StyleThief">I was playing around with the Style Thief, an image transfer API from Algorithmia</a>, and I noticed the citation for the algorithm behind. The API is an adaptation of <a href="https://github.com/anishathalye/neural-style/">Anish Athalye’s Neural Style Transfer</a>, and I thought the algorithmic citation of where the work was derived from was an interesting thing to take note of for my machine learning API research.</p>

<p>I noticed on Algorithmia’s page there was <a href="http://www.bibtex.org/">a Bibtex citation</a>, which referenced the author, and project Github repository:</p>

<p>@misc{athalye2015neuralstyle,<br />
   author = {Anish Athalye},<br />
   title = {Neural Style},<br />
   year = {2015},<br />

<p>This provides an interesting way to address citation in not just machine learning, but with open source driving algorithmic APIs in general. It gives me food for thought when it comes to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/12/02/what-licensing-should-i-be-considering-when-i-take-open-source-software-and-offer-up-as-an-api/">what licensing I should be considering when wrapping open source software with an API</a>. I’ve been <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/08/04/including-api-dependencies-within-api-definition/">thinking about dependencies a lot lately when it comes to APIs and their definitions</a>, and I’d consider citation or attribution to be in a similar category. I guess rather then technical dependency, it is more in the business and legal dependency category.</p>

<p>Similar to how Pivio allows you to reference dependencies for your microservices, I’m thinking that <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>, or some other format like Bibtext could provide a machine readable citation, that could be indexed as part of an <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json index</a>. Allowing us API designers, architect, and providers to provide proper citation for where our work is derived. These aren’t just technical dependencies, but also business and political dependencies, that we should ensuring are present with each API we deploy, providing an observable provenance of where ideas come from, and a honest look at how we build on the work of each other.</p>

<p>I’m neck deep into my assessment of the world of API security this week, a process which always yields plenty of random thoughts, which end up becoming stories here on the blog. One aspect of API security I keep coming across in this research is the concept of API rate limiting as being security. This is something I’ve long attributed with API management service providers making their mark on the API landscape, but as I dig deeper I think there is more to this notion of what API security is (or isn’t). I think it has more to do with API providers, than companies selling their warez to these API providers.</p>

<p>The API management service providers have definitely set the tone for API security conversation(good), by standing up a gateway, and providing tools for limiting what access is available–I think many data, content, and algorithmic stewards are very narrowly focus on security being ONLY about limiting access to their valuable resources. Many folks I come across see their resources as valuable, when they begin doing APIs they have a significant amount of concern around putting their resources on the Internet, and once you secure and begin rate limiting things, all security concerns appear to have been dealt with. Competitors, and others just can’t get at your valuable resources, they have to come through the gate–API security done.</p>

<p>Many API providers I encounter have unrealistic views of the value of their data, content, and algorithms, and when you match this with their unrealistic views about how much others want access to this valuable content you end up with a vacuum which allows for some very narrow views of what API security is. To help support this type of thinking, I feel like the awareness generated from API management is often focused on generating revenue, and not always about understanding API abuse, and is also something can create blindspots when it comes to database, server, and DNS level logging and layers where security threats emerge. I’m assuming folks often feel comfortable that the API management layer is sufficiently securing things by rate limiting, and we can see all traffic through the analytics dashboard. I’m feeling that this one of the reasons folks aren’t looking up at the bigger API security picture.</p>

<p>From what I’m seeing, assumptions that the API management layer is securing things can leave blind spots in other areas like DNS, threat information gathering, aggregation, collaboration, and sharing. I’ve come across API providers who are focused in on API management, but don’t have visibility at the database, server, container, and web server logging levels, and are only paying attention to what their API management dashboard provides access to. I feel like API management opened up a new found awareness for API provides, something that has evolved and spread to <a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com/">API monitoring</a>, <a href="http://testing.apievangelist.com/">API testing</a>, and <a href="http://performance.apievangelist.com/">API performance</a>. I feel like the next wave of awareness will be in the area of API security. I’m just trying to explore ways that I can help my readers and clients better understand how to expand their vision of API security beyond their current field of vision.</p>

        <p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/08/03/microservice-discovery-using-pivio/">I was learning about Pivio, a discovery specification for microservices the other day, and found their focus on microservice dependency to be pretty interesting</a>. API dependencies has been an area I have found myself increasingly thinking about, as well as tracking on in my API research. I’m pretty close to publishing a project dedicated to understanding API, and microservices dependencies, which would overlap with containers, serverless, and other aspects of the API lifecycle that are all about breaking down the monolith.</p>

<p>Each service definition using Pivio has a depends_on object, which allows for defining both internal and external service dependencies. Here is a snippet from a sample Pivio document to help articulate this interesting feature:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/728a92155bc507a526182b3b767a73d1.js"></script>

<p>This is where you can start connecting the cords between all of your services, something that is applicable to any APIs, whether you’ve drank the microservices kool-aid or not. I find it interesting that Pivio has internal, and external. I’d love to see an OpenAPI linked off each of the services it depends on. I also am fascinated with the first question for external, why? What a great first question for any dependency–it should also be available for internal services as well. Every API provider should be inquiring why a dependency exist whenever possible, and having it quantified in this way just opens up more chances for this question to get asked.</p>

<p>Seeing dependencies quantified in Pivio makes me happy. It has been something I’ve wanted to reflect in <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> for some time now. Currently, I do not know of any way to quantify the relationship between APIs, and Pivio provides a glimpse at one possible way we might be able to map this world out. <a href="http://www.cytoscape.org/">I have been learning more about Cytoscape, a network data integration, analysis, and visualization framework</a>. Having a machine readable API dependencies definition would allow me to create a network visualization of any API or microservices discovery catalog. It wouldn’t take much work at all to map out API and microservice dependencies at the internal and external levels, further helping to quantify the platforms we operate.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/mining-machine-learning.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>
<p>I spend a lot of time trying out new APIs, working to understand what it is they do, or do not do. I have a pretty robust way of looking at APIs, profiling the company, and the APIs they offer, but when I’m wading through the marketing content, API documentation, and other resources, I am regularly stumped by the language that is used to describe what an API does. Honestly, this problem isn’t exclusive to machine learning APIs, but with the recent explosion in artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, cognitive and other types of algorithmic voodoo, the words being used seem to have gone to entirely new levels.</p>

<p>I am interested in understanding what it is an API does. I want to go from zero to understanding in 2.34 seconds. I don’t want to wade through marketing, and documentation to understand what an API does. I want to find simple, concise language that properly describes an API. In the world of artificial intelligence, this can be difficult to do, and is something that varies from provider to provider. Some machine learning API providers are better at describing what they do, while others seem to prefer hype, and fluff when it comes to explaining what is actually possible.</p>

<p>As I continue my work profiling <a href="http://amazon.web.services.stack.network/">Amazon</a>, <a href="http://microsoft.stack.network/">Microsoft</a>, and <a href="http://google.stack.network/">Google APIs</a> I want to develop an approach to helping me separate what an API does, and what a provider says it does. I am going to continue profiling each API <a href="https://www.openapis.org/">using OpenAPI</a>, and labeling them with a common set of tags I’m using to quantify what machine learning APIs actually do. As I’m doing this I also decided to add an extra tag field called x-hype-tags, which gives me a way to track each of the additional words I found in the marketing and documentation, that I may not be actually using to describe what the API does–maintaining much of the API providers intent.</p>

<p>One thing that contributes to the confusion of what is machine learning is that, very similar to APIs, it can be almost anything. While packaged in many different ways, most of the major machine learning providers have a machine learning engine for training and executing models, as well as some ready to go models that accomplish some common ML tasks for developers. Here are the primary machine learning engines I’ve been profiling out of the major cloud providers:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/"><strong>Amazon Machine Learning</strong></a> - Amazon Machine Learning is a service that makes it easy for developers of all skill levels to use machine learning technology.</li>
  <li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/ml/"><strong>Google Machine Learning</strong></a> - Google Cloud Machine Learning Engine is a managed service that enables you to easily build machine learning models that work on any type of data, of any size</li>
  <li><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning/"><strong>Azure Machine Learning</strong></a> - A fully-managed cloud service that enables you to easily build, deploy, and share predictive analytics solutions.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am going to be profiling these engines in their own way, but before I understand the infinite possibilities, I want to better understand the finite possibilities with each of these machine learning platforms. To help me develop a way of tagging, and quantifying what APIs do, and the hype around them I took a single type of machine learning API from each of these providers, and augmented their OpenAPI with more descriptive tagging.</p>

<p>To begin, I started with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/?hp=tile&amp;so-exp=below">Amazon’s Rekognition API</a>, crafting a basic OpenAPI that outlines the technical details of each possible API request and response, with the added tagging describing what the API does:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/a5b721d555e92aa81cf386a6f85c8e09.js"></script>

<p>Then I went through <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/computer-vision/">Azure’s Computer Vision</a>, crafting a basic OpenAPI that outlines the technical details of each possible API request and response, with the added tagging describing what the API does:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/cc69c6f6a25cbe6ae021941e45fb2f31.js"></script>

<p>Then last I look at <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/">Google’s Cloud Vision API</a>, crafting a basic OpenAPI that outlines the technical details of each possible API request and response, with the added tagging describing what the API does:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/a559ae524f321167d708e229c9792e23.js"></script>

<p>These OpenAPIs aren’t 100% complete. I’m more concerned with developing the tagging schema for use across many APIs, than I am with the perfect OpenAPI. I’ll publish them to Github and continue to evolve, polish, and work to make each OpenAPI as complete as possible. I’m looking to settle in on a schema, before I got to work adding the extra x-hype-tags to additional OpenAPIs, pushing beyond what OpenAPI 2.0 dictates when it comes to API tagging. I’ll use the primary tags for each OpenAPI as the distilled down categorization of what each ML API does, while the x-hype-tags will give me a summary of what is used in the marketing copy, and the API documentation for each ML API provider.</p>

<p>It is important to me that I can quickly pull up APIs that accomplish specific business tasks–this requires each API to be tagged well. I also want to be able to apply some sort of hype score to each API, which reflects the number of adjectives and buzzwords in use in marketing and documentation. I feel these x-hype-tags reflect the hype in ML API space, and the tags reflect the realities of what ML APIs are actually capable of doing. When I profile new ML APIs I will be adding any word that catches my eye to the x-hype-tags, but I will be thinking about more deeply, and more carefully evolving the core set of more meaningful APIs I am using to categorize the ML APIs I track on.</p>

<p>Once I profile Amazon, Microsoft’s, and Google’s ML APIs in this way I am going to go through <a href="http://algorithmia.com">Algorithmia</a>, and other leading ML API providers and profiling their APIs, adding to both my core machine learning tagging vocabulary, as well as my machine learning hype tagging dictionary. Then I’ll step back a little and think about the bigger picture of the words we are choosing to describe our ML APIs. I am looking to develop a better way to be cataloging the types of ML APIs out there, and understand the language API providers are choosing to use when they describe what it is that they deliver. We need to be able to make sense of the ML APIs we already have, as well as each of the upcoming waves of AI and ML voodoo that is being developed right now, and due to be unleashed on the world in coming years.</p>

<p>I’m continuing <a href="http://ipaas.apievangelist.com">my integration platform as a service (iPaaS) research</a>, understanding <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/08/02/making-sure-your-api-service-connects-to-other-stops-along-lifecycle/">how API providers are quickly integration with other platform</a>, I am also looking into how API service providers are opening up their services to the entire API lifecycle. I’m seeing API service provides offer up a default set of integrations with other platforms, ad in some cases using Zapier by default–opening up 750+ other API driven platforms pretty quickly. Another dimension of this that I’m tracking on is when API service providers offer up plugin infrastructure, allowing other platforms to develop plug and play integrations that any platform user can take advantage of.</p>

<p>You can see this in action over at my partner Tyk, who has <a href="https://tyk.io/features/extend-tyk/">a nice set of plugins for their API management solution</a>. They start with three language focused middleware plugins allowing you to write scripts in Java, Lua, and JavaScript. Then they offer two gRPC plugins, which might be another post all by itself. While very similar to the iPaaS, or custom integration solution I’ve seen from other API providers, I’m going to be categorizing plugin approaches to integration like this separately, because it invites developers to come develop integrations as plugin–something that is very API in my book.</p>

<p><a href="http://plugin.apievangelist.com/">I’ve added a separate research area to tune into what types of integrations platforms are introducing via plugin infrastructure</a>. I’m trying to understand how plugins are evolving from being more about platform, browser, and other common forms and becoming more API lifecycle middleware (for lack of better term), like Tyk. I want to be aware of each of their approaches, and how different stops along the API lifecycle are embedding scripting engines, injecting integrated features into operations, and making it part of any continuous integration and deployment workflow(s). Like the other areas of my API lifecycle research, I will stop in from time to time, and understand if plugin API infrastructure is evolving and becoming more of a thing.</p>

        <span class="post-date">03 Aug 2017</span>

<p>I’m spending a significant amount of time learning about machine learning APIs lately. Some of what I’m reading is easy to follow, while most of it is not. A good deal of what I’m reading is technically complex, and more on the documentation side of the conversation. Other stuff I come across is difficult to read, not because it is technical, but because it is more algorithmic marketing magic, and doesn’t really get at what is really going on (or not) under the hood.</p>

<p>If you are in the business of writing marketing copy, documentation, or even the API design itself, please work extra hard to keep things simple and in plain language. I read so much hype, jargon, fluff, and meaningless content about artificial intelligence and machine learning each day, I take pleasure anytime I find simple, concise, and information descriptions of what ML APIs do. In an exploding world of machine learning hype your products will stand out if they are straight up, and avoid the BS, which will pretty quickly turn off the savvy folks to whatever you are peddling.</p>

<p>Really, this advice applies to any API, not just machine learning. It’s just the quantity of hype we are seeing around AI and ML in 2017 is reaching some pretty extreme levels. Following the hype is easy. Writing fluffy content doesn’t take any skills. Writing simple, concise, plain language names, descriptions, and other meta data for artificial intelligence and machine learning APIs takes time, and a significant amount of contemplation regarding the message you want to be sending. The ML APIs I come across that get right to the point, are always the ones that stick around in my mind, and find a place within my research and storytelling.</p>

<p>We are going to continue to see an explosion in the number of algorithmic APIs, delivering across the artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, cognitive, and other magical realms. The APIs that deliver real business value will survive. The ones that have simple intuitive titles, and concise yet informative description that avoid hype and buzz will be the ones that get shared, reused, and ultimately float to the top of the pile and sticking around. I’m spending upwards of 5-10 hours a week looking through AI and ML API descriptions, and when I come across something that is clearly bullshit I don’t hesitate to flag, and push it back to the back warehouses of my research, keeping my time focused on the APIs which I can easily articulate what they do, and will also make sense to my readers.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/08/03/api-discovery-using-json-home/">API Discovery Using JSON Home</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">03 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingham-json-home-06"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/json-home/json-home-widget-example.png" align="right" width="40%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>
<p>I’m have finally dedicated some time to learning more about <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingham-json-home-06">Home Documents for HTTP APIs, or simply JSON Home</a>. I see JSON Home as a nice way to bring together the technical components for an API, very similar to what I’ve been trying to accomplish with APIs.json. One of the biggest differences I see is that I’d say APIs.json was born out of the world of open data and APIs, where JSON Home is born of the web (which actually makes better sense).</p>

<p>I think the JSON Home description captures the specifications origins very well:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Web itself offers one way to address these issues, using links [RFC3986] to navigate between states.  A link-driven application discovers relevant resources at run time, using a shared vocabulary of link relations [RFC5988] and internet media types [RFC6838] to support a “follow your nose” style of interaction - just as a Web browser does to navigate the Web.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>JSON Home provides any potential client with a machine readable set of instructions it can follow, involving one, or many APIs–providing a starting page for APIs which also enables:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Extensibility - Because new server capabilities can be expressed as link relations, new features can be layered in without introducing a new API version; clients will discover them in the home document.</li>
  <li>Evolvability - Likewise, interfaces can change gradually by introducing a new link relation and/or format while still supporting the old ones.</li>
  <li>Customisation - Home documents can be tailored for the client, allowing different classes of service or different client permissions to be exposed naturally.</li>
  <li>Flexible deployment - Since URLs aren’t baked into documentation, the server can choose what URLs to use for a given service.</li>
</ul>

<p>JSON Home, is a home page specification which uses JSON to provide APIs with a a launching point for the interactions they offer, by providing a coherent set links, all wrapped in a single machine readable index. Each JSON begins with a handful of values:</p>

<ul>
  <li>title - a string value indicating the name of the API</li>
  <li>links - an object value, whose member names are link relation types [RFC5988], and values are URLs [RFC3986].</li>
  <li>author - a suitable URL (e.g., mailto: or https:) for the author(s) of the API</li>
  <li>describedBy - a link to documentation for the API</li>
  <li>license - a link to the legal terms for using the API</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you have the general details about the JSON Home API index, you can provide a collection of resource objects possessing links that can be indicated using an href property with a URI value, or template links which uses a URI template. Just like a list of links on a home page, but instead of a browser, it can be used in any client, for a variety of different purposes.</p>

<p>Each of the resources allow for resource hints, which allow clients to obtain relevant information about interacting with a resource beforehand, as a means of optimizing communications, as well as sharing which behaviors will be available for an API. Here are the default hints available for JSON Home:</p>

<ul>
  <li>allow - Hints the HTTP methods that the current client will be able to use to interact with the resource; equivalent to the Allow HTTP response header.</li>
  <li>formats - Hints the representation types that the resource makes available, using the GET method.</li>
  <li>accept-Patch - Hints the PATCH [RFC5789] request formats accepted by the resource for this client; equivalent to the Accept-Patch HTTP response header.</li>
  <li>acceptPost  - Hints the POST request formats accepted by the resource for this client.</li>
  <li>acceptPut - Hints the PUT request formats accepted by the resource for this client.</li>
  <li>acceptRanges - Hints the range-specifiers available to the client  for this resource; equivalent to the Accept-Ranges HTTP response header [RFC7233].</li>
  <li>acceptPrefer - Hints the preferences [RFC7240] supported by the resource.  Note that, as per that specifications, a preference can be ignored by the server.</li>
  <li>docs - Hints the location for human-readable documentation for the relation type of the resource.</li>
  <li>preconditionRequired - Hints that the resource requires state-changing requests (e.g., PUT, PATCH) to include a precondition, as per [RFC7232], to avoid conflicts due to concurrent updates.</li>
  <li>authSchemes- Hints that the resource requires authentication using the HTTP Authentication Framework [RFC7235].</li>
  <li>status -  Hints the status of the resource.</li>
</ul>

<p>These hints provide you with a base set of the most commonly used sets of information, but then there is also a HTTP resource hint registration where all hints are registered. Hints can be added, allowing for the addition of custom defined hints, providing additional information beforehand about what can be expected from a resource link included as part of a JSON Home index. It is a much more sophisticated approach describing the behaviors of links than we included in APIs.json, with the formal hint registry being very useful and well-defined.</p>

<p>I”d say that JSON Home has all the features for defining a single, or collections of APIs, but really reflects its roots in the web, and possesses a heavy focus on enabling action with each link. While this is part of the linking structure of APIs.json, I feel like the detail and the mandate for action around each resource in a JSON Home index is much stronger. I feel like JSON Home is in the same realm as Postman Collections, but when it comes to API discovery. I always feel like a Postman Collection is more transactional than OpenAPI is by default. There is definitely overlap, but Postman Collections always feels one or two step closer to some action being taken than OpenAPI does–I am guessing it is because of it’s client roots, similar to the web roots of JSON Home, and also OpenAPIs roots in documentation.</p>

<p>Ok. Yay! I have Pivio, and now JSON Home both loaded in my brain. I have a feel for what they are trying to accomplish, and have found some interesting layers I hadn’t considered while doing my APIs.json centered API discovery work. Now I can step back, and consider the features of all three of these API discovery formats, establish a rough Venn diagram of their features, and consider how they overlap, and compliment each other. I feel like we are moving towards an important time for API discovery, and with the growing number of APIs available we will see more investment in API discovery specifications, as well as services and tooling that help us with API discovery. I’ll keep working to understand what is going on, establish at least a general understanding of each API discovery specifications, and report back here about what is happening when I can.</p>

<p>I was learning about <a href="http://pivio.io/">the microservices discovery specification Pivio</a>, which is a schema for framing the conversation, but also an uploader, search, and web interface for managing a collection of microservices. I found their use of ElasticSearch as the search engine for their tooling worth thinking about more. When we first launched <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, we created <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a> as the search engine–providing a custom developed public API search engine. I hadn’t thought of using ElasticSearch as an engine for searching APIs.json treated as a JSON document.</p>

<p>Honestly, I have been relying on the Github API as the search engine for my API discovery. Using it to uncover not just APIs.json, but OpenAPI, API Blueprint, and other API specification formats. This works well for public discovery, but I could see ElasticSearch being a quick and dirty way to launch a private or public engine for an API discovery, catalog, directory, or type of collection. I will add ElasticSearch, and other platforms I track on as part of my <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">API deployment research</a> as a <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">API discovery building block</a>, evolving the approaches I’m tracking on.</p>

<p>It is easy to think of API discovery as directories like ProgrammableWeb, or marketplaces like Mashape, and public API search engines like APIs.io–someone else’s discovery vehicle, which you are allowed to drive when you need. However, when you begin to consider other types of API discovery search engines, you realize that a collection of API discovery documents like JSON Home, Pivio, and APIs.json can quickly become your own personal API discovery vehicle. I’m going to write a separate piece on how I use Github as my API discovery engine, then I think I’ll step back and look at other approaches to searching JSON or YAML documents to see if I can find any search engines that might be able to be fine tuned specifically for API discovery.</p>

<p>I’m finally feeling the ground move in the area of <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com/">API discovery</a> a little bit. It is an area I’m perpetually trying to create my own seismic activity with <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, but it always makes me happy to see other folks contributing to the conversation in a significant way. My friend Erik Wilde (<a href="https://twitter.com/dret">@dret</a>) turned me onto <a href="http://pivio.io/">Pivio for microservice discovery</a>, providing a machine readable approach to API discovery that resembles what I’ve been trying to do with APIs.json, but has several very interesting service-centric characteristics.</p>

<p>According to the project website Pivio is a “description in your source code with all the metadata of your service describing itself. This can be as simple as the name, owner and VCS information as well as useful information about runtime environment, used licenses and service dependencies. Pivio is a service registry for humans.” Pivio is a microservice discovery schema, and a web platform for uploading, searching, and viewing your catalog of microservices. It is in alpha version, but already provides a very interesting take on discovery from the microservices perspective.</p>

<p>Pivio begins with a common set of mandatory fields:</p>

<ul>
  <li>id - Unique id in pivio. You can ask the pivio service for a unique id.</li>
  <li>name - The name of the artifact. This is intended for humans.</li>
  <li>short_name - A very brief name for the service.</li>
  <li>type - The type of this artifact. Values could be service, library or mobile_app.</li>
  <li>owner - Which team is responsible for this artifact.</li>
  <li>description - What does this service do?</li>
</ul>

<p>Next Pivio begins to break out some interesting collections:</p>

<ul>
  <li>contact - Who should be contacted if one has a question.</li>
  <li>vcs - Where is the location of source code that runs this service.</li>
  <li>tags - Add tags for organizing each service as part of larger collection.</li>
  <li>lifecycle - In which lifecycle is this component? Only in development, in production or out of service.</li>
  <li>links - All sort of links which might be interesting. Candidates are homepage, buildchain, api docs</li>
</ul>

<p>Then Pivio breaks out some very useful service-focused collections:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Provides - What and where does this artifact provides services? description Should be a human readable description. service_name is the unique identification of the particular interface. port, protocol and transport_protocol are self describing.</li>
  <li>Dependences
    <ul>
      <li>internal - To which other service_name (from provides) services does this service talk?</li>
      <li>external - To which external target needs this artifact to talk to? This is meant to show if 		this service talks to another one outside of your system, like a public API of another service 		provider ‘in the cloud’.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Service Context
    <ul>
      <li>belongs_to_bounded_context - General rule is that every service belongs to a bounded context.</li>
      <li>visibility
  	- private: intended usage is only by the owner
        <ul>
          <li>public: exposes an api for other owners.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Runtime
    <ul>
      <li>cpu - the size of the processor
        <ul>
          <li>ram - how much memory it has</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>disk - what is the size of disk</li>
      <li>host_type - metal, vm, docker</li>
      <li>network_zone - dmz, backend, core, database</li>
      <li>environment - development, test, production</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Software Dependencies - Name, versions, licensing of the software behind each of the services.</li>
  <li>Custom extensions - Have your own keys in this configuration you can simply add your own key word/yaml file.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are overlapping elements of Pivio and API.json, and you can accomplish man similar things with both API discovery formats, but Pivio brings to the table a serious technical view of APIs through a microservice lens. I am really interested in the context, dependencies, and like the runtime, and extension part as well. I think the lifecycle, VCS, and CI/CD aspects of the Pivio schema points to a more meaningful discovery approach in coming years.</p>

<p>Pivio has several supporting open source tools built on the microservices discovery schema which are available from the Github repository at: https://github.com/pivio/:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Client: https://github.com/pivio/pivio-client</li>
  <li>Server: https://github.com/pivio/pivio-server</li>
  <li>Web: https://github.com/pivio/pivio-web</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m not that interested in the client, server, and web applications just yet. I’d like to think more about the context, dependencies, lifecycle, VCS, CI/CD, and the search mechanism they are employing. I’m also going to spend some cycles this week getting up to speed on <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingham-json-home-03">JSON Home</a>, as well as Pivio. I’ve been trying to make some time to learn more about JSON Home lately, but just haven’t had the time. Now that I have Pivo on my desk, I’m kind of forced to make sure I can speak intelligenctly to both of these API discovery specification formats.</p>

<p>It is pretty easy to reference a pivio.yaml discovery document from within an APIs.json, and vice versa. They both allow for extensibility using links. After thinking about JSON Home a little bit, I want to try and establish some sort of Venn diagram of JSON Home, Pivio, and APIs.json to better understand where and when you’d want to use each format, and how they can overlap and work together. I feel like the world of APIs is finally maturing to a point where discovery is a growing pain point, so we are going to see more investment in a variety of approaches to helping make it easier to discover, and maintain rich catalogs of microservices and APIs.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/08/02/understanding-global-api-performance-at-the-multi-cloud-level/">Understanding Global API Performance At The Multi-Cloud Level</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">02 Aug 2017</span>
        <p><a href="http://apimetrics.io/google-location-map/">APIMetrics has a pretty addictive map showing the performance of API calls between multiple cloud providers, spanning many global regions</a>. The cloud location latency map “shows relative performance of a standard, reference GET request made to servers running on all the Google locations and via the Google global load balancer. Calls are made from AWS, Azure, IBM and Google clouds and data is stored for all steps of the API call process and the key percentiles under consideration.”</p>

<p align="center"><a href="http://apimetrics.io/google-location-map/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-metrics/apimetrics-cloud-location-performance-map.png" align="center" width="80%" style="padding: 15px;" /></a></p>

<p>It is interesting to play with the destination of the API calls, changing the region, and visualizing how API calls begin to degrade to different regions. It really sets the stage for how we should start thinking about the deployment, monitoring, and testing of our APIs. Region, by region, getting to know where our consumers are, and making sure APIs are deployed within the cloud infrastructure that delivers the best possible performance. It’s not just testing your APIs in a single location from many locations, it is also rethinking where your APIs are deployed, leveraging a multi-cloud reality and using all the top cloud provider, while also making API deployment by region a priority.</p>

<p>I’m a big fan of what APIMetrics is doing with the API performance visualizations and mapping. However, I think their approach to using HTTPbin is a significant part of this approach to monitoring and visualizing API performance at the multi-cloud level, while also making much of the process and data behind it all public. I want to put some more thought into how they are using HTTPbin behind this approach to multi-cloud API performance monitoring. I feel like there is potential her for applying this beyond just API performance, and think about other testing, security, and critical aspects of reliability and doing business online with APIs today.</p>

<p>After thinking where else this HTTPbin approach to data gathering could be applied, I want to think more about how the data behind APIMetrics cloud location latency map can be injected into other conversations, when it comes where we are deploying APIs, and running our API tests. Eventually I would like to see this type of multi-cloud API performance data alongside data for security and privacy compliance data, and even the regulations of each country as they apply to specific industries. Think about a time when we can deploy our APIs exactly where we want them based upon performance, privacy, security, regulations, and other critical aspects of doing business in the Internet age.</p>
