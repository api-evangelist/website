        <span class="post-date">01 Feb 2011</span>
        According to <a href="http://forrester.com/">Forrester Research</a>, the <a href="http://forrester.com/rb/Research/us_mobile_banking_forecast,_2010_to_2015/q/id/57446/t/2">U.S. mobile banking market has experienced rapid growth in the past three years</a>, more than doubling from 5% of online adults in 2007 to 12% in Q2 2010.
<a href="http://forrester.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/forrester-research-logo.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a>
By 2015, Forrester predicts that one in five US adults will be using mobile banking. Forrester attributes this to the adoption of smart phones.<p></p>
I would say we are in the biggest growth period for financial and payment APIs since <a class="zem_slink" title="PayPal" rel="homepage" href="http://paypal.com">PayPal</a> launched its API in 2004.<p></p>
With this kind of growth in mobile banking, you can easily predict the need for high quality, secure, financial and payment related APIs.<p></p>
We will see a lot more growth, innovation and competition in the financial API space in next 4 years.

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/xml.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" />XML (<a class="zem_slink" title="XML" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">Extensible Markup Language</a>) is a way for programs to exchange information. It is very similar to <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/definition-json.php">JSON</a> (JavaScript Object Notation).</p>
<p>XML was originally designed to describe documents, but has be adapted to describe anything from contacts to <a class="zem_slink" title="Geographic data" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_data">geographic data</a>.</p>
<p>APIs use XML to describe information. A XML transmission describing me might look like:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/817107.js?file=API%20-%20Tech%20-%20XML"></script>
<p>XML is a markup language much like HTML and uses opening and closing tags to describe content.  It allows computers to tell the difference between my first name and last name, for example, or any other information that it describes.</p>
<p>XML has long been the standard for <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/">Web Service</a> communication, however recently it has been losing ground to JSON because it is considered more bloated and less efficient to use.</p>
<p>As the popularity of <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/definition-rest.php">REST</a> increases, JSON may continue as the preferred standard, but XML will still have a place with many older developers, because it was the original way for web services to communicate.</p>

        <span class="post-date">30 Jan 2011</span>
        <p>On June 29th, 2006,&nbsp;<a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/06/world-is-your-javascript-enabled_29.html" target="_blank">Google launched Google Maps API</a>&nbsp;allowing developers to put Google Maps on their own sites using JavaScript.</p>
<p>The API launch was just shy of 6 months after the&nbsp;<a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/02/mapping-your-way.html" target="_blank">release of Google Maps as an application</a>, and was in direct response to the number of rogue applications developed that were hacking the application.&nbsp;<a href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/index.html" target="_blank"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/google-map-logo.gif" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a>Google Maps was immediately so popular that developers hacked the JavaScript interface and developed application such as<a href="http://www.http//googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/02/mapping-your-way.html" target="_blank">housingmaps.com</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.chicagocime.org">chicagocime.org</a>. The demand was so great for information on hacking Google Maps it spawned books such as&nbsp;<a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596007034" target="_blank">Mapping Hacks</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596004477" target="_blank">Google Hacks</a>&nbsp;from&nbsp;<a class="zem_slink" title="O'Reilly Media" rel="homepage" href="http://www.oreilly.com/">O'Reilly</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/index.html" target="_blank">Google Maps API</a>&nbsp;started a trend of API mashups with its valuable location based data, with over 2000 mashups to date.</p>
<p>The API demonstrates the incredible value of&nbsp;<a class="zem_slink" title="Geographic data" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_data">geographic data</a>&nbsp;and mapping&nbsp;<a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/">APIs</a>, as well as the power users can have in influencing the direction an application or API takes. Lars Rasmussen, the original developer of Google Maps commented how much he learned from the developer community by watching how they hacked the application in real-time, and they took what they learned and applied it to the API we know today.</p>

        <span class="post-date">30 Jan 2011</span>
        APIs are not just for exchanging of <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/data-20/">data</a>. They provide much needed functionality for developers and integrators.
<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/clock_gears.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
The functionality of an API can provide shipping costs as the <a href="http://fedex.com/us/developer/" target="_blank">Fedex API</a> does, or provide you with directions from San Francisco, CA to New York, NY as with the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/index.html" target="_blank">Google Maps API</a>.<p></p>
Functional APIs can, as the name suggests, provide much needed functionality to users that might be very costly or impossible for them to implement on their own.<p></p>
If a developer wants to provide the location of a <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/mobile/">mobile</a> <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/application/">application</a> user, they need to be able to turn the latitude and longitude of the users position into a physical address, city, state and zip code. This would require creating a massive look-up table of latitude, longitude, and addresses. This wouldn't be impossible, but it would be very costly.<p></p>
Functional APIs can save developers time when building their applications by providing needed functionality immediately, cost effectively, and with functionality that would otherwise be impossible without an API.

        <span class="post-date">30 Jan 2011</span>
        Sharing information and services with your partners is vital to your business.  With the complexities of businesses' systems and the security of firewalls, this exchange isn't always easy.<p></p>
Defining what resources you should make available to partners and actually making them available can be a costly and time-intensive endeavor.<p></p>
Establishing a definition of what you want to make available to partners can be easily translated into a plan for what services you will offer through your <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/">API</a>.
<img style="margin: 15px; border: 1px solid #000;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/human-robot-handshake.jpg" alt="" align="right" />
Using API standards such as <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/definition-rest.php">REST</a> and providing API responses in common protocols like <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/definition-xml.php">XML</a> and <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/definition-json.php">JSON</a>, will make it possible for partners to easily work with your <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/">APIs</a>, and increase the likelihood that they incorporate into their business operations.<p></p>
You rely on your relationships with your partners to make your business thrive, and often showcase these relationships to the public to emphasize the the strength of your business.   Your <a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/10/09/why-a-tech-journalist-cares-about-your-api/">API Strategy</a> can take this even further.<p></p>
Your partners often will be the number one reason for launching an API, and the number of partners and quality of your partners will contribute to the image your API has with the public and within your developer community.<p></p>
The success of your partnerships via your API can be the difference between simply having an API and having a thriving <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/ecosystem.php" target="_blank">API ecosystem</a>.

        <span class="post-date">30 Jan 2011</span>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer" target="_blank">REST or Representational State Transfer</a> is term that describes a specific approach to delivering an <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/">API</a> or <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/">web service</a>.<p></p>
REST takes advantage of the same Internet mechanisms that are used to view regular web pages, therefore does not need any special servers or protocols to deliver or view REST <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/">APIs</a>.
<a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596529260" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/restful_large.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a>
There are different opinions of what is truly REST compliant, and many developers have seem to agree that using existing <a class="zem_slink" title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">HTTP</a> mechanisms for your API is considered <a class="zem_slink" title="Representational State Transfer" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer">RESTful</a>, regardless of conforming 100% to REST.<p></p>
REST allows you to take data and functionality available on your web site and make these resources available through a web services, and then return <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/definition-xml.php">XML</a> or <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/definition-json.php">JSON</a> representations of these resources.<p></p>
The reduced complexity of REST makes it more efficient to use in development, and has made it the preferred choice of developers, application architects, and API owners.<p></p>
HTTP, the protocol we use to browse the web, has built in ways to transfer, describe and deliver content to humans.  It makes sense to take advantage of this existing infrastructure to deliver data and functionality between applications.

<p>Almost immediately, developers began to build social applications, games, and mashups with the new development tools.</p>
<p>The Facebook Development Platform gave Facebook an edge over then popular competitor&nbsp;<a href="http://www.myspace.com">MySpace</a>, and established itself as the top social gaming platform with games like&nbsp;<a href="http://www.farmville.com/" target="_blank">Farmville</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">27 Jan 2011</span>
        A common reason for deploying an <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/">API</a> is to share data with users outside of your organization.<p></p>
You need to make information accessible to partners or general public, but in a way that's self-service so you can avoid emailing a spreadsheet every time someone asks for something.
<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/matrix-data-streaming-api.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
You do this with a data API.  Data <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/">APIs</a> can:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Provide an list of names and addresses for your upcoming event.</li>
	<li>Deliver news to web sites and <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/mobile/">mobile</a> phone in real-time.</li>
	<li>Deliver products such as books from Amazon.com to other smaller, specialty web sites just focusing on cookbooks.</li>
	<li>Delivers census data from the federal government about who lives in your state to your local unemployment office.</li>
</ul>
A data API is proving to be the easiest way to exchange information -- whether it's between businesses, between the government and the public, or between your Facebook profile and your mobile phone.<p></p>
Web, desktop, and mobile applications are all being developed to depend on data from various private and public APIs.  These data APIs are launched to satisfy our growing appetite for real-time information and updates on a daily basis.

It is very similar to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML" target="_blank">XML (Extensible Markup Language)</a>.</p>
<p>APIs are are way for programs to communicate and since they don't have voices, they need a way to describe things.  APIs use JSON to describe information.</p>
<p>A JSON transmission describing me might look like:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/817134.js?file=API%20-%20Tech%20-%20JSON"></script>
<p>JSON uses brackets, quotes, colons and commas to separate data, and give the information meaningful structure.  It allows computers to tell the difference between my first name and last name or any other information that describes me.  The protocol sketched above is really just an approximation of what JSON does.  After all, it is meant for computers and not humans,</p>
<p>JSON has become one of the preferred methods for programmers to use for API communication.  It's a light weight, simple way to exchange data across the Internet while still maintaining the structure and meaning of that data.</p>

APIs allow access to information, provide functionality or control electronic gadgets.<p></p>
Companies develop APIs to allow partners and other developers access their information, services and hardware.<p></p>
APIs come in many shapes and size.   The most common type of <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/">API</a> today is known as <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/definition-rest.php">REST</a>.   REST works just like any other web site on the Internet.<p></p>
Whereas people interact with computers via programs, websites, and mobile applications, those programs, web sites, and mobile applications interact with each other via APIs.<p></p>
Every time you use your credit card, an API is used. When you visit a website, it often gets information and delivers its functionality through APIs, such as the latest articles from <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/" target="_blank">NY Times</a>.  Mobile apps on your phone use APIs.<p></p>
APIs are all around you.  You just don't see them.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2011/01/26/managing-api-code-projects-libraries/">Managing API Code Projects &amp; Libraries</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">26 Jan 2011</span>
        Having a framework for managing your API code samples and libraries is essential to providing partners and developers with relevant, useful and functional code they can use to integrate with your API.
<a href="http://github.com" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/github-logo.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a>
First start by breaking down your code into relevant projects that address specific types of integration with your API.<p></p>
Within each project you can create an appropriate title and description and set some goals for the project.<p></p>
Then build your code samples that satisfy the project goals.   After organizing and documenting all code samples, publish them to:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)" target="_blank">GIT</a> - <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">Github</a></strong> is a git based repository service and social coding service.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion" target="_blank">SVN</a> - <a href="http://code.google.com/hosting/" target="_blank">Google Project Hosting</a></strong> is an SVN or Subversion based repository service.  They also provider Mercurial repositories.</li>
</ul>
Both GitHub and Google Project Hosting provide methods for you to manage your code in two popular version control formats.  This will allow API developers and partners to quickly check out code repositories, stay current with updates, and even contribute back to your API code projects.
<a href="http://code.google.com/hosting/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google-project-hosting/google-project-hosting.png" alt="" align="right" /></a>
Publishing your code to GitHub and Google Project hosting will also provide added marketing benefits to your API community, by extending its reach beyond your domain into existing popular social code communities and the open Internet.<p></p>
Make sure and spend time to choose the proper <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_license" target="_blank">open source licensing model</a> for your code projects.<p></p>
Now you have a solid process for managing all your API code that makes them accessible in popular developer communities, your <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/">API</a> area, and widely available on the open Internet.

The eBay API was originally rolled out to only a select number of licensed eBay partners and developers.<p></p>
As eBay stated:
<blockquote><em>"Our new API has tremendous potential to revolutionize the way people do business on eBay and increase the amount of business transacted on the site, by openly providing the tools that developers need to create applications based on eBay technology, we believe eBay will eventually be tightly woven into many existing sites as well as future e-commerce ventures."</em></blockquote>
The eBay API was a response to the growing number of applications that were already relying on its site either legitimately or illegitimately.<p></p>
The API aimed to standardize how applications integrated with eBay, and make it easier for partners and developers to build a business around the eBay ecosystem.<p></p>
eBay is considered the leading pioneer in the current era of web-based APIs and web services.

        <span class="post-date">20 Jan 2011</span>
        One of the aspects of my current job that I enjoy, is the transparent nature of my role. My job is to generate attention for <a href="http://www.mimeo.com">Mimeo</a> and the Mimeo Connect <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/cloud-computing/cloud-print/">Cloud Print</a> <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/">API</a>.<p></p>
Let me give you an example. In various roles I've had at companies as lead developer, director of technology, or just a developer I spend a lot of time researching new technologies.<p></p>
When I research new technologies I usually create some sort of overview document, a presentation and probably some sort of sample code or prototype.
<img style="padding: 20px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/transparency-jellyfish.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
In legacy positions I do all this hard work, and usually submit to my boss and maybe do apresentationto other teams. Often times, my work goes nowhere.<p></p>
In my new role as an API Evangelist I enjoy a lot of transparency. I get to talk about my work as I'm learning. For exmple I wrote these blog posts yesterday:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><a href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/01/programming-with-pdfs/" target="_blank"><strong>Programming with PDFs</strong></a> - I am building a list of APIs and <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/open-source/">Open Source</a> PDF tools I want to use, integrate and create resources for my developers.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/01/programming-with-images-using-imagemagick/" target="_blank"><strong>Programming with Images Using ImageMagick</strong></a> - Similar to PDFs I want a full suite of tools and resources for empower developers to program using images.</li>
</ul>
My project work involves me doing a lot of research and testing, and I get to share this information in real-time. If the projects move forward I will blog about improvements as they happen. So my documentation and presentations often go public as I create them.<p></p>
If a project doesn't go anywhere, the information is still out there. It is still on my blog and on my <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/twitter/">Twitter</a> account. This can bring added SEO benefit to all my projects and help me in the future, you never know when it will come back around.<p></p>
In other roles where I don't enjoy the same transparency this information would never see the light of day.

APIs help enable the current smart phone revolution we're seeing with <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/mobile/iphone/">IPhone</a>, <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/mobile/ipad/">IPad</a>, and <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/mobile/android/">Android</a>.<p></p>
These API-powered movements are significant in our everyday lives and how we conduct business.   Even though the term API economy applies in these contexts, it rings even louder when it comes the actual financial markets.<p></p>
With the <a href="http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1914724,00.html" target="_blank">growing dominance of high frequency trading</a>, APIs such as <a href="http://www.tdameritrade.com/tradingtools/partnertools/api_dev.html" target="_blank">TD Ameritrade API</a> truly signal the beginning of a new API economy.
<img style="padding: 20px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/financial/td-ameritrade-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
These APIs provide programmatic control over:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Trading</li>
	<li>Real-Time Streaming data</li>
	<li>Historical Market Data</li>
</ul>
Cloud computing power like <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/amazon/amazon-ec2/">Amazon EC2</a> combined with financial APIs provide a way to make decisions and trade based upon real-time market data in extremely high volume and make decisions within fractions of a second.<p></p>
The power cloud computing, social networking, mobile phones combined with APIs are truly ushering in a new API driven economy.

You don't want developers to fumble around with lengthy registrations and approval processes.<p></p>
Your API registration needs to be simple and self-service. <a href="http://openid.net" target="_blank">OpenID</a> is one way to do this.<p></p>
<a href="http://stackapps.com">StackApps</a>, the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a> API demonstrates this perfectly.<p></p>
I wanted to see what was possible using the Stack Apps API. My objective is to integrate an API FAQ system with a Stack Overflow site.<p></p>
I went to Stack Apps and clicked on registration. Stack Apps only gives OpenID for registration. They allow you to select from top providers like <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/google/">Google</a> and <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/facebook/">Facebook</a> or use your own OpenID provider.<p></p>
With two clicks I was registered for a Stack Apps developer account, and with one more click I was registering my <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/application/">Application</a> and getting my keys.<p></p>
This is how easy you want to make it for developers to get up and going developing against your API. OpenID is the solution.

        <span class="post-date">17 Jan 2011</span>
        Marketing products and services to developers can be difficult.   They are unlike other consumers and often are difficult to reach and build trust with.
<a href="https://github.com/"><img style="padding: 20px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/github-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>
Recently, I was discussing which group within a company is most likely to initiate a plan for exposing an <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/">API</a>: development, IT, Product Development, or some other? And once released who should own the API?<p></p>
I advocate that all departments should have a stake in the API, and whoever owns it after release should have roots in development.  Not that the development or IT department should own it, but the person in charge should have a development or IT mindset, as well as business development, product development and sales and marketing.  This can be difficult to find.
<h2>Marketing with github</h2>
When marketing your API to developers you can't think like a regular marketer, you have to understand where developers are.  One such place is github, the social coding and repository site.
<a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/0636920010203"><img style="padding: 20px;" src="http://covers.oreilly.com/images/0636920010203/cat.gif" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a>
O'Reilly Media recently identified github as an important marketing tool in the release of their book <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/0636920010203" target="_blank">Mining the Social Web</a> by Matthew A. Russell.  <a href="http://oreilly.com/" target="_blank">O'Reilly</a> uses <a href="https://github.com/ptwobrussell/Mining-the-Social-Web">github as a repository of source code examples from Mining the Social Web</a>.<p></p>
Not only is github a excellent tool for managing the source code of examples for a book targeting developers, but it is also a great way to market the book to an existing, vibrant community of developers like github.<p></p>
When building your marketing strategy for your API community, make sure and consider how you can integrate github with your API code samples, SDKs, applications and developer community.

        <img style="padding: 20px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/google-url-shortner-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />Google launched a much anticipated API for the Google URL shortener today as part of the <a href="http://code.google.com/labs/">Google Code Labs</a>.<p></p>
The Google URL Shortener at goo.gl is a service that takes long URLs and squeezes them into fewer characters to make a link that is easier to share, tweet, or email to friends.<p></p>
The Google URL Shortener API allows you to interact with the service via a RESTful interface, and returns JSON data structures.  Here is the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/urlshortener/overview.html">API Overview</a>, as well as the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/urlshortener/v1/getting_started.html">Getting Started Guide</a>.<p></p>
Google has added to its new API console allowing developers to explore and get familiar with the API interface quickly.

        <span class="post-date">10 Jan 2011</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/AWS_LOGO_CMYK.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />I am taking some time and writing down my image management strategy to share with <a href="http://www.audreywatters.com" target="_blank">Audrey</a>.  I have a specific process and set of tools I use to manage images I use across my <a href="http://www.kinlane.com" target="_blank">Kin Lane Blog</a>, <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/">API Evangelist Blog</a> and my Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook and other online properties.<p></p>
I store all my images centrally at <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/amazon/amazon-s3/">Amazon S3</a>.  This may not be an ideal solution for everyone, but it works for me.  Its a complete storage area for all my images, audio, video and other documents.<p></p>
I use a combination of <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com" target="_blank">Amazon Console</a>, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3247/" target="_blank">S3Fox for Firefox</a>, <a href="http://cyberduck.ch/" target="_blank">Cyberduck</a> and <a href="https://www.jungledisk.com/" target="_blank">Jungle Disk</a> to manage my Amazon S3 files.  No time to explain the madness, it just works.<p></p>
I have a central bucket at Amazon S3 for storing ALL images I need to support my public online properties.   I have set a bucket policy for this bucket enforcing that all objects within are automatically publicly available.  This saves me time in having to set the ACL for each object.<p></p>
When I have a screenshot or creative commons image that I have found that I need to use in my blog I download, crop, resize, download and rename.    Then I immediately upload to my Amazon S3 public bucket, and then copy the location to my clipboard.<p></p>
With the URL of the image on Amazon S3 I go back to Wordpress and paste the URL in my blog content as an image.<p></p>
Amazon S3 in conjunction with S3Fox, Cyberduck, Jungle Disk and this process allows me to store ALL images I need for my public work in a central location that I own.<p></p>
My Amazon Web Services account is the center of my cloud storage world.  It is important that I store all my vital files here.  In the future I know where to find them and won't lost any valuable images I've used in content I have created.

In addition to the two new support plans AWS reduced the usage-based pricing for the Silver and gold plans by 50%.<p></p>
If  that wasn't enough, Amazon increased its responsiveness for normal  severity support cases from 24 business hours to 12 business hours, and  low severity cases from 48 to 24 hours.<p></p>

        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/quora-logo.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />Quora has exposed a <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/definition-json.php" target="_blank">JSON</a>-based data API that allows users to access data about a currently logged-in user.<p></p>
To  request particular fields about the currently logged-in user, you can  add fields to a query string and append to  <a href="Quora Exposes JSON API" target="_blank">http://api.quora.com/api/logged_in_user</a>.<p></p>
Currently supported fields include:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Inbox</li>
	<li>Followers</li>
	<li>Following</li>
	<li>Notifs</li>
</ul>

This will return Inbox and Notification related information for the authenticated user.<p></p>
This  is not a full-blown API release by Quora.  Quora engineer Edmond Lau  posted information on Quora about the API, stating that it is in its  alpha stage and is only meant to support existing <a href="http://www.quora.com/Is-anyone-working-on-a-Quora-Chrome-extension" target="_blank">Quora Chrome</a> and  <a href="http://www.quora.com/Is-anyone-working-on-a-Quora-Chrome-extension" target="_blank">Quora Firefox extensions</a>.<p></p>
Even  though it doesn't have all the supporting elements of an official API  release, the fact that the Q&amp;A startup has established <a href="http://api.quora.com/">api.quora.com</a> for its use, indicates that it plans to invest more energy around an official <a href="http://www.quora.com/Edmond-Lau/Quora-Extension-API" target="_blank">Quora API</a>.

        <p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/facebook/Facebook-Developer.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />Any building block you are using to deliver your API to developers, such as blog or forum should have metrics attached to it.  You should be collecting any data you can on activity in your API community and reporting on it.</p>
<p>I received a platform update from <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/439" target="_blank">Facebook developer community</a>, with the following stats:</p>
<p><a href="http://bugs.developers.facebook.net/" target="_blank">Bugzilla</a> activity for the past seven days:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>117 new bugs were reported</li>
<li>3 bugs were reproducible and accepted (after duplicates removed)</li>
<li>19 bugs were fixed (18 previously reported bugs and 1 new bug)</li>
<li>As of today, there are 4,032 open bugs in Bugzilla</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://forum.developers.facebook.net/" target="_blank">Developer Forum</a> activity for the past seven days:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>557 new topics were created</li>
<li>377 new topics received at least one reply in the past week</li>
<li>Of those, 152 were replied to by an admin</li>
<li>Of those, 187 were replied to by a moderator</li>
</ul>
<p>These are great examples of how to report on metrics that give good insights into the Facebook developer community.</p>
<p>Setting metrics, gathering data, and making sense of this data will make you more knowledgeable about your API community participants, and sharing these findings with your community will increase transparency and bring your community closer together.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Nov 2010</span>
        <p>As the Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API Evangelist, I get asked why I would be an evangelist for technology in a dying industry.  Print and Publishing.</p>
<p>My primary argument is: Through new technology such as cloud computing, social media, and mobile the print and publishing industry will be redefined.  We won't even recognize it as the old beast.</p>
<p>One example of this is <a href="http://www.shapeways.com" target="_blank">Shapeways</a>.  Shapeways turns 3D designs and drawings to tangible products through 3D printing. <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/shapeways/shapeways-logo.png" alt="" width="400" align="right" /> You can choose from their pre-defined creators to build proven products, partner with other designers to create a product or upload your own designs to the Shapeways platform.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.shapeways.com" target="_self">Shapeways</a> will check your 3D model that you upload to make sure it can be printed properly before sending to their production facility.</p>
<p>Once in production, the 3D model in your digital file will be printed layer by layer using one of four 3D printing machines &amp; technologies:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_laser_sintering" target="_blank">Selective Laser Sintering (SLS)</a> </strong>- SLS is an additive manufacturing technique that uses a high power laser to fuse small particles of plastic, metal, ceramic, or glass powders into a mass that has a desired 3-dimensional shape.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereolithography" target="_blank">Stereolithography (SLA) </a></strong>- Stereolithography is an additive manufacturing process using a vat of liquid UV-curable photopolymer "resin" and a UV laser to build parts a layer at a time. On each layer, the laser beam traces a part cross-section pattern on the surface of the liquid resin.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fused_deposition_modeling" target="_blank">Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) </a></strong>- FDM works on an "additive" principle by laying down material in layers. A plastic filament or metal wire is unwound from a coil and supplies material to an extrusion nozzle which can turn on and off the flow.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laminated_object_manufacturing" target="_blank">Laminate Object Manufacturing (LOM)</a> </strong>- LOM is a rapid prototyping system that layers adhesive-coated paper, plastic, or metal laminates are successively glued together and cut to shape with a knife or laser cutter.</li>
</ul>
<p>Plastic objects are printed and delivered in 10 working days, and metal objects take 14 working days to arrive.</p>
<p>Cloud print Application Programming Interfaces (API) will allow web and mobile applications to interface with new print and manufacturing technology spanning facilities world wide.</p>
<p>Cloud print and manufacturing APIs will give existing publishing and manufacturing industries new life, and invent entirely new forms of printing, prototyping, and manufacturing we haven't even conceived.</p>

        <span class="post-date">22 Nov 2010</span>
        I spend a lot of time thinking about new ways to print as the Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API Evangelist.  During this time I see a common pattern; that print can create more meaningful, physical aspects of our online lives.<p></p>
We create volumes of data through our social streams, online files, emails and other forms data in our daily online lives.  Often times the photos and discussions become less valuable because they are so easy to create, so we lose interest in creating organizing photos, emails or other files.<p></p>
This is where I see print being able to be reborn in creating physical, tangible, and more valuable snapshots of our online lives.
<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/facebook/facebook_logo-icon.png" alt="" align="right" />
I talked about <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/2010/11/fotobooks-on-facebook/" target="_blank">fotobooks</a> which allows you to <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/2010/11/fotobooks-on-facebook/" target="_blank">print out photo books created from your Facebook profile</a>.  I came across another tool that allows you to print a book from your Facebook profile.<p></p>
<a href="http://www.ninuku.com/ninuku.html" target="_blank">Ninuku Archivist</a> is a Facebook application that automatically downloads stuff from your wall on a monthly basis, then saves it into a PDF doc.   It will pull your profile, streams, and photos from your Facebook profile and create a stored version of these.<p></p>
This social PDF book could easily be send to the Mimeo REST Cloud Print API and arrive on your doorstep as a printed book the next day.   This would be a way to take our online lives and create a physical archive that we can put on the bookshelf for the future.<p></p>
Ninuku Archivist is a little buggy, and the UI difficult to use.  I never quite got my book created.   I see potential though.  With an optimized user interface, and opening up with an API there would be huge potential to create different types of social books and create more  meaningful, physical versions of your Facebook life.

        <span class="post-date">19 Nov 2010</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/wall-street.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" />Many APIs deliver the same type of data like city, country or other factual data.  Other APIs deliver similar functionality like geo-location and currency conversions.<p></p>
The opportunity to develop Universal APIs or Aggregated APIs that bring together common web services into a single source is growing.<p></p>
One example of API aggregation is the <a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com/2010/11/17/deltacloud-review/" target="_blank">Deltacloud</a> which provide aggregated access to multiple cloud computing platforms such as <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/rackspace/" target="_blank">Rackspace</a> and <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/amazon/amazon-ec2/" target="_blank">Amazon EC2</a> via a single web service.<p></p>
Aggregation of APIs opens up opportunities to provide redundancy, deliver caching and other ways of improve API availability and performance.<p></p>
Aggregators will eventually commoditize certain API services such as geo-location, IP address look-up, storage, and computing and will create markets for services such as Amazon EC2 Spot Instances.  This will create competition and ultimately drive down pricing and create opportunities for bulk discounts.<p></p>
API aggregation markets will lead the way for interoperability and standards among API service providers, make integration easier for developers and make it easier to manage the growing number of APIs that are being used in application development.

        <span class="post-date">19 Nov 2010</span>
        It is not always easy to get up and running using a new API.  As a developer you face all kinds of challenges before integration, like finding and making sense of documentation and authentication and setting up code samples.<p></p>
Sometimes it can take several attempts before you are actually able to understand how an API operates and begin using it.  And often times this can mean not adopting an API at all, because you just don't have the time to spend learning about it.
<a href="http://app.apigee.com/console/" target="_blank"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/apigee-api-console.jpg" alt="" width="360" align="right" /></a>
<a href="http://www.apigee.com" target="_blank">Apigee</a> released an <a href="http://app.apigee.com/console/" target="_blank">API console</a> last week that allows you to easily explore eight top APIs:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Twitter</li>
	<li>Facebook</li>
	<li>Foursquare</li>
	<li>LinkedIn</li>
	<li>SimpleGeo</li>
	<li>Paypal</li>
	<li>Soundcloud</li>
	<li>Twilio</li>
</ul>
Using the console you can select an API for exploration.  It then lists the services and endpoints for that web service in a left hand tree-view menu.<p></p>
You can authenticate using OAuth and select an API method which displays the URL in the explorer address bar, then you select GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE.<p></p>
You can then test the web service and see the resulting API request and response.   The Apigee Console allows you to explore an API with almost no effort or coding.<p></p>
This type of exploration is critical in understanding how an API works and helps you brainstorm ways you can integrate it with your application.   I see the Apigee Console reducing API integration time and ultimately resulting in more API adoption.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2010/11/13/developing-api-documentation/">Developing API Documentation</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">13 Nov 2010</span>
        <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/peter-gruenbaum/0/41b/695" target="_blank">Peter Gruenbaum</a> of <a href="http://www.sdkbridge.com/" target="_blank">SDK Bridge</a> shared an article in the company's November newsletter that resonated with some of the work I've been doing recently -- creating API documentation for the Mimeo Connect REST Print API.<p></p>
The article is titled <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/gg309172.aspx" target="_blank">A Coder's Guide to Writing API Documentation</a> and appeared in MSDN Magazine.<p></p>
Gruenbaum says that writing good API documentation requires the four components:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li><strong>Overview:</strong> Explaining what advantages developers have in using the platform, and in some cases, providing an architectural description of the platform.</li>
	<li><strong>Getting started:</strong> Helping the developer get started, in the form of step-by-step tutorials or simpler walkthroughs.</li>
	<li><strong>Sample code:</strong> Providing well-commented code samples that developers can build on.</li>
	<li><strong>Reference material:</strong> Providing detailed information about each class, member, function or XML element.</li>
</ul>
I have been writing sample PHP code while authenticating and writing calls against every endpoint on the REST Print API this week.<p></p>
I have five developers interested in integrating the API into their applications.   So I have been working on and overview and a getting started guide to our API.<p></p>
I have been keeping reference materials to each web service on a wiki as I play with and learn more about our API.<p></p>
Seems like I already have a good start, and seeing Gruenbaum's list of what makes up good API documentation validates where I chose to start with our API documentation this week.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2010/11/09/fotobooks-on-facebook/">fotobooks on Facebook</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">09 Nov 2010</span>
        I'm going through the my list of existing and potential self-publishing and print-on-demand applications.   First on my list is the <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/fotobooks/">fotobooks the Facebook social print application</a>.<p></p>
Its a pretty straightforward app allowing you to organize photos from your Facebook albums into small photo books.
<a href="http://apps.facebook.com/fotobooks/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/mimeo/fotobooks.jpg" alt="" align="right" /></a>
With 2 clicks you can have the application installed in your Facebook profile:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Click Getting Started from fotobooks home page</li>
	<li>Allow the applications request for permissions</li>
</ul>
The application is now installed and you can assemble and order a fotobook in 7 steps:
<ol class="mainlist">
	<li>Click create new book</li>
	<li>Select cover design, and give book a title</li>
	<li>Drag photos from albums onto 19 pages of your fotobook</li>
	<li>Preview your fotobook</li>
	<li>Enter order quantity and delivery</li>
	<li>Enter shipping and billing information</li>
	<li>Pay $5.99 for the book with paypal express or credit card</li>
</ol>
The fotobooks application is a great example of the next generation of social publishing.  I have hit a point of exhaustion with digital photos and social sharing of my photos.  Social tools like <a href="http://instagr.am/">Instagr.am</a> and <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/fotobooks/">fotobooks</a> have renewed my energy for taking photos.<p></p>
fotobooks is first on my list of applications to showcase what is possible with the Mimeo Connect Print API platform.  It is an existing application, stay tuned for more examples, and random ideas I come up with in my adventures as Mimeo Connect API Evangelist.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2010/11/09/api-evangelist-the-business-of-your-api/">API Evangelist - The Business of Your API</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">09 Nov 2010</span>
        I have launched a new site called <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com" target="_blank">API Evangelist</a>.  I have been operating in stealth mode because I'm not 100% done with all the API Ecosystem building block pages.  I've had a couple people ask if I'm a perfectionist, and why don't I just launch.  So here we go.<p></p>
My goal behind <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/" target="_blank">API Evangelist</a>. is to go beyond just the technology of APIs or being a directory of APIs like <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com" target="_blank">ProgrammableWeb</a> is.  I want to focus on the business of APIs, which is an area I feel is neglected in over 75% of APIS, even the successful ones.<p></p>
API Evangelist reflects my research, and I'm looking to provide the following types of posts:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Analysis</li>
	<li>Building Blocks</li>
	<li>News</li>
	<li>Review</li>
	<li>Services</li>
</ul>
My goal is to monitor how the leading API providers are delivering their APIs to the world and managing their community.  As I review APIs for the blog I enter them into a database and keep track of building blocks, technology, formats, and other characteristics.  I will be providing more tools for searching and cross-referencing this data as time goes on.<p></p>
You can view the site at:  <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com" target="_blank">http://www.apievangelist.com</a>
You can view the blog at:  <a href="http://blog.apievangelist.com" target="_blank">http://blog.apievangelist.com</a><p></p>
This site is my research and learning around the business of APIs, to put to use as the API Evangelist for <a href="http://www.mimeo.com" target="_blank">Mimeo</a>.   As I pay attention to top API providers, API service providers, and best practices around the business APIs I feel there is a lot of value to share, and structuring it in this way helps me learn more.<p></p>
Let me know your thoughts.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2010/11/07/monitoring-apis-and-their-availability/">Monitoring APIs and Their Availability</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">07 Nov 2010</span>
        <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/api-status" alt="" align="right" />Applications are being built around APIs at an ever-increasing pace.  Developers put a lot of trust in these service providers, and we depend on them to provide a certain quality of service.<p></p>
As a developer, you should build in error handling to deal with service outages properly.   When deciding to use an API you might want to look at a service that monitors the availability of Public APIs called <a href="http://api-status.com/">API Status</a>.   API Status monitors almost 50 top APIS and provide information on whether the API is:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Operating Normally</li>
	<li>Experiencing Performance Issues</li>
	<li>Having a Service Disruption</li>
</ul>
The real-time status report for Public APIs is provided by <a href="http://www.watchmouse.com">WatchMouse</a>.   WatchMouse provides online monitoring services and has an API as well.<p></p>
In addition to monitoring, I would like to see a rating system for API service providers based upon their availability and up-time.  This would help developers make decisions around whether an API is quality enough to integrate with or not.<p></p>
I would also like to see more competition in the API space, then in addition to gracefully handling of API failures, we could also build in failover into our applications.  This would not work with specific services like Twitter for example, but if it is a service that provides a calculation like IP address lookup, or address verification you could have a plan A or plan B when making API calls.<p></p>
We put a lot of trust into API service providers and hope they take their API seriously enough to not only keep up and running, but also provide a high quality of service.   API availability and service level agreements will be critical in the future API-driven economy.
