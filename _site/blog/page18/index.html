        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/05/08/openapidriven-documentation-for-your-api-with-redoc/">OpenAPI-Driven Documentation For Your API With ReDoc</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">08 May 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/redoc/redoc-demo.png" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc">ReDoc</a> is the responsive, three-panel, OpenAPI specification driven documentation for your API that you were looking for. <a href="http://swagger.io/swagger-ui/">Swagger UI</a> is still reigning king when it comes to API documentation generated using the OpenAPI Spec, but ReDoc provides a simple, attractive, and clean alternative to documentation.<br class="kix-line-break" /></p>
<p>ReDoc is deployable to any web page with just two tags--with the resulting documentation looking attractive on both web and mobile devices. Now you can have it all, your API documentation looking good, interactive, and driven by a machine-readable definition that will help you keep everything up to date.</p>
<p>All you need to fire up ReDoc is two lines of HTML on your web page:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/8592cc6993b8614ef93cda8eb59ce245.js"></script>
<p>The quickest way to deploy ReDoc is using the CDN step shown above, but they also provide bower or npm solutions, if that is your desire. There is also a <a href="https://github.com/Rebilly/generator-openapi-repo">Yeoman generator to help you share your OpenAPIs that are central of your web application operation</a>, something we will write about in future posts here on the blog.<br class="kix-line-break" /></p>
<p>ReDoc leverages a custom HTML tag, and provides you with a handful of attributes for defining, and customizing their documentation, including specurl, scroll-y-offset, suppress-warnings, lazy-rendering, hid-hostname, and expand-responses--providing some quick ways to get exactly what you need, on any web page.</p>
<p>There is a handful of APIs who have put ReDocs to use as API documentation for their platform:<br class="kix-line-break" /></p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://rebilly.github.io/RebillyAPI">Rebilly</a> </li>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/05/05/the-value-of-operational-level-api-exhaust-systems/">The Value Of Operational Level API Exhaust Systems</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">05 May 2017</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/api_data_exhaust_system.jpg" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p>When thinking about generating revenue generated from APIs it is easy to focus on directly charging for any digital resource being made available via the API. If it's an image, we charge per API call, and maybe the amount of MB transferred. If it's messaging, we charge per message. There are plenty of existing examples out there regarding how you directly charge for data, content, or algorithms using APIs, and an API way of doing business--look to Amazon, Twilio, and other pioneers.</p>
<p>Where there are fewer examples and less open discussions, is around the value of the operation level of APIs,Â and making these data available via APIs--yes APIs for APIs. Modern approaches to doing APIs are all about requiring each application to use an API key with each call they make, the logging of each request and response, possessing the identifying key for each application. This is how API providers are developing an awareness of who is accessing resources, how they are being put them to use, and specific details about each application, and maybe even the users involved.</p>
<p>Sometimes the value generated at this layer doesn't exist. Due to restrictive access models, and direct revenue models, there isn't much going on operationally, so there isn't much value generated. However, when there is heavy usage around APIs, the exhaust of the API management layer can become increasingly valuable. What are people searching for? What are applications most popular? Which geographic regions are the most active? There is a pretty lengthy laundry list of valuable data points being applied across modern API operations, that are helping API providers better understand what is going on, that aren't often being included as part of the API road map, and future revenue models.</p>
<p>Ok, let me pause here for a moment. I identify the value being generated at this layer because I see existing providers reaching this realization in their operations, as well as wanting to help other providers see the potential being achieved by successful API providers. I also acknowledge there is a lot of exploitation, abuse, and surveillance going on at this level, which is one of the biggest reasons I'm encouraging more transparency, observability, and discussion about this layer. I want API providers to understand the potential, but I also want API consumers and the end users of their applications to understanding what is going on at the API operational layer as well.Â </p>
<p>The current model I'm looking at through this lens currently is around my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/31/gathering-my-thoughts-about-open-referral-and-the-human-services-api/">Open Referral Human Services Data Specification (HSDS)</a> work, where I'm trying to help define the operational layer of human services APIs, as well as the direct API access to this critical public data. I am asking the question of how stewards of this very important data at the municipal level leverage APIs to make their valuable resources more accessible, and put to work where it is most needed, while also being able to generate and harness the valuable particles generated as part of an API exhaust system. What are people searching for? How are demographics evolving in a city, and how can city services shift and evolve too. Making the operational layer available via API so that it is available to key decision makers, even if those are private sector decisions makers who are required to pay for access to this intelligence--bringing critical new revenue streams for data stewards.</p>
<p>Let's pause again and be honest about the privacy concerns here. Access at this layer needs an additional level of scrutiny and care, over the direct access layers. Examples I'm concerned with can be seen in searches for Muslim religious services, or possibly LGBTQ services, and other information that could be used to violate the privacy and rights of application developers and end users. There are numerous privacy and security concerns at this level, but the inverse of these concerns also highlight the value of a data access exhaust system at this level. This is important information, that can provide some real time signals for both the public and private sector to consider more deeply.</p>
<p>I am purposely using the word <span style="text-decoration: underline;">exhaust</span> here, specifically as a noun, as I don't think people are considering this layer, and may often see log files, and other ways data being generated in this as way as an unusable byproduct and output of web and mobile operations. I want to help people see the potential dangers of exhaust from API-centric data operations, but also understand that when it is captured, it can become valuable, similar to natural gas capture from recycling or landfill operations. There are some toxic aspects of API-driven data operations, but when measured and controlled, and made more observable, the dangerous aspects can be mitigated, and you might also find ways that other reuse and extraction that can also occur along the way.Â </p>

        <span class="post-date">05 May 2017</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/bw_percentage_api.png" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p>I'm involved in some very interesting conversations with public data folks who are trying to push forward the conversation around sensible revenue generation by cities, counties, state, and the federal government using public data. I'm learning a lot from these conversations, resulting in the expansion and evolution my perceptions of how the API layer can help the government develop new revenue streams through making public data more accessible.Â </p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/08/24/setting-a-precedent-when-charging-for-high-volume-access-to-government-apis/">I have long been a proponent of using modern API management infrastructure to help government agencies generate revenue using public data</a>. I would also add that I'm supportive of the crafting of sensible approaches to developing applications on top of public data and API in ways that generate a fair profit for private sector actors. I am also in favor of free and unfettered access to data, and observability into the platform operations, as well as ALL commercial interests developing applications on top of public data and APIs. I'm only in favor of this, when the right amount of observability is present--otherwise digital good olÂ boy networks form, and the public will lose.</p>
<p><a href="http://management.apievangelist.com">API management is the oldest area of my API research</a>, expanding into my other work to eventually defineÂ <a href="http://documentation.apievangelist.com/">documentation</a>, <a href="http://sdk.apievangelist.com/">SDKs</a>, <a href="http://communication.apievangelist.com/">communication</a>, <a href="http://support.apievangelist.com/">support</a>, <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/">monetization</a>, and <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">API plans</a>. This is where you define the business of API operations, organizing APIs into coherent catalogs, where you can then work to begin establishing a wider monetization strategy, as well as tiers and plans that govern access to data, content, and algorithms being made available via APIs. This is the layer of API operations I'm focusing on when helping government agencies better understand how they can get more in tune with their data resources, and identify potential partnerships and other applications that might establish new revenue streams.</p>
<p>A portion of thisÂ conversation that I am having was involved in the <a href="https://www.citylab.com/tech/2017/04/maybe-government-data-shouldnt-always-be-free/523095/">story from Anthony Williams about maybe government data shouldn't always be free</a>, where the topic of taxation came up. One possible analogy for public data access and monetization was brought up as a reference to theÂ <a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/ipd/revenue/road_pricing/defined/vmt.aspx">Vehicle-miles Traveled (VMT) tax</a>, injecting the concept of taxation to my existing thoughts on revenue generation using API management. I've considered affiliate and reseller aspects to the API management layer before, applying percentage based revenue and payments on top of API access, but never thought about a government taxation layer existing here.</p>
<p>I thought my stance on revenue generation on public data using API management was controversial before, adding in concepts of taxation to the discussion is really going to invigorate folks who are in opposition to my argument. I'm sure there is a libertarian free web, open data advocate, smaller government Venn diagram in there somewhere. I'm not too concerned, as the monetization is already going on, I'm simply talking about making it more observable, and in favor of revenue generation for data stewards and government agencies. I'm confident that most won't folks in opposition won't even read this paragraph, as it's buried in the middle of this post. ;-)</p>
<p>I take no stance on which data, content, or algorithms should be taxed, or what that tax rate should be. I leave this to data stewards and policy makers. My objective is to just introduce folks to the concept, and marry with the existing approaches to using APIs to develop digital products and services in the private sector. However, if I was wearing my policy maker hat I would suggest thinking about this as a digital <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-added_tax">VAT tax, <em>"that is collected incrementally, based on the surplus value, added to the price on the work at each stage of production, which is usually implemented as a destination-based tax, where the tax rate is based on the location of the customer."</em></a></p>
<p>My thoughts on a government tax at the API management layer are at an early stage. I am just exploring the concept on my blog--this is what I do as the API Evangelist. I'd love to hear your thoughts, on your blog. I am merely suggesting a digital VAT tax at the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/15/an-api-definition-as-the-truth-in-the-api-contract/">API contract layer</a> around public data and APIs when commercial activities are involved. Eventually, I could see the concept spread to other sectors as the API economy becomes a reality, but I feel that public data provides us with a rich test bed for a concept like this. I'm considering reframing my argument about charging for commercial access to public data using APIs as taxing commercial usage of public data using APIs, allowing for tax revenue to fund future investment in public data and API efforts.</p>
<p>As I remove my API Evangelist hat and think about this concept, I'm not 100% sure if I'm in agreement with my argument. It will take a lot more polishing before I'm convinced that taxation should be included in the API management layer. I'll keep exploring, and play with a variety of potential use cases, and see if I can build a case for API taxation when public data is involved, and applications are generating surplus value in the API economy.Â </p>

<p><a href="http://facebook.stack.network">Profiling APIs always provides me with a nice bulleted list of what a company does or doesn't do</a>. In my&nbsp;work as the API Evangelist, I can read marketing and communications to find out what a company does, but <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/10/03/apis-can-give-an-honest-view-of-what-a-company-does/">I find that profiling their APIs provides a more honest view of what is going on</a>. The lack of a public API always sets the tone for how I view what a company is up to, but when there is a public API, profiling it always provides a nice distillation of what a company does, in a nice bulleted list I can share with my readers.</p>
<p>When I profile the APIs of companies like <a href="http://amazon.web.services.stack.network/">Amazon</a>, <a href="http://google.stack.network/">Google</a>, and <a href="http://microsoft.stack.network/">Microsoft</a>, I come out of it with a nice bulleted list of what is possible, but when I go even further, making sure each API profile has accompanying&nbsp;schema definitions, a nice list of what data company&nbsp;begins to emerge. When I profile an API using <a href="http://openapis.org">OpenAPI</a> I always start by profiling the request layer of an API, the paths, parameters, and other elements. Next, I get to work describing the schema definitions of data used in these requests, as well as the structure of the responses--providing me with a nice bulleted list of the data that a company has.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://facebook.stack.network/">You can see this in action with my Facebook API profiling work</a>. There is a bulleted list of what is possible (API definition), as well as what data is sent, received, and stored (API schema). This work provides me with a&nbsp;nice look at the data Facebook gathers and stores about everyone. It is FAR from a complete picture of the data Facebook gathers, but it does provide us with a snapshot to consider, as well as a model we can ask Facebook to share more schema about the data points that they track. API and data specification formats like <a href="http://json-schema.org/">JSON Schema</a>, and <a href="http://openapis.org">OpenAPI</a> provides us with a toolbox to help us quantify and share the details of what data a company has, and what is possible when it comes to using this data in web, mobile, and device based applications.</p>
<p>I fully aware of the boldness of this statement, but I feel that ALL companies should have a public API definition, including a catalog of the schema for data in use. Ideally, this schema would employ commonly used standards like <a href="http://schema.org">Schema.org</a>, but just having a machine-readable catalog of the schema would go a long way to helping pull back the curtain of how companies are using our data. I am not asking for companies to make data public, I am asking for companies to make the schema for this data public, showing what they track and store about us. I know many people view this as intellectual property, but in an increasingly un/insecure online world of digital privacy, we are going to have to begin pulling back the curtain a little bit, otherwise, a rich environment for exploitation and abuse will continue to develop.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 May 2017</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/api_stack_screen.png" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p>It has been over a year since I've pushed any API definitions to <a href="http://theapistack.com/">my API Stack research</a>, but I finally was able to prioritize time this week to make sure it was updated with the latest profiles I have in my API monitoring system. I pushed 1,173 companies who are doing interesting things with APIs. Not all of them have a traditional API program, but most of them do. It isn't all of the API related companies in my tracking system, but it's definitely the core group of what I'm watching.</p>
<p>Each API is profiled with <a href="http://apisjson.org">an APIs.json file</a>, providing an index of the name, description, tags, and other metadata, but also provides the URLs for documentation, Github, Twitter, and other key aspects of API operations. When there is an OpenAPI present, I publish a copy of it, with a URL for the resource, within each index. I have a bunch more OpenAPI definitions to publish, but they will take some considerable cleaning up before they are ready for prime time--look for regular updates now that I have the bulk of it updated.</p>
<p><a href="http://theapistack.com/">My API Stack runs 100% on Github, like the rest of my research</a>. All the data behind is available in APIs.jsonÂ and OpenAPI, both as JSON and YAML--take your pick. <a href="https://github.com/api-stack/api-stack">I prefer YAML being the core of everything and stored in the _data folder</a>, but I tend to also put up JSON and HTML facades on this data when it makes sense. The homepage for the project is just an HTML listing done in Liquid, driven from the YAML in the _data folder, making it easy to play with different views of the APIs indexed as part of the collection.</p>
<p>At over 1000 APIs the repository is getting pretty unwieldy to commit each time, and i've begun the process of breaking up most of the larger APIs into their own repositories for individual management, projects like <a href="http://amazon.web.services.stack.network/">AWS</a>, <a href="http://google.stack.network/">Google</a>, <a href="http://microsoft.stack.network/">Microsoft</a>, and <a href="http://facebook.stack.network/">Facebook</a>. I will keep most of the lesser known APIs as part of the main API Stack collection, but will continue to slice off the APIs, as well as individual stacks of APIs like <a href="http://email.stack.network/">email</a>, <a href="http://sms.stack.network/">SMS</a>, and <a href="http://news.stack.network/">news</a> into their own repositories for indepdenteÂ managment and evolution. I'm happy to finally have this updated, as I'm starting to find some really rich indexes of OpenAPI stashes on Github, and I want to start ingesting them as part of my larger index, something I didn't want to do until this was updated.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 May 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-business-api-response.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>It made me happy to read <a href="https://medium.com/point-nine-news/the-rise-of-non-vc-compatible-saas-companies-47054f1f3b29">the Rise of Non &ldquo;VC compatible&rdquo; SaaS Companies</a>, and see that there are more sensible discussions going on around how to develop SaaS business, something that I hope spreads into the specifically API as a product startups and API service providers. I know that many of my readers think I'm anti-VC--I am not. Or may I'm anti-startup--I am not. I'm anti-VC and anti-startup ideology becoming the dominant religion, pushing out a lot of really good people and ideas who can't play that game.</p>
<p>When it comes to Silicon Valley, if you push back, you get excluded from the club, and there are waves of people who step up to tell you "not all startups are bad" or "not all VCs are bad"--I wish I could help you understand how this response makes you look. Of course, they aren't all bad, but there are bad ones, and there is a lot of rhetoric that this is the ONLY way you can build technology when it isn't. There are plenty of ways you can develop technology, and build a business without the VC approach, or the cult of the startup.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are more instructions you should follow in the rise of the non-VC compatible SaaS companies story, but the author outlines four types of SaaS companies, which I think applies nicely to APIi companies, as many of them will be SaaS &nbsp;providers:</p>
<ol class="postList">
<li id="090f" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong><span class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Funded SaaS</span>:</strong> companies which finance their business with VCs a.k.a equity against money. From early stage startups with no revenue to companies going public with hundreds of millions of dollars of ARR, the range is extremely wide.</li>
<li id="324a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><span class="markup--strong markup--li-strong"><strong>Bootstrapped &ldquo;scaling&rdquo; SaaS companies</strong>:&nbsp;</span>SaaS companies which manage to pass the $10M ARR threshold without VC money. Ex: Mailchimp or Atlassian (which raise VC money but at a very late stage) have reached the hundreds of millions of dollars of ARR without VC money. These &ldquo;unicorns among unicorns&rdquo; are very rare.</li>
<li id="b9a5" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong><span class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Bootstrapped SaaS companies</span></strong>: bootstrapped companies which manage to reach the $300k &mdash; $10M ARR range without VC money.</li>
<li id="7d9d" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong><span class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Bootstrapped Micro SaaS:</span></strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;1 to 3&rdquo; people companies which operate in the $1k &mdash; $300k ARR range, without VC money.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are some ideas that should go VC, but there are even more that should not. I want to see more talk like this about the funding realities of an API startups. A sensible discussion about what the goals are, how fast a company should grow, and whether the company is building a business to develop software solutions that we sell to customers, or a business to sell some large enterprise--hell, maybe even go IPO. These are all viable options for your business, I'm just looking for more discussion about the priorities. One more thing, you should be having this discussion out in the open with the customers you are supposedly selling your products and services to--this is the important part, not just the having of the discussion.</p>
<p>I'm not trying to get in the way of you getting super filthy rich. I'm just trying to strike a balance between you building a company, and the stability and availability of your APIs, and API tools and services, in an industry I depend on to make my living. You see, APIs have gotten a bad wrap for not being stable, and going away at any time. This isn't an API thing, this is a VC funded startup thing. When you are telling your companies that you are building a business, with products and services to purchase, and then everyone bakes your solutions into their solutions, and you go away--that sucks. If you tell people the truth from the beginning and are honest and communicative about what your plans are, people can build and plan accordingly--the problem isn't APIs going away, it is startup founders not caring.</p>
<p>I am just trying to strike a balance between your business aspirations, and those of the people I help convince to use your APIs. Many of them aren't trying to get rich. They are just trying to build a business, and get their work done with your service, tool, and API. Let's start having more honest and open conversation about the variety of business models available to use when building API startups, and remember that not everything is a VC-worthy idea, sometimes you are just a viable feature for regular business owners like me.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 May 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/bw_evaluation.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I am helping a customer think through their decision-making process around the adoption of a new API service, and while I am doing this I am spending the time to think through my own API adoption process. I like having checklists to consider when making new purchasing and integration decision. Sometimes I have an immediate need which is driven by emotion, and it can help to step back and think through a more rational checklist I established for myself on a previous date.</p>
<p>When I am approaching a new API that I think might move beyond just playing around, and actually have a viable business use case in my operations, I think through the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Define Value -</strong> What value is being created by an API I'm looking to use.</li>
<li><strong>Define Needs - </strong>What needs do I have which using an API will solve.</li>
<li><strong>Define Options -</strong> What other solutions are there beyond this API.</li>
<li><strong>Think About Today - </strong>Is this an immediate need I have with days or weeks.</li>
<li><strong>Think About Tomorrow -</strong> Is this a long term need that will go on for years.</li>
<li><strong>Vet Company &amp; People - </strong>More detail about the company, people, and investors.</li>
<li><strong>Define Partners -</strong> What does my the partnership landscape look like for the API.</li>
<li><strong>What Things Cost - </strong>What are things going to cost be for using an API.</li>
<li><strong>What You Can Afford -</strong> Can I really afford using this service, or not use.</li>
<li><strong>Develop Continuity Plan -</strong> What is the plan for ensuring stable operations using API.</li>
<li><strong>Develop Exit Plan -</strong> How will I severe a relationship and replace or deprecate need.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes I do not have everything in order before I pull the trigger. I may not completely though through what I will do when an API goes away, but I like at least having some notes written down about my frame of mind when I was integrating with any API. Having the checklist to think about at the time of integration and purchase, as well as my notes about evaluation around a vendor provides me with something I can revisit each month when paying the bill, or may as I encounter a new service, or possibly instability or lack of access to an API.</p>
<p>I am using this as part of my own API operations, but I'm also helping a client think through their API purchasing decisions, and hopefully, make the process a much healthier and educated one. I'm hoping this helps put much of the burden of API stability on the shoulders of us people who are actually making the decision, allowing us to be more mindful of who we integrate with, and set more informed and honest expectations around what APIs do, and where some of the current business models in place might help, or hurt our plans.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 May 2017</span>
        <p><a href="http://facebook.stack.network/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/the_facebook_api_index_screenshot.png" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I learn a lot by studying APIs. One of the ways I get to know what an API does is by creating an OpenAPI for the API, which helps define all of the paths available for an API--helping me understand what is possible. After defining the API requests that are possible, ensuring there are simple descriptions for each path, I also like to make sure all the data that is being passed back and forth via an API is also defined in the OpenAPI--giving me a good snapshot of what data is stored behind an API.</p>
<p><a href="http://facebook.stack.network/">In my current Facebook API definition, there is a total of 271 paths, with 90 objects defined using 654 data points</a>. The machine-readable OpenAPI definition tells me what data is stored and transmitted, and what actions I can take involving these items. The Facebook API definition isn't complete, but it does provide me with a nice view of the Facebook Graph API landscape, and since the&nbsp;project is hosted on Github anyone can help me continue adding to and expanding on the definition, as well as the documentation and other tools I'm building on top of the definition.</p>
<p><span>There are three parts to my research: 1) to define Facebooks API operation from a technical and business perspective 2) understand which of my bits Facebook tracks about me and my business(es), and how I can take more control over these bits with the Facebook API, and 3) understand how Facebook can be orchestrated and manipulated as part of a social engineering toolbox. Facebook isn't on my list of top places I hang out online, but I grasp its magnitude, and importance to my business and my career, and our democracy--so I work to understand WTF is going on with it.</span></p>
<p>I currently post stories to Facebook from my content management system. When I blog something, if I want it on Facebook, I can schedule it, and my system posts the story using the Facebook API. I'm looking to expand this to my photos, video, and the other bits I make available online. Profiling an API like this helps me understand the wider Facebook API landscape, better understanding what is possible, but it also helps me get my personal and professional world in order when it comes to one of the most important social networks out there right now.</p>

<p>I work to develop OpenAPI definitions for 3rd party APIs because it helps me understand what is being offered by a company. Even when I'm able to autogenerate an OpenAPI for an API, or come across an existing one, I still spend time going through the finer details of what an API does, or doesn't do. I find the process to be one of the best ways to learn about an API, stopping short of actually integrating with it.</p>
<p>Over the last couple of months, I've aggregated, generated, and crafted <a href="http://openapis.org">OpenAPI</a> and <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> definitions for the top three cloud API providers out there. I wanted to be able to easily see the surface area for as many of the APIs as I could find for these three companies:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://amazon.web.services.stack.network/">Amazon</a></strong> - 2222 paths (or methods) across&nbsp;65 of the Amazon Web Services - <a href="https://github.com/api-stack/amazon-web-services/tree/master/_data">you can find the APIs.json, and OpenAPI behind in the Github repository</a>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://google.stack.network/">Google</a></strong> - 2089 paths across&nbsp;75 of the Google services I'm profiling&nbsp;- you can find <a href="https://github.com/api-stack/google/tree/master/_data">the APIs.json, and OpenAPI behind in the Github repository</a>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://microsoft.stack.network/">Microsoft</a></strong> - 2109 paths across&nbsp;41 of the Microsoft and Azure services.&nbsp;- you can <a href="https://github.com/api-stack/microsoft/tree/master/_data">find the APIs.json, and OpenAPI behind in the Github repository</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I learned a lot about all three providers in the process. I filled my notebook with stories about their approaches. I also ended up with three separate Github repositories with APIs.json&nbsp;indexed OpenAPI definitions for as many of their APIs as I could process. They are far from complete, but I feel like they paint a pretty interesting picture of the API landscape across these three tech giants.</p>
<p>So far there are 6,420 paths across&nbsp;181 individual services. I'm still working on the summary and tags for each path, which are the two most important elements for me. I think the list of 6,420 actions you can take via an API across three of the biggest cloud providers gives us a lot of insight into what these companies are up to. There are a lot of valuable resources in there, ranging from cloud to machine learning. These three projects are an going part of my <a href="http://theapistack.com">API stack</a> research, and I will be adding to them as I have time. I'm looking to keep developing simple JavaScript and Liquid tooling on top of the repos, and YAML data behind--further helping me make sense of Amazon, Google, and Microsoft APIs.&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">01 May 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/tool/openapi-spec.png" alt="" width="30%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I am working to update <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/05/01/quantifying-the-api-landscape-across-amazon-google-and-microsoft/">my OpenAPI definitions for AWS, Google, and Microsoft</a> using some other OpenAPIs I've discovered on Github. When a new OpenAPI has entirely new paths available, I just insert them, but when it has an existing path I have to think more critically about what is next. Sometimes I dismiss the metadata about the API path as incomplete or lower quality than the one I have already. Other times the content is actually more superior than mine, and I incorporate it into my work. Now I'm also finding that in some cases I want to keep my representation, as well as the one I discovered, side by side--both having value.</p>
<p>This is one reason I'm not 100% sold on the fact that just API providers should be crafting their own OpenAPis--sure, the API space would be waaaaaay better if <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ALL API providers had machine readable OpenAPIs for all their services</span>, but I would want it to end here. You see, API providers are good (sometimes) at defining what their API does, but they often suck at telling you what is possible--which is why they are doing APIs. I have a lot of people who push back on me creating OpenAPIs for popular APIs, telling me that API providers should be the ones doing the hard work, otherwise it doesn't matter. I'm just not sold that this is the case, and there is an opportunity for evolving the definition&nbsp;of an API by external entities using OpenAPI.</p>
<p>To help me explore this idea, and push the boundaries of how I use OpenAPI in my API storytelling, I wanted to frame this in the context of the Amazon EC2 API, which allows me to deploy a single unit of compute into the cloud using an API, a pretty fundamental component of our digital worlds. To make any call against the Amazon EC2 I send all my calls to a single base URL:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><code><em>ec2.amazonaws.com</em></code></p>
<p>With this API call I pass in the "action" I'd like to be taken:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><code><em>?Action=RunInstances</em></code></p>
<p>Along with this base action parameter, I pass in a handful of other parameters to further define things:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><code><em>&amp;ImageId=ami-60a54009&amp;MaxCount=1&amp;KeyName=my-key-pair&amp;Placement.AvailabilityZone=us-east-1d</em></code></p>
<p>Amazon has never been known for superior API design, but it gets the job done. With this single API call I can launch a server in the clouds. When I was first able to do this with APIs, is when the light really went on in my head regarding the potential of APIs. However, back to my story on expressing what an API does, as well as what is possible using OpenAPI. AWS has done an OK job at expressing what Amazon EC2 API does, however they suck at expressing what is possible. This is where API consumers like me step up with OpenAPI and provide some alternative representations of what is possible with the highly valuable API.</p>
<p>When I define the Amazon EC2 API using the OpenAPI specification I use the following:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><code><em> swagger: '2.0'<br />info:<br />title: Amazon EC2<br />host: ec2.amazonaws.com<br />paths:<br />/:<br /><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</em>get:<br /><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</em><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</em>summary: The Amazon EC2 service<br /><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</em><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;o</em>perationId: ec2API<br /> <em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</em>parameters:<br /><em>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</em><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</em>- in: query<br /> <em>&nbsp; &nbsp; </em><em>&nbsp;</em><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</em>name: action<br /> </em></code></p>
<p>The AWS API design pattern doesn't lend itself to reuse&nbsp;when it comes to documentation and storytelling, but I'm always looking for an opportunity to push the boundaries, and I'm able to better outline all available actions, as individual API paths by appending the action parameter to the path:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><code><em> swagger: '2.0'<br />info:<br />title: Amazon EC2<br />host: ec2.amazonaws.com<br />paths:<br />/<em>?Action=RunInstances</em>/:<br /><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</em>get:<br /><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</em><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</em>summary: Run a new Amazon EC2 instance<br /><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</em><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;o</em>perationId: runInstance</em></code></p>
<p>Now I'm able to describe <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_Operations.html">all 228 actions you can take with the single Amazon EC2 API path</a> as separate paths in any OpenAPI generated API documentation and tooling. I can give them unique summaries, descriptions, and operationId. OpenAPI allows me to describe what is possible with an API, going well beyond what the API provider was able to define. I've been using this approach to better quantify the surface area of APIs like Amazon, Flickr, and others who use this pattern for a while now, but as I was looking to update my work, I wanted to take this concept even further.</p>
<p>While appending query parameters to the path definition has allowed me to expand how I describe the surface area of an API using OpenAPI, I'd rather keep these parameters defined properly using the OpenAPI specification, and define an alternative way to make the path unique. To do this, I am exploring the usage of #bookmarks, to help make duplicate API paths more unqiue in the eyes of the schema validators, but invisible to the server side of things--something like this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>swagger: '2.0'<br />info:<br />title: Amazon EC2<br />host: ec2.amazonaws.com<br />paths:<br />/#RunInstance/:<br /><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</em>get:<br /><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</em><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</em>summary: Run a new Amazon EC2 instance<br /><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</em><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;o</em>perationId: runInstance<br /></em><em><em><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>&nbsp; parameters:<br /></em></em><em><em><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- in: query<br /></em></em><em><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;name: action<br /><em><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;default: <em><em>RunInstances</em></em></em></em>&nbsp;</em></em></p>
<p>I am considering how we can further make the path unique, by predefining other parameters using default or enum:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>swagger: '2.0'<br />info:<br />title: Amazon EC2<br />host: ec2.amazonaws.com<br />paths:<br />/#RunWebSiteInstance/:<br /><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</em>get:<br /><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</em><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</em>summary: Run a new Amazon EC2 website instance<br /><em><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</em><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</em>description: The ability to launch a new website running on its own Amazon EC2 instance, from a predefined AWS AMI.&nbsp;</em><br /><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</em><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;o</em>perationId: runWebServerInstance<br /></em><em><em><span> </span>&nbsp; parameters:<br /></em></em><em><em><span> </span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- in: query<br /></em></em><em><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;name: action<br /><em><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;default:&nbsp;<em><em>RunInstances</em></em></em></em></em></em>&nbsp;<br /><em><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- in: query<br /></em></em><em><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;name: <em>ImageId</em><br /><em><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;default:&nbsp;<em><em><em>ami-60a54009</em></em></em></em></em></em></em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am still drawing&nbsp;in the lines of what the API provider has given me, but I'm now augmenting with a better summary and description of what is possible using OpenAPI, which can now be reflected in documentation and other tooling that is OpenAPI compliant. I can even prepopulate the default values, or available options using enum settings, tailoring to my team, company, or other specific needs. Taking an existing API definition beyond its provider interpretation of what it does, and getting to work on being more creative around what is possible.</p>
<p>Let me know how incoherent this is. I can't tell sometimes. Maybe I need more examples of this in action. I feel like it might be a big piece of the puzzle that has been missing for me regarding how we tell stories about what is possible with APIs. When it comes to API definitions, documentation, and discovery I feel like we are chained to a provider's definition of what is possible, when in reality this shouldn't be what drives the conversation. There should be definitions, documentation, and discovery documents created by API providers that help articulate what an API does, but more importantly, there should be a wealth of&nbsp;definitions, documentation, and discovery documents created by API consumers that help articulate what is possible.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many of the problems that APIs are often associated with API adoption can often be mitigated via more communication. I track on a number of ways the <a href="http://communications.apievangelist.com/">successful API providers are communicating around their API efforts</a>, but I also like it when API designers and architects communicate through the actual technical design of their APIs. One example of this can be found&nbsp;in the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wilde-sunset-header-02">IETF draft submission for The Sunset HTTP Header</a>, by Erik Wilde.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"This specification defines the Sunset HTTP response header field, which indicates that a URI is likely to become unresponsive at a specified point in the future."</em></p>
<p>In his original post, <a href="http://dret.typepad.com/dretblog/2015/08/http-sunset-header.html">nothing lasts Forever (and some things disappear according to a schedule)</a>, Erik shows us that a little bit of embedded communication like this in the design of our APIs can help make API consumers more in tune with what is going on. It is tough to get people's attention sometimes, and I think sometimes when us engineers are heads down in the code we tune out the regular channels, and baking things in the request and response structure of the API can help out a lot.</p>
<p>I like the concept of baking API communication and literacy into our operations through good API design. This is one aspect of hypermedia API design that I think often gets overlooked by the haterz. I'll keep adding these little building blocks to <a href="http://communications.apievangelist.com/">my API communications research</a>, helping develop ways we can better communicate with our API consumers through our API design--in real time.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/bw_website_scrape.png" alt="" width="30%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was firing up<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/04/13/formalizing-my-approach-to-identifying-the-low-hanging-api-fruit/"> my low hanging fruit engine</a> for a customer today, pulling down their entire website, giving them suggestions on where they should start with their API efforts, so I felt it was a good time to blog about this process again. Getting started with APIs can be a challenging question for some organizations, especially when they don't have executive and/or IT buy-in to the concept. To assist folks who find themselves in this situation, I have a process which I call "low-hanging fruit", designed to help jumpstart the API conversation in a safer way.</p>
<p>When someone approaches me with the question: Where do I start with APIs at our company, organization, institution, or government agency? If they do not have a specific project in mind or have the buy-in of IT yet, I always recommend started with the low hanging fruit on your website, and targeting these four areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Existing Spreadsheets </strong>- If you there is a CSV, Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet, or Google sheet on the public website, it should be available as an API for searching, and usage in other applications.</li>
<li><strong>Existing Data Files -</strong> If there are existing XML, JSON, or other machine-readable data files already available on the public website, they should be available as an API for searching, versioning, and usage in other applications.</li>
<li><strong>Existing Tables</strong> - Any page that has a table over 25 rows should be reviewed, and consider for publishing as a simple API, for use in all applications.</li>
<li><strong>Existing Forms -</strong> Any page that has a form should be reviewed, and consider for publishing the content available within as a&nbsp;simple API, for use&nbsp;in all applications.</li>
</ul>
<p>Begin here. Target these four areas across your websites. Identify the data source. See if you can get access to the source. If not, scrape the data. Either way, get the data published as a simple API. As soon as you launch your first API, make sure you also <a href="http://portal.minimum.apievangelist.com/">publish a basic API portal on Github, using Github pages</a>, and publish your first API there. Get to work on additional APIs, and repeat until you have a robust catalog of APIs in your developer portal. Get to work evolving each API, improving how it acquires and delivers its data, and develop new types of applications and partnerships around the data you've made available. #repeat</p>
<p>The data and content available on your public website have two important characteristics: 1) it has already passed legal and approved for being available publicly, and 2) there is a value in it being made available, as it's already on the public website for a reason. Learn about APIs and the API life cycle within this process. Practice. Grow. Learn. Low hanging fruit gives you a simple, safe place to begin your API journey, learning how it all works in an environment that will be more forgiving when you make mistakes, and hopefully will provide some pretty useful solutions that you can use to demonstrate the value of doing APIs at your company, organization, institution, or government agency.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Apr 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/bw_software_usage.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>When I get asked by folks about where they should start with APIs, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/04/28/where-do-i-start-with-apis-your-website/">I always start with the low hanging fruit on their websites</a>--if it is publicly available as HTML on your website, it should be available as JSON or YAML via an API. After that, I recommend people start with the software and systems a company is already using and might have APIs or data outputs. Your existing technology most likely has APIs or the ability to publish machine-readable data, and you are just not taking advantage of their capabilities as part of any larger API strategy.</p>
<p>I recommend launching a new developer portal using Github&nbsp;and get to work inventorying all of the software, systems, website, and services you use. It doesn't have to be public, you can make your repository private if you have any concerns. Profile each of the technological solutions you are using on a regular basis, and see if it has an API or not. If it doesn't, why the hell are you using it? Ok, well maybe that is another discussion. If it has an API, add it to your API list, and set it aside for profiling in more detail, developing a better understanding what is possible.</p>
<p>After reviewing&nbsp;all your existing software, and now possessing a list of companies who do have APIs, let's get to work profiling them, and bring together into a coherent 3rd party API strategy for your operations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Developer Portal -</strong> Where do we find documentation and other resources for each API?</li>
<li><strong>Pay for Service -</strong> Are we paying for a service? What are the pricing and plans for each API?</li>
<li><strong>Documentation -</strong> Where is the API documentation for each API we are including in our catalog?</li>
<li><strong>OpenAPI Definition - </strong>Create or obtain an OpenAPI definition for each API, allowing it to be used in operations.</li>
<li><strong>Support Information -</strong> Where do we get support for an API? Are there multiple options, or possibly paid solutions?</li>
<li><strong>Road Map &amp; Change Log -</strong> Where do we find the roadmap, status, change log, and other aspects of API operations?</li>
<li><strong>Code &amp; SDKs </strong>- Where do we find code and other open tools for an API? Which are forked, copied, or implemented for our operations?</li>
<li><strong>iPaaS Solutions -</strong> Can we identify and share common integration patterns, and put to use services like Zapier as part of our operations?</li>
</ul>
<p>APIs are not just about providing APIs, it is also about consuming APIs. Google Apps, SalesForce, Office 365, and many of the software solutions you are already putting to work have APIs. There should be a single portal you can go to and understand what is possible when it comes to APIs You should be able to find code, tools, and communication around existing usage, integration, and other projects at your company. API portals are often confused as something you do for a single API, providing direct access to data, content, and algorithms, but there is no reason a portal can't also contain access to other 3rd party APIs that also benefit your operations.</p>
<p>The public or private API portal for your company, organization, institution, or government agency doesn't have to only possess your APIs. It makes perfect sense for you to aggregate the APIs from across the software solutions you use, cultivating a central place to find everything regarding 3rd party API integration at your company. In addition to low hanging fruit, it provides a great way to kick off an API effort at your company, focusing on the digital resources that are already being used, allowing you to learn more about an API way of life&nbsp;before you consider tackling more complicated API efforts.</p>

<p>Us API Evangelists have a super secret Slack group where we talk about super interesting API Evangelist things, and one of the folks I regularly learn from in this group is James Higginbotham (<a href="https://twitter.com/launchany">@launchany</a>). James is a highly skilled enterprise API architect and curator of <a href="http://launchany.us2.list-manage1.com/subscribe?u=5005148108dfbac726f74e31e&amp;id=239e48d26e">the popular API Developer Weekly email newslette</a>r. James is always dropping wisdom in the group, but I found a recent API lifecycle list to be particularly worth sharing, as many of my readers are looking to bring some coherence to their own API operations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify Desired Outcome (maps to Discover)</li>
<li>Assess Capabilities Required to Satisfy the Need (activities to achieve the outcome)</li>
<li>Capture Actors/Participants Using the Capabilities to Achieve the Outcomes (activity steps)</li>
<li>Determine Capability Gaps (what don't I have yet, along with what I have - might be various 3rd parties to fill the need)</li>
<li>Find Capability Boundaries (when the problem space is larger than a bounded context for a team, line of business, or some other appropriate boundary)</li>
<li>Identify API Resources</li>
<li>Design API Resource Lifecycle (endpoints that will be offered, to whom)</li>
<li>Document the API Design (OpenAPI, Landing Page for a developer portal section, etc)</li>
<li>Consume the API Design using a mock</li>
<li>Development/Automated Testing</li>
<li>Deploy/Manage/Monitor/Market/Evangelize/Improve/Support</li>
</ul>
<p>It is a short, but powerful way to look at your life cycle, which often means many different things to many different folks. I particularly like how much focus he puts on the solutions brought to the table, as well as thinking about the realities of actually getting the work done. I come across a lot of companies who know they want APIs but don't have any real plan for getting there, beyond just putting a developer on it. I'm keeping his list handy, augmenting my own, and use to help folks developer their own, custom API lifecycle flow.</p>

<p><em>This is a multipart story on monetizing public data using APIs. I have&nbsp;</em>spent<em>&nbsp;the last seven years studying over 75+ aspects of the API delivery&nbsp;</em>lifecycle<em>&nbsp;across companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies. This project is designed to be a distillation of my work to help drive a conversation around sensible and&nbsp;</em>pragmatic<em>&nbsp;revenue generation using public data--allowing the&nbsp;</em>city<em>, county, state, and federal government agencies to think critically about how open data efforts can exist and grow. It lives as a standalone repository, as well as individual stories that are meant to stand on their own, while also contributing to an overall narrative about public data monetization.</em></p>
<p>While my primary income is not derived from developing software for sale, I have developed commercial software throughout my career, and actively maintain my own API driven technology platform for tracking on the API industry. This is my best attempt to put on my technology vendor hat on for a bit to better understand the concerns and perspective of the software vendors involved with the public data sector. There is a wide spectrum of technology vendors servicing the space, making this exercise difficult to generalize, but I wanted to take a shot at defending and jumpstarting the conversation at the commercial vendor level.</p>
<p>Commercial tech vendors are always at the frontline of discussion around monetization of public data, for better or worse. When open data activists push back on my work to understand how public data can be monetized, the most common response I have is that public data is already being monetized by commercial vendors, and my work is about shining a light on this, and not being in denial that it is already occurring everywhere. Here are some of my thoughts from the public data commercial vendor landscape:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investment In Data -</strong>&nbsp;As a technology company I am investing a significant amount of resources into our data, and the data of our customers. While views may greatly vary on how much ownership platform and technology operators have around the public data they touch, it can't be argued that commercial vendors play a significant role--the discussion should be more about how great of a role, and how much ownership is there.</li>
<li><strong>Investment in Software&nbsp;</strong>- Beyond the data, we are investing a significant amount of resources into software, that our customers use, and we use to manage our business internally. This is where we will keep most of the proprietary value generated around public data, although the door around the availability of open source tooling needs to remain open. Similar to data, the question is about how much ownership over software do I need as a commercial vendor and how much can I give back to the community.</li>
<li><strong>Lead Generation -</strong>&nbsp;I am interested in generating leads for new customers, and joining in new conversations that demonstrate the value of the products and services that my company brings to the table.</li>
<li><strong>Sell My Services -&nbsp;</strong>I am interested in selling my products and services, and my motivation is going to reflect this. No matter what our mission or marketing may say, I'm interested in generating a profit for my company, and its interests.</li>
<li><strong>Premium Services -</strong>&nbsp;Our domain expertise, and investment in data and software opens up the opportunity for us to offer premium services on top of public data operations. While our customers may not always pay directly for data storage and management, or even software licenses, the ability to sell premium services is valuable to everyone involved.</li>
<li><strong>Protect Intellectual Property -</strong>&nbsp;It is important to us that our intellectual property is protected in all conversations, and that the licensing of data and software is respected, and reflected in our partnerships. While perspectives on what is appropriate regarding intellectual property will vary, it is important that IP Is always an up-front part of the conversation.</li>
<li><strong>Investment in R&amp;D -&nbsp;</strong>Commercial vendors are more likely to invest in research and development, helping push forward innovation around public data, something that isn't always possible unless there are clear revenue opportunities for commercial operators and clear communication and understanding with non-commercial stakeholders about what is possible, and being done.</li>
<li><strong>Consistent Support -&nbsp;</strong>One important thing commercial vendors bring to the table for government agencies, and non-commercial stakeholders are the opportunity for consistent support. As seasons change in government, commercial vendors can be there to fill gaps in business and technical support services, keeping important conversations moving forward.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have to be 100% transparent here and stop to say that while I am advocating for revenue generation around public data, I'm not always a proponent of that revenue benefitting commercial interests. First, and foremost, I want revenue to benefit the public, secondarily the non-commercial stakeholders, then thirdly for the benefit commercial vendors. Making this argument from the commercial vendor perspective is possible for me, just not something I'm always going to be in full support of, and I will always insist on pushing back on aggressive behavior from commercial vendors to dominate the conversation, in favor of data stewards, and the public.</p>
<p>With that said, I'm a believer that commercial activity can benefit public data efforts. Sensible revenue can be generated from delivering services, products, and tooling developed around public data, while also investing back into data operators, owners, and stewards, and most importantly benefit those being served. Depending on where you operate in the public data space you will see this argument, or hopefully conversation, differently. This is just an attempt to look at things from the side of commercial vendors, and being honest and transparent about what the commercial interests are when it comes to public data.</p>

<p>Continuing a growing number of command line interfaces (CLI) being deployed side by side with APIs, <a href="https://apimatic.io/blog/post/introducing-api-matic-cli">SDK generation provider APIMATIC just released a CLI for their platform</a>, continuing their march towards being a continuous&nbsp;integration provider. There was <a href="http://nordicapis.com/the-return-of-the-cli-clis-being-used-by-api-related-companies/">a great post the other day on Nordic APIs about CLI</a>, highlighting one way API providers seem to be investing in CLIs to help increase the chances that their services will get baked into applications and system integrations.</p>
<p><em>"APIMatic CLI is a command line tool written in Python which serves as a wrapper over our own Python SDK. It is available in the form of a small windows executable so you can easily plug it into your build cycle. You no longer have to write your own code or set up a development environment for the consumption of our APIs."</em></p>
<p><span>SDK generation, API validation and API transformation baked into your workflow, all driven by API definitions available via any URL. This is a pretty important layer of your API lifecycle, something that isn't easily done if you are still battling the monolith system, but when you've gone full microservices, DevOps, Continous Integration Kung Fu (tm), it provides you with a pretty easy way to define, deploy, and validate API endpoints, as well as the system integrations that consume those APIs--all driven and choreographed by your API definitions.</span></p>
<p>I'm still very API-centric in my workflows and use the APIMATIC API to generate SDKs, and API Transformer to translate API definitions from one format to the other, but I understand that a CLI is more practical for the way some teams operate. API service providers seem to be getting the message and responding to developers with a fully functional CLI, as well as API&nbsp;like Zapier did the other day with the release of their CLI--<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/04/20/continous-integration-platform-as-a-service-at-the-command-line/">pushing the boundaries of what is a continuous integration platform as a service</a>.</p>
<p>I asked Adeel of APIMATIC when they would have a CLI generator based upon API definitions. I mean their&nbsp;CLI is a tool that wraps the APIMATIC SDK, which I assume is generated by APIMATIC, using an API definition. Why can't they just autogenerate a CLI for their customers using the same API definition being used to generated the SDK? He responded with a smile. ;-)</p>

<p>I talk to a lot of API service and tooling providers about API definitions. I've long been an advocate for API service providers supporting OpenAPI, as well as a variety of API definition formats--if you are having trouble doing this, check out <a href="https://apimatic.io/transformer">API Transformer</a>. While service providers are an important link in the API definition chain, support of API specification by API providers themselves, and the availability of definitions for all of their APIs is another very critical link in this API supply chain.</p>
<p>During a discussion with an iPaaS provider this week about the availability of OpenAPI definitions, a comment was made about there not being enough good sources of usable definitions, specifically from API providers themselves. While it is true, and there is not as much adoption by leading API providers as I would like to see, it still is pretty easy to find numerous proactive efforts by APIs providers like <a href="https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-oai">SendGrid</a>, <a href="https://github.com/NYTimes/public_api_specs">NY Times</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs">Azure</a>-- just to name a few. Of course, I want ALL API providers to maintain an accurate, comprehensive set of API definitions for the operations, but I don't think is the reality we live in, or even where all API definition creation should occur.</p>
<p>It is part of the API DNA for the lion share of the innovation to come from external sources. Sure, I think every API provider would be better off if they maintained their own OpenAPI, generating documentation, code, and other resources. But, I also think it is perfectly acceptable for the community to do some of this heavy lifting. Not all API providers are going to have the skills, time, and other resources to make this happen--often times this is precisely why they are doing APIs, to outsource, and share the innovation load.</p>
<p>I see API <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com">definitions</a> and <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">discovery</a> as a community thing, something API providers, consumers, as well as API service providers should all be contributing to. No matter where you operate in the space, you should be sharing your API definitions using Github, even if they are for the 3rd party API providers you depend on and might seem duplicative. You never know when your definition might have a piece of the puzzle, another developer is looking for, allowing them to build on top of your existing work, and vice versa. When you define your APIs out in the open like this, we all win, because API definitions benefit the API provider, consumer, services, and tooling&nbsp;developers.</p>

<p>One of the areas of the API sector I've been pretty critical of service providers is in the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/18/continuing-my-struggle-for-reciprocity-as-etl-evolves-into-the-cloud-as-ipaas/">area of integration platform as a service, or iPaaS</a>.

<p>Because of my stance on IFTTT, I've always chosen to support <a href="http://zapier.com">the Zapier team</a>, who are in direct competition with IFTTT, but they also have an API for developing, deploying and managing your platform integrations. My only critique of Zapier has long been that they don't have an API that lets me get at their catalog of API integrations, and workflows (zaps). I'm sure Wade Foster, Zapier's CEO is sick of hearing me complain about this, and I have to finally quit my complaining <a href="https://zapier.com/engineering/partner-api/">because they have released the Zapier Partner API</a>, which is exactly the API I wanted--minus one little detail.</p>
<p><a href="https://zapier.com/developer/documentation/v2/zap-templates-for-partners-api/">The Zapier Partner API is not available to everyone</a>, it is as it is named, a "partner API". Meaning I cannot just sign up and get access to the catalog without first being a partner. The open API developer activist in me yells, "WTF, this should be an open API!!--This is not fair!!". Then I stop and think about the realities of doing APIs on the web, today open to the public, with a valuable resource like the catalog of over 750 API integrations that Zapier possesses, and I say "whoooaaa&nbsp;to my high horse", and step off it for a moment, and standing firmly on the ground, I have to admit their approach to releasing the partner API is pretty smart.</p>
<p>To use the API you have to have built a Zapier App, and become a partner--you have to have skin in the game. Then you don't just get access to see the entire catalog, you get to see any side of the pyramid that your application touches, and has contributed value to. When this requirement is met, you get some pretty interesting visibility into not just the catalog, but also the usage of your application in relationship to the catalog. Boys and girls, this is how you keep freeloading, opinionated open API developer activist types like myself from being a burden on the system. Open APIs are a nice fantasy, but in reality, when you are running a business, you actually have to be a little smarter about things than I am capable of.</p>
<p>So, I look forward to shutting my mouth. Stop complaining about Zapier's approach, and get to work on my Zapier App. I'm hoping it will be something worthy enough and can contribute significantly to Zapier's iPaaS platform so that I can be considered a partner. Now I have no reason to not hold up Zapier as a shining example of how you can do integration platform as a service (iPaaS) in a way that makes money, benefits API providers, as well as end users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nice work Zapier--I'm impressed with your savvy approach to delivering this API.&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">26 Apr 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/restlet_api_design_studio.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" />I am on a quest to help improve and standardize the available <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/tools/">API design tooling</a> out there, and one aspect of doing this is spending time highlighting the API service providers who have interesting approaches to design embedded in their service.</p>
<p>Top of my list is <a href="https://studio.restlet.com">Restlet with their studio</a>. There are a couple of things going on in <a href="https://studio.restlet.com">Restlet Studio</a> that I think are significant to the API design conversation, and would like to see become commonplace across service providers, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/08/13/a-common-open-source-api-design-editor-is-needed-for-api-service-providers/">possibly even part of some sort of open source offering</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://studio.restlet.com">Restlet Studio</a> has a nice human interface for designing APIs. When you load up an API you are given a simple, clean, yet comprehensive&nbsp;user interface for adding and updating API paths, and other finer details of your design, no developer skills necessary--allowing anyone to step up and help define the API contract.</p>
<p>Next, when you look at the bottom of your API design in Restlet Studio you are given a design, OpenAPI 2.0, and RAML 1.0 view of your API, allowing you to switch from user interface to a machine-readable definition of the API contract in two leading formats. This API contract will continue to define your API at every stop along the life cycle, and it significantly helps that this contract is human readable in YAML and Markdown. All API design editors should abstract away as much&nbsp;as they possibly can regarding transformations between API definition formats (use the&nbsp;<a href="https://apimatic.io/transformer">API Transformer API</a>).</p>
<p>I like Restlet's simple approach to delivering design tooling at the center of their platform. I'm keeping an eye on a variety of service providers who are innovating in this way, providing usable tooling when it comes to API design. If you are looking for other examples of this in the wild, take a look at <a href="https://apimatic.io">APIMATIC</a> or <a href="http://stoplight.io/">Stoplight</a>--they are both designing high-quality API design interfaces and tooling. When crafting your own API design user interfaces make sure you take the time to study what is already out there, so that you are building on the best practices are in use, and not just reinventing the wheel when it comes to API design.</p>
<p><strong>Disclosure:</strong> I am an advisor to <a href="https://apimatic.io">APIMATIC</a>, and <a href="http://restlet.com">Restlet</a> is my partner.</p>

        <span class="post-date">26 Apr 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/data_steward.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p><em>This is a multipart story on monetizing public data using APIs. I have&nbsp;</em>spent<em>&nbsp;the last seven years studying over 75+ aspects of the API delivery&nbsp;</em>lifecycle<em>&nbsp;across companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies. This project is designed to be a distillation of my work to help drive a conversation around sensible and&nbsp;</em>pragmatic<em>&nbsp;revenue generation using public data--allowing the </em>city<em>, county, state, and federal government agencies to think critically about how open data efforts can exist and grow. It lives as a standalone repository, as well as individual stories that are meant to stand on their own, while also contributing to an overall narrative about public data monetization.</em></p>
<p>I am a database person. I have had a professional career working with databases since 1987 when I began working with COBOL databases as part of student information systems in the State of Oregon. After the Internet became a thing in 1996 I began to architect a variety of database driven web applications. Ten years later, as the cloud began to form, I began architecting distributed data-driven systems using web technology, aka APIs. I understand data. I understand the challenges&nbsp;of being a data administrator, operator, and steward. I wanted to take this experience and awareness&nbsp;and apply it to helping data operators and stewards become more successful when it comes to achieving their mission.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of this exercise, I wanted to put on my data steward hat for a few, and think about my needs when it comes to monetization of my data. While this project is focused on the monetization of public data, in reality, much of the logic can also be applied to any type of data, it just depends on your view of the data landscape--here is what comes to mind:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hard Work&nbsp;</strong>- I have invested a lot of time and resources into my data. This wasn't just a one-time thing. I am perpetually investing in my data, and I would like to see this reflected and respected in all partner engagements I have, wherever my data is used.</li>
<li><strong>Hard Costs -</strong>&nbsp;There are hard costs involved with managing my data, including storage,&nbsp;compute,&nbsp;and bandwidth charges. These costs are a big concern for me as a small business operator, and something that will only increase as my data&nbsp;expands,&nbsp;evolves,&nbsp;and is consumed by a larger audience.</li>
<li><strong>Quality Control -&nbsp;</strong>I am extremely concerned about the quality of data, and my process, domain expertise, and overall experience contribute significantly to the quality of my data, and its value to my partners, and the general public.</li>
<li><strong>Provenance -</strong>&nbsp;Where data comes from is important to me. I keep track of all the sources of where my data comes from. I keep a detailed log of the provenance of data as it is acquired, and ingested into any system. I expect my partners to respect this practice.</li>
<li><strong>Accessibility</strong>&nbsp;- It is important that my data is accessible to all key stakeholders. I want to have a master list of all stakeholders, and ensure frictionless access to exactly the data I want them to have, and nothing more. I want to be able to allow and revoke access as I see fit.</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong>&nbsp;- It is vital that all data is secured in storage, in transport, and across partner systems. Security should be built into all aspects of my data life cycle, and something that is easily explained to partners and can be measured and reported upon.</li>
<li><strong>Revenue&nbsp;</strong>- I want to be able to generate revenue to invest back into the acquisition, development, and management of my data resource. It costs money to do what I do, resulting in an extremely valuable resource that is desirable by a large audience--I should be able to derive revenue from this when it is ethical and makes sense, especially when it comes to engaging with other commercial entities.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am sure there a number of concerns for data administrators, operators, and stewards from different sectors, but generally speaking, as a data steward, these are the top concerns for me. Whether I'm working in a small business, large enterprise, organization, institution, or government agency, these are going to be some of my most immediate concerns. No matter how my budget works, I'm going to need a way to quantify the direct and indirect costs, and translate this to some value to someone--being able to generate sensible revenue is an important part of making sure data is 1) accessible, but also 2) continues to deliver value to all stakeholders at the table.</p>
<p>This is just one component in a larger argument about generating revenue from public data using APIs, but when we are talking about publicly available data, most conversations are&nbsp;going, to begin with, and continue to focus on the data operator or steward. I choose to label my role as a&nbsp;data steward, over user the phrase data operator, because I usually have a personal stake in the data I'm managing--it is just the way I do business. This isn't always the case, but in my experience, when someone cares about the data they are managing, the quality is always better, and the value significantly increases, deserving a separate descriptor.</p>
<p>This post is crafted while thinking about my own data projects, ranging from my data driven&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>&nbsp;research to my&nbsp;<a href="http://adopta.agency">Adopta&nbsp;Agency</a>&nbsp;work. I depend on data to operate my business. I also depend on other data providers to operate my business. Some of these data providers are government agencies who are severely underfunded, and I want them to be more successful in what they do, and generate the revenue they need to meet their objectives, but also stay in operation for my own selfish needs. Much like minerals, water, and trees on public lands, there is a lot of value in the public data resources out there, and this is just an exercise to open up an honest discussion around how we might possibly generate revenue from public data.</p>

        <span class="post-date">25 Apr 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/saas"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/announcing_multi_year_contracts_for_saas_and_apis.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I have been talking about selling wholesale APIs for some time now, allowing your potential customers to pick and choose exactly the API infrastructure they need, and develop their own virtualized API stacks. I'm not talking about publishing your retail API into marketplaces like Mashpe, I'm talking about making your API deployable and manageable on all the major cloud providers.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/saas">You see this shift in business with a recent AWS email I got telling me about multi-year contracs for SaaS and APIs</a>. Right now there are&nbsp;<span>70 SaaS products on AWS Marketplace, but from the email I can tell that Amazon is really trying to expand it's API offerings as well. When you deploy an API solution using the AWS Marketplace, and a customer signs up for a one, two, or three year contract, they don't pay for the underlying AWS infrastructure, just for the SaaS, or API solution. I will have to expore more to see if this is just absorbed by the API operator, or AWS working to incentivize this type of wholesale API deployment in their marketplace, and locking in providers and consumers.</span></p>
<p>I'm still learning about how Amazon is shifting the landscpe for deploying and managing APIs in this wholesale, almost API broker type of way. I recently came across <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/02/28/the-aws-serverless-api-portal/">the AWS Serverless API Portal</a>, which is meant to augment the delivery of SaaS or API solutions in this way. With this model you could be in the business of deploying API developer portals for companies, and fill ingthe catalog with a variety of wholesale API resources, from a varietiy of providers--opening up a pretty interesting opportunity for white label APIs, and API brokers.</p>
<p>As I'm studying this new approach to deploying and managing APIs using marketplaces like this, I'm also noticing a shift towards deliving more algorithmic APIs, with machine learning, artificial intelligence, and other voodoo as the engine--resulting in a shift towards&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/03/13/lots-of-talk-about-machine-learning-marketplaces/">machine learning API marketplaces</a>. I really need to carve off time to think about API deployment and management in this way. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/04/20/human-service-apis-on-aws-azure-google-and-heroku/">I've already begun looking at what it takes to deploy bare bones, wholesale APIs using AWS, Google, Heroku, or Azure clouds,</a> but I really haven't invested much in the business side of all of this, soewhere Amazon seems to be slightly ahead of the curve in.</p>

        <span class="post-date">25 Apr 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/tools/visual-studio/docs/find-library"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/google_visual_studio_ide_apidiscovery.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm always learning from the API pioneers, and trying to understand how they are pushing forward the API conversation. I'm neck deep in <a href="http://amazon.web.services.stack.network/">profiling AWS APIs</a>, as well as G<a href="http://google.stack.network/">oogle APIs</a>. One common pattern I'm seeing across both providers is the support for API access in both Visual Studio and Eclipse IDEs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Google is helping developers find APIs within both of the leading IDE platforms. They have long had some <a href="ttps://cloud.google.com/eclipse/docs/">Eclipse plugins for their API infrastructure</a>, but I recently noticed&nbsp;<a href="https://cloud.google.com/tools/visual-studio/docs/find-library">they also have a pretty robust solution for Visual Studio developers</a>. The Google APIs .NET library is made available in Visual Studio using the&nbsp;<span>NuGet package manager, opening up access to a significant portion of their API stack.</span></p>
<p>Amazon also provides <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/awstoolkiteclipse/">Eclipse</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/awstoolkitvisualstudio/">Visual Studio</a> tooling as part of their&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/tools/">AWS toolbox</a>. Opening up access the AWS API catalog to developers in the IDE they are are using to build their applications and craft their system integrations. I don't know how much time you've spent looking through the AWS catalog, but it can be a timesucker--giving me access to APIs in my native environment makes a lot sense.</p>
<p>I feel like API innovation in the IDE is right there with API integration into our continuous integration workflows, and the usage of Github. You should haven't to depend on Google to find your APIs, they should be right at your fingertips in your IDE, no matter whether they are for your applications, or for managing your API operations. All your internal, and 3rd party APIs should be baked into your development, and continuous integration environments, allowing you to orchestrate exactly the application experience, and life cycle you desire. This is just one of the fronts I'd like to see API discovery evolve in coming years, reaching developers with new APIs and paths during design and development, as well as across continuous integration stages of our work.</p>

        <span class="post-date">25 Apr 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/rate-limiting/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/api_rate_limiting_at_dns_layer_cloudflare.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/rate-limiting/">I just got an email from my DNS provider CloudFlare about rate limiting and protecting my APIs</a>. I am a big fan of CloudFlare, partly because I am a customer, and I use to manage my own infrastructure, but also partly due to the way they understand APIs, and actively use them as part of their business, products, and services.</p>
<p>Their email spans a couple areas of my research that I find interesting, and extremely relevant: 1) <a href="http://dns.apievangelist.com">DNS</a>, 2) <a href="http://security.apievangelist.com">Security</a>, 3) <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com">Management</a>. They are offering me something that is traditionally done at the API management layer (rate limiting), but now offering to do it for me at the DNS layer, expanding the value of API rate limiting into the realm of security, and specifically in defense against DDoS attacks--a serious concern.</p>
<p>Talk about an easy way to add value to my world as an API provider. One that is frictionless, because I'm already depending on them for the DNS layer of my web, and API layers of operations. All I have to do is signup for the new service, and begin dialing it in for my all of my APIs, which span multiple domains--all conveniently managed using CloudFlare.</p>
<p>Another valuable thing CloudFlare's approach does, in my opinion, is to reintroduce the concept of rate limiting to the world of websites. This helps me in my argument that companies, organizations, institutions and government agencies should be considering having APIs to alleviate website scraping. Using CloudFlare they can now rate limit the website while pointing legitimate use cases to the API where their access can be measured, metered, and even monetized when it makes sense.</p>
<p><a href="https://api.cloudflare.com/">I'm hoping that CloudFlare will be exposing all of these services via their API</a>, so that I can automate the configuration of rate limiting for my APIs at the DNS level using APIs. As I design and deploy new API endpoints I want them automatically protected at the DNS layer using CloudFlare. I don't want to have to do extra work when it comes to securing and managing web or API access. I just want a baseline for all of my operations, and when I need I can customize per specific domains, or down to the individual API path level--the rest is automated as part of my continuous integration workflows.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/04/24/the-concern-around-availability-and-reliability-of-government-apis/">THe Concern Around Availability And Reliability Of Government APIs</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">24 Apr 2017</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/epa_website_reliability.png" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p><a href="https://twitter.com/EPA/status/856508545805758464">There is some rumors circling about more government open data going way, this round is at the EPA.</a> The EPA says the data isn't going anywhere, but understandably there are some serious concerns about the availability and reliability of environmental data from federal agencies during a Trump administration. With the looming government shutdown, I'll renew some of my old arguments around how we can make government data more accessible and making a difference--thoughts I developed during the 2013 shutdown.</p>
<p><strong>Communication And Collaboration</strong><br />First and foremost, communication around API operations is essential for any kind of reliability. Too often the providers behind APIs, and even consumers of APIs are radio silent. Refusing to coorindate and communicate around the realities of API operations and integrations. I don't expect all government APIs to stay in operation for every, but I to expect all API providers to be honest and communicative about past, present, and future of API operations.</p>
<p><strong>Access To The Raw Data</strong><br />Alongside every government data API, there should be a download to the raw data behind the API. This is the best way to keep data available. Allowing developers to download and put data to use directly in their local environment, bypassing or augmenting any dependence on the API. Remember that not everyone will have the resources and skills to make this happen, so it shouldn't be instead of API, but complimenting any API, providing more complete access for those who need it. </p>
<p><strong>Use And Share A Common API Definition And Schema</strong><br />When you define and share your API using machine readable specifications like OpenAPI it has the potential to turn an single API into a common set of federated APIs, all working together for a common goal. In addition to helping generate API documentation, and code in a variety of languages, an OpenAPI for all government APIs would make them more accessible, as well as reusable.</p>
<p><strong>Cached Or Slave API Deployment</strong><br />When any API employs a common API definition and schema, as well as full datasets for download, it opens up the possibility for cached editions, or slave implementations of an API. The federal government APIs would always be a master version, but when there are outages, either temporary or permanent, the slave or cached versions of an API can help ensure websites, and applications continue operating.</p>
<p><strong>Government API Service Level Agreements (SLA)</strong><br />Make the implementation of service level agreements across federal government APIs standard practice. When any government agency prepares to launch an APIs, they should make sure a service level agreement is in place, setting expectations for the availability of the service. I'm not sure what the enforcement of this would look like, but the presence of SLAs, and the conversation they stimulate would be an important first step toward ensuring better access and availability to APIs and open data. </p>
<p><strong>Government API Deprecation Policies</strong><br />Similar to the SLA discussion, let's put the conversation around the deprecation of government APIs front and center. Let's make it standard operating procedure to have an API deprecation policy as part of ALL API operations in the federal government. There are plenty of blueprints to follow when it comes to setting deprecation policy, but mostly it is just about having the discussion around the expectations around the availability of any API and the open data behind it.</p>
<p><strong>Everything Goes Away Eventually</strong><br />There are many reasons why federal government goes away. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/10/17/shutdown-of-government-open-data-and-apis-is-not-government-services-business-as-usual/">The government shutdown in 2013 frustrated me endlessly</a>, but there are many reasons why a government API can go way, including budgetary, or even administration ideology. There are many reasons why private sector APIs go away as well. We just need to keep having discussions about the realities of doing business with APIs, and ensure there are as many layers present to help minimize the pain associated with deploying web, mobile, and other applications on top of government open data and APIs. </p>

<p>Data is power. If you have valuable data, people want it. While this is the current way of doing things on the Internet, it really isn't a new concept. The data in databases has always been wielded alongside business and political objectives. I have worked professionally as a database engineer for 30 years this year, with my first job building COBOL databases for use in schools across the State of Oregon in 1987, and have seen many different ways that data is the fuel for the engines of power.</p>
<p>Data is valuable. We put a lot of work into acquiring, creating, normalizing, updating, and maintaining our data. However, this value only goes so far if we keep it siloed, and isolated. We have to be able to open up our data to other stakeholders, partners, or possibly even the public. This is where modern approaches to APIs can help us in some meaningful ways, allowing data stewards to sensibly, and securely open up access to valuable API resources using low-cost web technology. One of the most common obstacles I see impeding companies, organizations, institutions, and agencies from achieving API success, center around restrictive views on data licensing, not being able to separate the data layers by using APIs, and being overly concerned about a loss of power when you publish APIs.</p>
<p>You worked hard to develop the data you have, but you also want to make accessible. To protect our interests I see many folks impose pretty proprietary restrictions around their data, which ends up hurting its usage and viability in partner systems, and introducing friction when it comes to accessing and putting data to work--when this is the thing you really want as a data steward. Let me take a stab at helping you reduce this friction by better understanding how APIs can help you peel the licensing onion layers back when it comes to your valuable data.</p>

<p><strong>Your Valuable Data</strong><br />This is an example point of contact record. I've worked hard to create this bit of data (not really), and maintain a relationship with this point of contact. It takes time to validate that their record is up to date, always relfecting reality in my database.</p>
<p>While openly licensed data is one important piece of the puzzle, and data should be openly licensed when it makes sense, this is the layer of this discussion you may want to be a little more controlling in who has access to, and how partners and the public are able to put your data to use in their operations.</p>
<p>In an online, always on, digital environment, you want data accessible, but to be able to do this you need to think critically about how you peel back the licensing onion when it comes to this data.</p>

<td style="text-align: left;" width="50%" align="center" valign="top">
<p><strong>The Schema For Your Data</strong><br />The first layer to peel back when you are looking to make data more accessible with APIs is at the schema level. This is the names, description, data type, and other details about the meta layer of your valuable data--it isn't the data, but the description of the structure of your data.</p>
<p>Ideally, your schema already employs predefined schemas like we find at <a href="http://schema.org">Schema.org</a>, or <a href="http://openreferral.org">Open Referral</a>. Following common definitions will significantly widen the audience for any dataset, allowing data to seamlessly be used across a variety of systems. These forms of schema or openly licensed, usually putting into the public domain.</p>
<p>The schema layer of open data can often resemble the data itself, using machine readable formats like XML, JSON, and YAML. This is most likely the biggest contributing factor for data stewards failing to see this as a separate layer of access from the data itself, and sometimes applying a restrictive license, or forgetting to license it at all.</p>
<p>Data is often more ephemeral than the schema. Ideally, schemas do not change often, are shared and resused, as well as free from restrictive licensing. For system integrations to work, and for partnerships to be sustainable, we need to speak a common language, and schema is how we describe our data so it can be put to use outside our firewall.</p>
<p>Make sure the schema for your data is well-defined, machine readable, and openly licensed for the widest possible use.</p>

<td style="text-align: left;" width="50%" align="center" valign="top">
<p><strong>Defining Access To Data Using OpenAPI&nbsp;</strong><br />The third layer of this licensing onion is the API layer, which governs access to data, defining how requests are made upon data, and how responses are structured. Many API providers are putting <a href="http://openapis.org">OpenAPI</a> to work to define this layer of data operations.</p>
<p>As with the schema layer of data operations, you are hoping that other companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies will integrate this layer into their operations. This layer is much more permanent than the ephermeral data layer, and should be well defined, ideally sharing common patterns, and free from restrictive licensing.</p>
<p>Per the Oracle v Google Java API copyright case in the United States, the API layer is subject to copyright enforcement, meaning the naming, ordering of the surface area of your API can be copyright. If you are looking for others to comfortably integrate this definition into their operations, it should be openly licensed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The API layer is not your data. It defines how data will be accessed, and put to use. It is important to separate this layer of your data operations, allowing it to shared, reused, and implemented in many different ways supporting web, mobile, voice, bot, and a growing number of API driven applications.</p>
<p>Make sure the API layer to data operations is well-defined, machine readable, and free from restrictive licensing when possible.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Currently, many data providers I talk to see this all as a single entity. It's our data. It's valuable. We need to protect it. Even at the same time they really want it simultaneously put to work in other systems, by partners, or even the public. Because they cannot separate the layers, and understand the need for separate licensing considerations, they end up being very closed with the data, schema, and API layers of their operations--introducing friciton at all steps of the application and data life cycle.</p>
<p>Modern approaches to <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com">API management</a> and logging at the API layer is how savvy data stewards are simultaenoulsy opening up access, and maintaing control over data, while also increasing awareness around how data is being put to use, or not used. Key-based access, <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com">rate limits, access plans</a>, are all approaches to opening up access to data, while maximizing control, and maintaining a desired balance of power between steward, partners, and consumers. In this model, your schema and API definition needs to be open, accessible, and shareable, where the data itself can be much more tightly controlled, depending on the goals of the data steward, and the needs of consumers.</p>
<p>Let me know if you want to talk through the separation of these layers of licensing and access around your data resources. I'm all for helping you protect your valuable data, but in a pragrmatic way. If you want to be successful in partnering with other stakeholders, you need to be thinking more critically about separating the layers of your data operations, and getting better at peeling back the onion of your data operations--something that seems to leave many folks with tears in their eyes.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/04/21/the-sla-is-becoming-standard-across-google-apis/">I talked about Google's shift towards providing an SLA across their cloud services last week</a>, and this week I'd like to highlight <a href="http://apimetrics.io/2017/04/21/casc-score/">APIMetric's&nbsp;Cloud API Service Consistency (CASC) score</a>, and how it can be applied to determine if an API is meeting their SLA or not. APIMetric&nbsp;came up with the CASC Score as part of their APImetrics Insights analytics package, and has shown been very open with the API ranking system, as well as the data behind.</p>
<p>The CASC score provides us with an API reliability and stability ranking for us to apply across our APIs, providing one very important layer of a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/10/31/how-are-we-going-to-create-the-standard-and-poors-and-moodys-for-the-api-economy/">comprehensive API rating system</a>&nbsp;that we can use across the industries being impacted by APIs. I said in my story about Google's SLAs that companies should have an API present for their APIs. They will also need to ensure that 3rd party API service providers like APIMetrics are gathering the data, and providing us with a CASC score for all the APIs we depend on in our businesses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know that external monitoring service providers like APIMetrics, and API ranking systems like the CASC score make some API providers nervous, but if you want to sell to the enterprise, government, and other critical infrastructure, you will need to over it. I also recommend that you work hard to reduce barriers for API service providers to get at the data they need, as well as get out there way when it comes to publish the data publicly, and sharing or aggregating it as part of industry level rating for groups of APIs.</p>
<p>If we want this API economy, that we keep talking about to scale, we are going to have to make sure we have SLAs, and ensuring we are meeting them throughout our operations. <a href="http://apimetrics.io/sla-monitoring/">SLA monitoring helps us meet our contractual engagements with our customers</a>, but they are also beginning to contribute to an overall ranking system being used across the industries we operate in. This is something that is only going to grow and expand, so the sooner we get the infrastructure in place to determine our service level benchmarks, monitor and aggregate the corresponding data, the better off we are going to be in a fast-growing API economy.</p>

<p><a href="http://google.stack.network/">I've been working my way through all of the Google APIs,</a> making sure I have an OpenAPI for each API, as well as an <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>&nbsp;for the entire API operations. One of the things I index as part of each APIs.json&nbsp;when it is present, is a service level agreement (SLA). Something I found to quickly becoming standard across Google APIs.</p>

<p>Like the rest of the startup space recently, Google has been making the shift towards selling to the enterprise. The days of having open access to APIs, with no business model involved, and no guarantees a certain level of service are gone. Before any large organization is going to bake an API into their operations, they are going to need an SLA present as part of the deal.</p>
<p>I'll keep an eye out for other API providers who make an SLA available, and see if I can keep track of this shift to doing business the enterprise in startup land. I have some more questions about SLA beyond just revenue exchanged for an API, and how an API contract, backed by an SLA holds up as part of the startup life cycle--more specifically, how it holds up as part of an acquisition.</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Apr 2017</span>
        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/drone_control_sunset.png" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p>As one of my clients is preparing to move their API from deployment to management, I'm helping them think through what is necessary to make sure their API is ready for use by a wider, more public group of developers. Ideally, I am brought into the discussion earlier on in the lifecycle, to influence design and deployment decisions, but I'm happy to be included at any time during the process. This is a generalized, and anonymized version of what I'm proposing to my client, to help make sure their API is ready for prime time--I just wanted to share with you a little of what goes on behind the scenes at API Evangelist, even when my clients aren't quite ready to talk publicly.</p>
<p><strong>External Developer Number One</strong><br />The first place I can help with the release of your API is when it comes to being the first external developer and fresh pair of eyes on your API. I can help with signing up, and actually making calls against every API, to make sure things are coherent and stable before putting in the hands of 3rd party developers at a hackathon, amongst partners, or the general public. This is a pre-requisite for me when it comes to writing a story on any API or doing additional consulting work, as it puts me in tune with what an API actual does, or doesn't do. The process will help provide you with a new perspective on the project after you have put so much work into the platform--in my case, it is a fresh pair of eyes that have on-boarded with 1000s of APIs.</p>
<p><strong>Crafting Your API Developer Portal</strong><br />Your operations will need a single place to go to engage with everything API. I always recommend deploying API portals using <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>, because it becomes the first are to engage with developers on Github, as part of your overall API efforts. Github is the easiest way to design, develop, deploy, and manage the API portal for your API efforts. I suggest focusing on all of the essential building blocks that any API operations should possess:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Landing Page</strong> 
<ul>
<li><strong>Tag Line </strong>- A short tagline describing what is possible using your API.</li>
<li><strong>Description</strong> - A quick description (single paragraph) about what is available.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>On-boarding</strong> 
<ul>
<li><strong>Signup Process </strong>- A link to the sign-up process for getting involved (OpenID).</li>
<li><strong>Getting Started </strong>- A simple description, and numbered list of what it takes to get started.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication Overview</strong> - A page dedicated to how authentication works.</li>
<li><strong>FAQ</strong> - A listing of frequently asked questions broken down into categories, for easy browsing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Integration</strong> 
<ul>
<li><strong>Documentation</strong> - Interactive documentation generated by the swagger / OpenAPI definition.</li>
<li><strong>Code</strong> - Conde sample, or software development kits for developers to put to work.</li>
<li><strong>Postman Collection</strong> - A Postman Collection + Button for loading up APIs into Postman client.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Support</strong> 
<ul>
<li><strong>Github</strong> - Set up Github account, establish profile, and setup portal as the first point of support.</li>
<li><strong>Twitter</strong> - Set up a Twitter account, establish a presence, and make know open for business.</li>
<li><strong>Email</strong> - Establish a single, shared email account that ca provide support for all developers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Communications</strong> 
<ul>
<li><strong>Blog</strong> - Establish a blog using Jekyll (easy with Github Pages), and begin telling stories of the platform.</li>
<li><strong>Twitter</strong> - Get the Twitter account in sync with communication, as well as support efforts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Updates</strong> 
<ul>
<li><strong>Roadmap</strong> - Using Github issues, establish a label, and rhythm for sharing out the platform roadmap.</li>
<li><strong>Issues</strong> - Using Github issues, establish a label, and rhythm for sharing out current issues with the platform.</li>
<li><strong>Change Log</strong> - Using Github issues, establish a label and rhythm for sharing out changes made to the platform.</li>
<li><strong>Status</strong> - Publish a monitoring and status page keeping users in tune with the platform stability and availability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Legal</strong> 
<ul>
<li><strong>Terms of Service </strong>- Establish the terms of service for your platform.</li>
<li><strong>Privacy Policy </strong>- Establish the privacy policy for your platform.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these building blocks have been aggregated from across thousands of APIs, and are something <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ALL successful API providers possess</span>. I recommend starting here. You will need this as a baseline to get up and running with developers, whether generally on the web or through specific hackathons and your private engagements. Being developer number one, and helping craft, deploy, and polish the resources available via a coherent developer portal are what I bring to the table, and willing to set aside time to help you make happen.</p>
<p>Additionally, I'm happy to set into motion some other discussions regarding pushing forward your API operations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discovery</strong> - Establish a base discovery plan for the portal, including SEO, APIs.json development</li>
<li><strong>Validation</strong> - Validate each API endpoint, and establish JSON assertions as part of the OpenAPI & testing.</li>
<li><strong>Testing</strong> - Establish a testing strategy for not just monitoring all API endpoints, but make sure they return valid data.</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong> - Think about security beyond just identity and API keys, and begin scanning API endpoints, and looking for vulnerabilities.</li>
<li><strong>Embeddable</strong> - Pull together a strategy for embeddable tooling including buttons, badges, and widgets.</li>
<li><strong>Webhooks</strong> - Consider how to develop a webhook strategy allowing information to be pushed out to developers, reducing calls to APIs.</li>
<li><strong>iPaaS</strong> - Think through how to develop an iPaaS strategy to allow for integration with platforms like <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a>, empowering developers and non-developers alike.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is how I am helping companies make sure their APIs are ready for prime time. I regularly encounter many teams who have great APIs but have been too close to the ovens baking the bread, and find it difficult to go from development to management in a coherent way. I have on-boarded and hacked on thousands of APIs. I have been doing this for over a decade, and exclusively as a full-time job for the last seven years. I am your ideal first developer and can save you significant amounts of time when it comes to crafting and deploying your API portal.</p>
<p>As a one person operation, I don't have the time to do this for every company that approaches me, but I'm happy to engage with almost everyone who reaches out, to understand how I can best help. Who knows, I might help prevent you from making some pretty common mistakes, and I am happy to be a safer, early beta user of your APIs--one tha will give you the feedback you are looking for.</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Apr 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/11401079_10153382852574813_2225414678045568111_n.jpg" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I am working with an enterprise group to develop a curriculum that will be used across internal training workshops executed around the globe. They are looking to push their entire company towards an API way of doing things, and empower business and IT groups to realize their API potential. I'm anonymizing the company, as they have not agreed to me talking about publicly, but as I do, I wanted to share my work behind the scenes, and help other organizations&nbsp;be aware of the work that I do.</p>
<p>The API training curriculum is going to be designed to reach and bring up to speed three levels of internal users:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>API Beginners -</strong>&nbsp;The introduction to the world of APIs for business or technical groups.</li>
<li><strong>API Partners -</strong>&nbsp;An outward focus for how APIs bring value to the organization and operations.</li>
<li><strong>API Trainers -</strong>&nbsp;Training the next generation of trainers, evangelists, and storytellers within the organization.</li>
</ol>
<p>The beginner level will be designed for all employees to attend, no matter which group they come from. The second level of training will focus on equipping the more outward focused employees, with the third tier focusing on the long-term institutionalization of an API-first approach across the company. Customized tiers can be developed in the future, but these three levels will get things moving across all areas of global operations.</p>
<p>Here is a summary of how the training will be developed and executed:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Design Curriculum&nbsp;</strong>- Design, develop, and prepare the curriculum, and the materials for all three workshop levels.</li>
<li><strong>Run Pilot Sessions</strong>&nbsp;- Conduct 2-3 pilot sessions with a controlled group of users, with possible changes, and additions to the content.</li>
<li><strong>Execute Workshops&nbsp;</strong>- Execute workshops in up to five countries initially, targeting only English speaking regions in the first round.</li>
<li><strong>Train the Trainer -</strong>&nbsp;Organize a train-the-trainer session for future API Evangelists, and workshop trainers, preparing for future rollout.</li>
</ol>
<p>I develop and evolve my curriculum and training materials as I would an API, using Github. All content is developed as an interactive repository in HTML, CSS, and JS, with exportable PDFs, and&nbsp;presentations are done using&nbsp;<a href="http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/">Deck.js</a>. The goal is to create content that can be versioned, forked, and localized for workshops,&nbsp;training, and across operations.</p>
<p>I am willing to offer a 10% discount if your organization is willing to allow the story of this process to be told publicly. A blog series about the process, from design to implementation. I'm happy to keep specific operational, and IP related material out of stories, but I would like to tell the story from the perspective of the trainer and evangelist -- adding another storyteller layer to the program.</p>
<p>If you need help with API transformation across your company, organization, institution, or government agency, and would like to develop training and workshop curriculum, feel free to reach out. API for beginners is always a great place to start, but I'm happy to help craft other internally distributed curriculum like API design guides, API operational strategies, all the way to API evangelism material. Let me know how I can help--developing materials for established organizations to assist them in making the shift towards doing business with APIs is something I'm investing significant cycles into in 2017 and 2018.</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Apr 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-conversational-interfaces.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/04/20/continous-integration-platform-as-a-service-at-the-command-line/">I recently wrote about how Zapier's new command line interface has a continuous integration feel to it</a>, and while I was writing the piece, I kept thinking about how these integration apps could be used as part of conversational interfaces. I'm thinking about messaging, voice, or even <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/02/08/api-embeddables-in-a-conversational-interface-world/">embeddable conversational interfaces</a>, and <a href="https://zapier.com/engineering/zapier-command-line-interface/">Zapier's CLI</a> could be used to define some known conversational scenarios we encounter on a regular basis.</p>
<p>I'm thinking about the side of conversational interfaces that is more known and scripted. I'm not thinking about creating applications that could hold their own in a natural language conversation, but ones could be defined as part of known business processes, matching a well-defined question and set of rules. "put new RSS feed post into Google Sheet", or "take new Instagram photos, and Tweet it out". A well-scripted set of business actions that I conduct on a regular basis. Applications defined and managed via Zapier CLI, that are continuously integrated, into the conversational interfaces I use regularly use - Slack, Twitter, Facebook, my browser, and SMS on my iPhone.</p>
<p>I want an application&nbsp;for each of the micro conversation I have with online services each day. If a new conversation hasn't been defined, I want an easy way to articulate myself in terms of <a href="https://zapier.com/engineering/">the 750+ applications that Zapier integrates with</a>, and a way to have these Node.js applications introduced into the continuous integration for my conversational interfaces. I want all my conversational interfaces to be automated, with hundreds or thousands of little conversations going on in the background of my operations each day. The command line seems like an appropriate layer to make these conversational requests a reality--especially since Zapier is already having the conversations with the service I'm depending each day.</p>

        <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/keep_door_open_stories.jpg" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p>The world is built on stories. People enjoy telling and hearing stories. Stories are the lifeblood of what I do as the API Evangelist and are the number one way I stay in touch with people across many different industries and around the globe. As a single person shop there is only so many calls I can conduct in any single day, and there are only so many folks I can ping on a regular basis to stay in touch--I rely on the power of stories to do the hard work for me, acting as the distributed glue in my world.</p>
<p>When I connect with someone new via Twitter, email, or in person, I always close up the conversation with, "if you ever have any good stories for me to tell, either anonymously, or directly, make sure and reach out". I do need the stories, but my primary objective in doing this is to keep the communication channels open and encourage folks to do the heavy lifting when it comes to remembering to reaching out to me and renew the connection between us. The urge to share (and be heard) or hear a good story is always much stronger than the desire to buy or sell a product (aka sales lead), making this approach produce the return on investment (ROI) I am looking for.</p>
<p>I see my approach in contrast to the urge to tip of major tech blogs about a product release or investment because it often isn't about the tech--it almost always is about the humans. Companies want to talk to Techcrunch when a product, feature, investment, or press releases, and people contact me when something good or bad has happened involving the humans. Sure, I still get the regular release engagement, but it is the stories that truly matter to me, and to my readers. Storytelling is the way I reach a large audience on a regular basis, and the way that a global group of people stay engagement with me, even when the migrate companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies--stories are everything, and always the best way to keep the door open.</p>

        <span class="post-date">20 Apr 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/open_referral_aws_google_azure_heroku.png" alt="" width="30%" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="https://openreferral.github.io/api-specification/definition/">I have several&nbsp;volunteers available to do work on Open Referral's Human Services Data Specification (API)</a>. I have three developers who are ready to work on some projects, as well as an ongoing stream of potential developers I would like to keep busy working on a variety of implementations. I am focusing attention on the top four cloud platforms that companies are using today: AWS, Azure, Google, and Heroku.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am looking to develop a rolling wave of projects that will run on any cloud platform, as well as taking advantage of the unique features that each provider offers. I've setup Github projects for managing the brainstorming and development of solutions for each of the four cloud platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://open.referral.aws.adopta.agency/">AWS</a></strong> - A project site outlining the services, tooling, projects, and communication around HSDS AWS development.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://open.referral.azure.adopta.agency/">Azure</a></strong> -&nbsp;A project site outlining the services, tooling, projects, and communication around HSDS Azure development.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://open.referral.google.adopta.agency/">Google</a></strong> -&nbsp;A project site outlining the services, tooling, projects, and communication around HSDS Google development.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://open.referral.heroku.adopta.agency/">Heroku</a></strong> -&nbsp;A project site outlining the services, tooling, projects, and communication around HSDS Heroku development.</li>
</ul>
<p>I want to incentivize the develop of APIs, that follow v1.1 of the HSDS OpenAPI. I'm encouraging PHP, Python, Ruby, and Node.js implementations, but open to other suggestions. I would like to have very simple API implementations in each language, running on all four of the cloud platforms, with push button (or at least easy) installation from Github for each implementation.</p>
<p>Ideally, we focus on single API implementations, until there is a complete toolbox that helps providers of all shapes and sizes. Then I'd love to see administrative, web search, and other applications that can be implemented on top of any HSDS API. I can imagine the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API</strong> - Server-side implementations, or API implementation using specialized services available via any of the providers like Lambda, or Google Endpoints.</li>
<li><strong>Validator</strong> - A JSON Schema, andany other suggested validotr for the API definition, helping implementations validate their APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Admin</strong> - Develop an administrative system for managing all of the data, content, and media that is stored as part of an HSDS API implementation.</li>
<li><strong>Website</strong> - Develop a website or application that allows data, content, and media within an HSDS API implementation to be searched, browsed and engaged with by end-users.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile App</strong> -&nbsp;Develop a mobile application that allows data, content, and media within an HSDS API implementation to be searched, browsed and engaged with by end-users via common mobile devices.</li>
<li><strong>Developer Porta</strong>l - Develop an API portal for managing and providing access to an HSDS API Implementation, allowing developers to sign up, and integrate with an API in their web, mobile, or another type of application.</li>
<li><strong>Push Button Deployment </strong>- The ability to deploy any of the server side API implementations to the desired cloud platform of your choice with minimum configuration.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm looking to incentivize a buffet of simple API-driven implementations that can be easily deployment by cities, states, and other organizations that help deliver human services. They shouldn't be too complicated or be trying to do everything for everyone. Ideally, they are simple, easily deployed infrastructure that can provide a seed for organizations looking to get started with their API efforts.</p>
<p>Additionally, I am looking understand the realities of running a single API design across multiple cloud platforms. It seems like a realistic vision, but I know it is one that will be much more difficult than my geek brain thinks it will be. Along the way, I'm hoping to learn a lot more about each cloud platform, as well as the nuance of keeping my API design simple, even if the underlying platform varies from provider to provider.</p>

        <span class="post-date">20 Apr 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2017_04_17_at_12.55.54_pm.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>Integration platform as a service (iPaaS) provider Zapier <a href="https://zapier.com/engineering/zapier-command-line-interface/">recently launched a command line tool for managing your integrations</a>, adding an interesting dimension to the platform--leaning in what feels like a continuous integration direction. The integration platform has long had a web builder for managing your integrations with over 750 API-driven services, using their APIs, but the command line interface feels like it's begging to be embedded into your development workflow and life cycle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zapier is catering to engineers by allowing them to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bring your Node libraries.</strong> Zapier CLI Apps are made entirely of Node JS code. Use whichever libraries from NPM that you like. You can control every aspect of how Zapier interacts with your API, and our schema defines how authentication, Triggers, Actions, and Searches work.</li>
<li><strong>Run your tests before you deploy</strong>. We believe unit testing is the best way to ensure high-quality code. You can use Mocha or another Node testing framework to feel confident in the code you deploy to Zapier.</li>
<li><strong>Your app can live in source control.</strong> Every aspect of your integration&mdash;and every change you make&mdash;is written in code. That means you can track changes with Git or other source control like you do on other projects.</li>
<li><strong>Version your app.</strong> You work in releases or sprints for the rest of your projects, why not do the same with your Zapier app? Turn your app updates into versions, then migrate some or all of your users to the latest version.</li>
<li><strong>Collaborate with teammates.</strong> You don&rsquo;t need to go it alone with your Zapier integration. A CLI app can be owned by more than one Zapier account, with new members quickly added using the tool. That way, the whole team can deploy updates to your Zapier app.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the benefits of the Zapier CLI over the current web builder:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Coding locally.</strong> As mentioned above, you build CLI Apps on your local machine&mdash;not on Zapier's website.</li>
<li><strong>Improved control over authentication flow. </strong>CLI Apps give you control over the API calls needed to set up authentication. This is particularly helpful if your API uses a slightly different flow for OAuth2 than what the Web Builder assumes. Now, you can determine the necessary calls and store whatever info your API needs.</li>
<li><strong>Improved Custom Fields. </strong>When setting input fields, you can define static fields as well as functions to compute fields dynamically. These dynamic fields can be the result of API calls, or they can be computed based on the value of a static field.</li>
<li><strong>Middleware.</strong> Tired of including a function call to add a header to each request? Or a call to parse out the responses? Now you can define middleware that runs before requests or after responses to process calls in a standard way.</li>
<li><strong>Resources.</strong> You can define a single resource like a &ldquo;Contact&rdquo; and the methods allowed on that resource&mdash;like &ldquo;get, list, create.&rdquo; From this resource definition, Zapier can automatically generate Triggers and Actions, reusing some of the meta information defined on the resource.</li>
</ul>
<p>First, I see this significantly benefiting companies and organizations when it comes to the orchestration of internal and partner APIs--your engineering team should be developing Zapier applications for your most important business functions. Second,&nbsp;I see this significantly benefiting companies and organizations when it comes to empowering&nbsp;internal business and technical folks with a complete library of workflows for all the 3rd party services you depend on, like SalesForce, Google, Facebook, Twitter, and other leading SaaS providers.</p>
<p>Providing a Command Line Interface (CLI) alongside an Application Programming Interface (API) seems to be coming back into popularity, partly due to continuous integration (CI) trends. Amazon has always had a CLI alongside their APIs, but it is something other API providers, as well as API service providers like Zapier, seem to be tapping into. I'm going to make some time to build a stack of API Evangelist Zapier apps so I can define some of my most common integrations, and explore further automation as part of my own internal continuous integration workflow.</p>

        <span class="post-date">19 Apr 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/old_door_lock_2_umberto_bocc.jpg" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>In my travels over the last couple of weeks I have found myself in two separate cities, listening to two separate stories about using APIs to help protect some valuable data, that someone was trying to defend, but also putting out there with APIs in hopes of generating revenue to keep things ing. Often times when you mention APIs to someone, they automatically think they will have less control over their data in a digital environment, but increasingly company's are realizing that they actually have the potential to result in more control.</p>
<p><strong>In Oxford, UK</strong><br />While in Oxford I met with the <a href="https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com/">dictionaries&nbsp;API team</a>, as well as other groups in charge of the important resource, including the OED team. They have been working on their dictionary content since 1884. They have put a significant amount of work into their dictionaries, and are very keen on defending the value of this important resource, while also making it available for use by partners, as well as the public. They are looking for APIs to help them define their dictionary API resources, and evolve them based on the feedback of their trusted partners who are approved to use the APIs.</p>
<p><strong>In Boulder, CO</strong><br />While in Boulder I met with a 211 data service provider, and a handful of their 211 operators who are looking for APIs to help them protect their valuable resources. Each city, county, or state organization has invested a lot into their databases of organizations, locations, and services that deliver vital human services in their local area. It takes a good deal of investment to maintain an up to date 211 system, and these operators are looking to fund that hard work using APIs, while also defending the integrity of their valuable resource--striking just the right balance with APIs.</p>
<p>APIs are not a guarantee that your data will always be in a perfect state, and only in the hands of the right people, but a well-managed API implementation can go long ways to protect a valuable dataset, while also making it easily accessible to those who should have access. APIs are helping Oxford Dictionaries, and 211 operators define access to their APIs on their terms--all while logging, metering, and stay in tune with who is accessing, and how they are using it.</p>
<p>Both Oxford Dictionaries and city, county, and state 211 operators want their data as widely available as possible. They want their partners to have easy access, but they also want to maintain a certain amount of control over the quality of the data, and how it is used, and made available on the open web. APIs are helping them define this access, while also being able to understand how APIs are consumed by applying rate limiting when it makes sense, and generating much-needed revenue to invest back into future development.</p>
<p>My recent travels have given me two new stories I can tell when helping companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies are looking understand how you can use APIs to protect your data.</p>

<p><a href="http://partners.apievangelist.com/">I've been tracking on how API providers operate their partner programs for a while now,</a> in hopes of pulling together some sort of blueprint that other API providers can follow. I'm always happy to find stop along the API life cycle where an API provider has already developed a robust operational API, like the <a href="https://developers.google.com/partners/">Google Partner API</a>.</p>
<p>The Google Partner API provides the essential building blocks of a pretty sophisticated partner program API including company, messaging, company, lead, offer, status, profile, user, relations, and analytics. It is a nicely designed APIs, providing a complete set of paths, with lots of detail and robustness when it comes to the surface area of the API, the data it returns.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/partners/reference/rest/">When you look at the documentation for the Google Partner API</a>, it provides a good example of where Google is taking their API design across the company, by providing a REST, as well as a gRPC version of the resource. All future APIs at the search giant will be following this approach, providing simpler REST APIs, then higher performance editions if you want with gRPC.</p>
<p>Next time I update <a href="http://partners.apievangelist.com/">my partner API research</a>, this story will be present. I will look for other partner API examples, and then take the design patterns present in the Google Partner API, and <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/api-stack/google/master/_data/api-commons/google-partners/google-partners-api-openapi-spec.yaml">publish the OpenAPI for the project</a>, as a suggestion for how you could design your partner API. Maybe I can even convince someone to craft some server-side implementations of the API, on a variety of platforms.</p>

<p>I have been ranting about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/01/25/moving-towards-a-meaningful-set-of-icons-for-the-api-community/">an icon set for the API community</a> for over a year now. I want there to be more than just <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/21/a-new-api-programming-language-sdk-icon-set/">a set of SDK programming language icons</a>. Something that would <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/03/22/api-icon-vocabulary/">give us a visual API vocabulary,</a> and allow us to plan, share, and implement API infrastructure <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/10/21/icons-to-describe-each-of-your-api-resources-like-aws/">like AWS is beginning to do with their own icon </a><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/10/21/icons-to-describe-each-of-your-api-resources-like-aws/">set</a>, and their <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/04/12/open-source-drag-and-drop-api-lifecycle-design-tooling/">latest visual tooling for defining your architecture</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://google.stack.network/">While profiling Google APIs</a>, I'm seeing a pretty disorganized approach to logos beyond just core services, the absence of any dedicated icons that represent specific Google APIs. Amazon is pretty far ahead of the game when it comes visual iconography to represent the services they offer, and will dominate when it comes to visual life cycle tooling, unless Google, Microsoft, or some other provder&nbsp;begin to invest in meaningful icons.</p>
<p>Ideally, someone will do this in a more open source way, giving us the Schema.org for icons that represent cloud computing, machine learning, and the many other API driven resources being put to work today. Even if it is an open source solution, each service provider will have to be involved in some way, and invested in the process to some degree. I picture a world where API service providers like Zapier don't have to develop their own iconography, and there is a wealth of well thought out, and simply design icons for everyone to pick from.</p>

<p>I am seeing a significant number of infrastructure orchestration solutions in the cloud start using YAML templates as the core setting of settings and instructions for workflows. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2016/09/aws-cloudformation-introduces-yaml-template-support-and-cross-stack-references/">Amazon recently introduced YAML templates for your AWS CloudFormations</a>, where you can define the infrastructure templates you are using throughout the API life cycle. These AWS YAML templates are fast becoming the central definition to be used across AWS operations, with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/02/aws-service-catalog-introduces-support-for-yaml-formatted-aws-cloudformation-templates/">support in the AWS Service Catalog</a>.</p>
<p>Whether you use AWS or not, working to define your infrastructure using YAML templates help define what is going on. I'm seeing significant adoption of <a href="https://www.openapis.org/">OpenAPIs</a> in YAML, and I'm even beginning to create API operational indexes using <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>&nbsp;converted into YAML (there is a naming lesson in there). I also have YAML templates for <a href="http://apievangelist.com">each area of my API lifecycle research</a>, providing me machine readable definitions for everything from news to patents, that I then use across my API research&nbsp;and storytelling.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/20/i-am-feeling-the-same-about-yaml-as-i-did-with-json-a-decade-ago/">I feel the same way about YAML as I did about JSON a decade ago</a>, and it is quickly becoming my preferred format for any structured data, no matter where it is used in my operations. YAML + Github is quickly becoming the engine for some interesting ways of delivering infrastructure, and specifically API infrastructure, in a consistent way that is easy to communicate with others. This example focuses on AWS usage of YAML, but it is something I'm seeing from Google&nbsp;and other tech giants. I think the readability of YAML (minus quotes and brackets) makes it accessible to a wider audience beyond developer groups, something that is going to be critical to doing APIs at scale.</p>

<p>I'm always amazed at the number of companies I work with that do not consider log files a first class data system. Log files for servers, web servers, and other systems or applications are only for when something goes wrong. I have to admit, I'm in the same situation. I have APIs on the logging for my API management layer, but I do not have easy API access to my Linux servers or the Apache web server that runs on top of them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know that some companies use popular solutions like New Relic to do this, and <a href="http://logging.apievangelist.com/organizations/">I keep track on about eight API friendly logging solutions</a>. I'm going to have to spend some time in my <a href="http://logging.apievangelist.com">API logging research</a> digging around for a solution I can use to stand up an API for my server(s). I'm not looking for any tooling on top of it, just something dead simple to parse my log files, put into a database, and allow me to wrap in a simple API for developing things on top of it.</p>
<p>The first thing I'll build is some analytics. Maybe there is some ready-to-go solution already out there, that are API-drive and familiar with server, or web server logs? It bothers me that logs aren't a first class data system in my operations. Maybe the awareness of crafting and developing against a logging API would help me get more in tune with this layer of data exhaust being generated from my operations daily. I'm guessing it will also help me get a handle on performance and security across my systems, helping take the health my operations up a notch or two.</p>

<p>Each API has the essential building blocks like getting started, documentation, pricing, and other resources. I don't see any machine readable index like APIs.json or OpenAPI but will keep an eye out. If I have the time I will generate an index for the project after I'm done with some of the other leading cloud and machine learning platforms like <a href="http://amazon.web.services.stack.network/">AWS</a> and <a href="http://google.stack.network/">Google</a>.</p>

<p>I'm in the middle of evolving a data schema to be a living breathing API. I just finished generating 130 paths, all with the same names as the schema tables and their fields. It's a natural beginning to any data-centric API. In these situations, it is easy for us to allow the backend system to dictate our approach to API design, rather than considering how the API will actually be used.</p>
<p><a href="https://openreferral.github.io/api-specification/definition/">I'm taking the Human Service Data Specification (HSDS) schema, and generating the 130 create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) API paths I need for the API</a>. This allows the organizations, location, services, and other details being managed as part of any human service API that will be managed in a very database-driven way. This makes sense to my database administrator brain, but as I sit in a room full of implementors I'm reminded that none of this matters&nbsp;if it isn't serving an actual business objective.</p>
<p>If my API endpoints don't allow a help desk technician properly search for a service, or a website user browse the possibilities to find what they are looking for, my API means nothing. The CRUD is the easy part. Understanding the many different ways my API paths will (or won't) help someone find the services they need&nbsp;or assist a human service organization to better reach their audience is what the API(s) are all about, not just simply reflecting the backend system, and then walking away calling the job done.</p>

<p>Everyone once in a while I get a comment from someone regarding competition in the API storytelling space, alluding to someone getting the page views, or audience when it comes to APIs. I rarely worry about these things, and in reality, I want to see way more competition and outlets when it comes to short and long form API storytelling--the API space needs as many voices as it possibly can.</p>
<p>I'd like to see domain specific evangelists emerge, beyond individual API advocates. Someone covering industrial, machine learning, healthcare, and other significant verticals. We need to begin to cultivate domain expertise, and preferably&nbsp;vendor-agnostic, and tooling-comprehensive knowledge and accompanying storytelling. Some of these verticals are in desperate need of leadership, and I just don't have the time to focus in on any single area for too long.</p>
<p><a href="http://nordicapis.com/">We need more practical, and hands-on API storytelling like we are seeing from the Nordic APIs</a>. They are rocking the storytelling lately, exceeding the quality I can achieve on API Evangelist. They are hitting all the important areas of the&nbsp;API life cycle, and their storytelling is genuine, useful, and not pushing any single product or service. The Nordic APIs is invested in educating the community, something that makes their work stand out--emulate what they are up to if you need a model to follow, don't follow mine. #seriously</p>
<p>If you are an API provider or possibly aggregator and marketplace, consider following the lead of <a href="https://bbvaopen4u.com/en/actualidad">BBVAOpen4U API Market</a>, they produce some interesting content, as well as also have a good way of sharing and syndicating quality content from across the API space.&nbsp;I've seen a lot of companies come and go when it comes to aggregation and syndication of API stories. I like BBVA's open approach, because they have skin in the game, and seem to genuinely want to highlight other interesting things going on in the space--something more API providers should be doing.</p>
<p>If you want to get started in the space, all you need is a blog, a Github, and Twitter account. Come up with a name, and begin learning and writing. Don't worry about page views, or having a voice when you first start, just write. Then as you feel comfortable, and find your voice, begin sharing your work more, as well as highlight the work of other storytellers in the space you are learning from. If you keep at it for a while, you never know, you might actually build a following, and be able to influence the world of APIs through the stories you tell--give it a shot.</p>

<p>I am working to push forward <a href="http://embeddable.apievangelist.com/">my embeddable API research</a> today, so I'm on the hunt for new tools and standards that can be included in my research and put to work by API providers. One of the top reasons for doing embeddable tools is the sharing of information and media on the web. Share buttons have become ubiquitous, so I wanted to have some standard approaches to making them a default part of API operations.</p>
<p>While monitoring the API space I came across "<a href="https://github.com/WICG/web-share">a proposal to add an API to the web for sharing text, URLs and images to an arbitrary destination of the user's choice</a>":</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><a href="https://github.com/WICG/web-share">Web Share</a>&nbsp;is a proposed web API to enable a site to share data (text, URLs, images, etc) to an arbitrary destination of the user's choice. It could be a system service, a native app or another website. The goal is to enable web developers to build a generic "share" button that the user can click to trigger a system share dialog.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em>The current options for sharing content from a web page are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Share buttons to specific web services (e.g., Facebook and Twitter buttons).</li>
<li>Share buttons built into the browser UI. Many browsers, especially on mobile, have a "share" button that sends the current page URL to a native app of the user's choice.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://github.com/WICG/web-share">Web Share</a> provides a pretty simple, yet useful example for sharing links. I'm adding it to <a href="http://embeddable.apievangelist.com/tools/">tmy toolbox for my embeddable research</a>. Once I gather a variety of other tools and standards I will step back to look at the 100K view. I'm hoping to stimulate a more embeddable approach to conversational interfaces, something that us asynchronous antisocial folk can work with, going beyond just voice, and messaging.&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Apr 2017</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/apistrat_linux_portland.png" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></p>
<p>In the summer of 2012, Steve Willmott approached me with the idea of doing an API conference. We had both been discussing the need for a vendor-neutral&nbsp;API conference throughout the year, and now he wanted to make it a reality. We got to work talking to potential sponsors to see if the idea would be financially viable, and after a handful of conversation, we quickly had the sponsor support we needed to go ahead with the real thing.</p>
<p><a href="http://newyork2013.apistrat.com/">The first API Strategy &amp; Practice (APIStrat) was scheduled for December 2012 in New York City</a>, but had to be rescheduled to February of 2013 due to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Sandy">Hurrican Sandy</a>. Honestly, it ended up working out well, with the first APIStrat ended up being sold out. After we did New York, we followed up with San Francisco, Amsterdam, Chicago, Berlin, Austin, and the latest edition in Boston last November, and after seven events, <a href="https://www.linux.com/blog/event/API-strategy/2017/4/apistrat-conference-now-organized-linux-foundation-and-open-api-initiative">the conference will now be operated by the Linux&nbsp;foundation</a>, as part of the <a href="http://openapis.org">OpenAPI Initiative</a>.</p>
<p>I'm very happy to see the conference mature to this level. The conference has been a forum for sharing API knowledge for over three years, so it makes sense to elevate it as part of the movement at the OAI, something that is bigger than just the OpenAPI specification. The conference will have more reach, and resources available to it. APIStrat will have a much bigger events team, allowing it to continue to grow and evolve, beyond what Steve, myself, and the 3Scale team were able to make happen. It was a no-brainer to give the conference to the Linux Foundation, and the OAI--I couldn't imagine any better home for the conference I helped create.</p>
<p>I wanted to take a moment and thank Steve, and the 3Scale team for making APIStrat a reality. Without their support, it never would have been a thing. I was fortunate enough to ride the train, and help stimulate the conversation. I feel like the API space has matured and evolved alongside APIStrat, and while the conference is just a small part of the growing conversation, I feel like it definitely heleds drive awareness and healthy growth across the API sector. 3Scale was central to all of this happening, behaving in a humble, vendor-neutral way the entire time, while also ensuring&nbsp;the event was fully funded each round, even when it meant running at a loss--thank you 3Scale (and Red Hat).</p>
<p><a href="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat/">The 8th edition of APIStrat is scheduled for October / November in Portland, Oregon</a>. The entire Linux Foundation community is currently being mobilized, and we are beginning to talk about on the ground engagement with the Portland developer and business community, <a href="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apistrat/">so make sure to get involved where you can</a>. Steve and I are still very involved in the event, we just have a much bigger team to help pull it off now. I'm very happy to see how things have evolved, and I am looking forward to our baby growing up and becoming much bigger than our original vision. Thanks to <a href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a>, <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en">Red Hat</a>, the <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/">Linux Foundation</a>, and the OAI team for pulling this off, I'm looking forward to the ongoing conversations about APIs with the growing APIStrat community.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Apr 2017</span>

<p>I am working through the <a href="http://amazon.web.services.stack.network/">AWS APIs</a>&nbsp;and the <a href="http://google.stack.network/">Google APIs</a>, and profiling the building blocks across both of these API operations. My objective in doing this work is to learn as much as I possibly&nbsp;can about how these companies are doing APIs. After diving into Google's APIs I noticed that they were slightly more ahead of the curve when it comes to providing server level agreements (SLA) for their cloud APIs, than AWS.</p>
<p>I noticed nine while working through Google APIs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>BigQuery</strong> - <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/sla">https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/sla</a></li>
<li><strong>StackDriver</strong> - <a href="https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/sla">https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/sla</a></li>
<li><strong>Key Management Service</strong> - <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kms/sla">https://cloud.google.com/kms/sla</a></li>
<li><strong>Datastore</strong> - <a href="https://cloud.google.com/datastore/sla">https://cloud.google.com/datastore/sla</a></li>
<li><strong>Pub/Sub </strong>- <a href="https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/sla">https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/sla</a></li>
<li><strong>Maps</strong> - <a href="https://enterprise.google.com/maps/terms/maps-sla.html">https://enterprise.google.com/maps/terms/maps-sla.html</a></li>
<li><strong>Prediction</strong> - <a href="https://cloud.google.com/prediction/sla">https://cloud.google.com/prediction/sla</a></li>
<li><strong>Compute -</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/sla">https://cloud.google.com/compute/sla</a></li>
<li><strong>App Engine </strong>- <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/sla">https://cloud.google.com/appengine/sla</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I noticed five SLAs while working through AWS APIs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>EC2</strong> - <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/sla/">https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/sla/</a></li>
<li><strong>Route 53</strong> - <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/route53/sla/">https://aws.amazon.com/route53/sla/</a></li>
<li><strong>S3</strong> - <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/sla/">https://aws.amazon.com/s3/sla/</a></li>
<li><strong>CloudFront</strong> - <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/sla/">https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/sla/</a></li>
<li><strong>RDS</strong> - <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/sla/">https://aws.amazon.com/rds/sla/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I am sure there are other dedicated SLA pages I'm missing, as well as SLAs embedded in the documentation and terms of service of systems. From what I can tell, these dedicated SLAs for APIs are in response to a shift in the landscape to sell more services to the enterprise, requiring that these details of doing business move front and center. With the volatility often associate with APIs in recent years, I'm guessing an API SLAs will continue to become an essential element in all API integration decisions in coming years.</p>
<p>There has been enough movement in the area of API service level agreements for me to consider adding a dedicated research area to my work. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/10/03/a-service-level-agreement-api-for-api-service-providers/">I've written about the SLA APIs I've stumbled&nbsp;</a><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/10/03/a-service-level-agreement-api-for-api-service-providers/">across</a>, and seeing SLAs float to the top with the bigcos, so it makes sense to pay closer attention to what is happening. Eventually, I'll aggregate the common building blocks across the API SLAs I'm finding, and the other more unique approaches to ensuring API reliability and stability&nbsp;when doing business online today.</p>

<p>I am working to take an existing API, built on top of an evolving data schema, and move forward a common API definition that 211 providers in cities across the country can put to use in their operations. The goal with the <a href="https://openreferral.github.io/api-specification/definition/">Human Services Data Specification (HSDS) API specification</a> is to encourage interoperability between 211 providers, allowing organizations to better deliver healthcare and other human services at the local and regional level.</p>
<p>So far, <a href="https://openreferral.github.io/api-specification/definition/v10/">I have crafted a v1.0 OpenAPI derived from an existing Code for America project called Ohana</a>, as well as <a href="https://openreferral.github.io/api-specification/definition/">a very CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) version 1.1 OpenAPI</a>, with <a href="http://developer.open.referral.adopta.agency/">a working API prototype for use as a reference</a>. I'm at a very important point in the design process with the HSDS API, and the design choices I make will stay with the project for a long, long time. I wanted to take pause and open up a conversation with the community about what is next with the APIs design.</p>
<p>I am opening &nbsp;up the conversation around some of the usual API design suspects like how we name paths, use headers, and status codes, but I feel like I should be also asking the big questions around use of hypermedia API design patterns, or possibly even GraphQL--a significant portion of the HSDS APIs driving city human services will be data intensive, and maybe GraphQL is one possible path forward. I'm not looking to do hypermedia and GraphQL because they are cool, I want them to serve specific business and organizational objectives.</p>
<p>To stimulate this conversation I've created some Github issues to talk about the usual suspects like <a href="https://github.com/adopta-agency/open-referral-spec/issues/8">versioning</a>, <a href="https://github.com/adopta-agency/open-referral-spec/issues/11">filtering</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/adopta-agency/open-referral-spec/issues/10">pagination</a>, <a href="https://github.com/adopta-agency/open-referral-spec/issues/12">sorting</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/adopta-agency/open-referral-spec/issues/3">status &amp; error codes</a>, but also opening up threads specifically for <a href="https://github.com/adopta-agency/open-referral-spec/issues/7">hypermedia</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/adopta-agency/open-referral-spec/issues/9">GraphQL</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/adopta-agency/open-referral-spec/issues/13">a thread as a catch-all for other API design considerations</a>. I'm looking to stimulate a conversation around the design of the HSDS API, but also develop some API design content that can help bring some folks up to speed on the decision-making process behind the crafting of an API at this scale.</p>
<p>HSDS isn't just the design for a single API, it is the design for potentially thousands of APIs, so I want to get this as right as I possibly can. Or at least make sure there has been sufficient discussion for this iteration of the API definition. I'll keep blogging about the process as we evolve, and settle in on decisions around each of these API design considerations. I'm hoping to make this a learning experience for myself, as well as all the stakeholders in the HSDS project, but also provide a blueprint for other API providers to consider as they are embarking on their API journey, or maybe just the next major version of its release.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/03/16/what-will-it-take-to-evolve-openapi-tooling-to-version-30/">I wrote a post asking what it would take to migrate OpenAPI tooling from version 2.0 to 3.0 of the API specification</a>, and Mike Ralphson (<a href="https://twitter.com/PermittedSoc">@PermittedSoc</a>) commented about some of the projects he's been working on involving the latest specification version. Which I hope is a good sign of things to come, when it comes to moving from version 2.0 to 3.0 in 2017.</p>
<p>Mike has developed <a href="https://github.com/mermade/swagger2openapi">an OpenAPI converter and validator to help people migrate their OpenAPI definitions from 2.0 to 3.0</a>. The open source tool also has <a href="https://openapi-converter.herokuapp.com/">an online version of the OpenAPI converter and validator for using in the browser</a>, and of course, it also has <a href="http://petstore.swagger.io/?url=https://openapi-converter.herokuapp.com/contract/swagger.json">an OpenAPI conversion and validation API</a>, because ALL API tools and services should have an API--it is just good API craft.</p>
<p>It makes sense that some of the first tools to emerge are for conversion. Many API developers will need to convert their existing API definitions into version 3.0 of the specification to begin <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/01/25/the-openapi-specification-version-30-highlights/">learning about what is new with OpenAPI 3.0</a>. If you have examples of OpenAPI 3.0 definitions for your API, please publish them to Github and share with me, so I can help point folks to examples in the wild that they can learn from as we make this shift.</p>

<p><a href="http://spec.open.referral.adopta.agency/definition/diff/">I am working on version 1.1 of the API definition&nbsp;for the human services data specification (HSDS)</a>, and I needed some help articulating the differences between version 1.0 and 1.1, which are both defined using the OpenAPI 2.0 specification. I manage all of my OpenAPIs using Github, but I needed a friendlier way to show the diff between two JSON files, than what Github provides. I got to work on a version that would run using Liquid, that would work in Jekyll, which all my sites and tools run in.</p>
<p>I have a variety of API documentation tools that run on Github, so I wanted to develop an interface that showed two separate OpenAPI definitions side by side on a simple HTML page, so at this stage, I'm playing with different ways of showing the differences between paths, and other elements of the API definition. I'm not entirely happy with what I have, but I started applying a red DIFF label to any path that isn't represented in the previous API definition. It works well for helping me see which API endpoints have been added or changed in the latest version.</p>
<p>Currently, I am just looking to understand the differences in paths available, but I will be diff for headers, parameters, and other elements of the API definition. I'm worried about things getting too cluttered with bigger API definitions. I'm trying to keep things fast loading, and something I can work with non-developers on, so I want to be thoughtful about what I add, and how I add it to the layout. I'm looking to get a group of business users up to speed on where things are going with the spec, and encourage them to get more involved with future versions--so not scaring them off is an important part of this conversation.</p>
<p>I am finding Jekyll, Liquid, and HTML, with a little JavaScript when necessary to be a perfect medium for developing OpenAPI tooling on top of. It provides a simple, static, and a flexible way to craft API tooling, that can be forked by anyone. As my proficiency with Liquid evolves, I'm getting better at making it work with OpenAPI YAML which is mounted via Jekyll. With everything operating on Github, version control and API access to all my files are adding a valuable layer to my work. Now that I have several of these types of tools available, also I need to get more organized about how I'm evolving the&nbsp;code&nbsp;and maintaining a catalog of these offerings so that others can put to use in their API operations.</p>

        <span class="post-date">12 Apr 2017</span>
        <p><a href="http://google.stack.network/">I have been profiling all of the Google APIs lately</a>, a process that always yields a significant amount of stories for my notebook. One element of Google's approach to delivering APIs that <a href="https://developers.google.com/+/web/">I found relevant in the Google+ portal, was their embeddable tooling</a>. This is an area of the API lifecycle I'm regularly evangelizing, and always looking for good examples to support my research.</p>
<p>I think that the six embeddable tools Google offers up as part of their social API represent the top embeddable tooling I see across this space. Partially because of the dominance of social media platform, but also because they make sense to end-users, and accomplish common things that people want to accomplish online.</p>
<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/+/web/"><img style="padding: 10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/google_embeddables.png" alt="" width="98%" /></a></p>
<p>Share, follow, and vote buttons are relevant to any platform with user accounts. Is yours available via API, enabling this type of tools? Then the badges, snippets, and embedded posts are relevant to any company, organization, institution, and agency looking to share content over the web (everyone wants to do this). I'm going to start a list of essential embeddable building blocks, providing a getting started list for companies looking to develop embeddable tooling for their consumers--Google gives me another good reference to add to my research.</p>
<p>I wish someone would start an API embeddables service, something like Zapier, but for embeddable content, tooling, and actions. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/02/08/api-embeddables-in-a-conversational-interface-world/">I've talked about this in terms of conversational interfaces</a>, but think there is an opportunity to do specifically for API-driven content. Allowing people to easily authenticate, and generate profile badges, embeddable content listings and details, and other long tail content opportunities. I'll keep beating this drum until something emerges--because it is what I do.</p>

        <span class="post-date">12 Apr 2017</span>
        <p><a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/working-with-templates-cfn-designer.html"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/aws_cloud_formation_designer.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I'm always on the hunt for new ways to define, design, deploy, and manage API infrastructure, and thought the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/working-with-templates-cfn-designer.html">AWS Cloud Formation Designer</a> provides a nice look at where things might be headed.&nbsp;<span>AWS CloudFormation Designer (Designer) is a graphic tool for creating, viewing, and modifying AWS CloudFormation templates, which translates pretty nicely to managing your API infrastructure as well.</span></p>
<p><span>While the AWS Cloud Formation Designer spans all AWS services, all the elements are there for managing all the core stops along the API life cycle liked definition, design, DNS, deployment, management, monitoring, and others. Each of the Amazon services is available with a listing of each element available for the service, complete with all the inputs and outputs as connectors on the icons. Since all the AWS services are APIs, it's basically a drag and drop interface for mapping out how you use these APIs to define, design, deploy and manage your API infrastructure.</span></p>
<p>Using the design tool you can create templates for governing the deployment and management of API infrastructure&nbsp;by your team, partners, and other customers. This approach to defining the API life cycle is the closest I've seen to what stimulated <a href="http://subway.map.apievangelist.com/">my API subway map work</a>, which became&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/11/29/the-api-lifecycle-my-talk-from-defrag-and-apistrat/">the subject of my keynotes at APIStrat in Austin, TX</a>. It allows API architects and providers to templatize their approaches to delivering API infrastructure, in a way that is plug and play, and evolvable using the underlying JSON or YAML templates--right alongside the OpenAPI templates, we are crafting for each individual API.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;AWS Cloud Formation Designer is a drag and drop UI for <a href="http://amazon.web.services.stack.network/">the entire AWS API stack</a>. It is something that could easily be applied to <a href="http://google.stack.network/">Google's API stack</a>, Microsoft, or any other stack you define--something that could easily be done <a href="http://apisjson.org">using APIs.json</a>, developing another layer of templating for which resource types are available in the designer, as well as the formation templates generated by the design tool itself. There should be an open source "API formation designer" available, that could span cloud providers, allowing architects to define which resources are available in their toolbox--that anyone could fork and run in their environment.</p>
<p>I like where AWS is headed with their&nbsp;Cloud Formation Designer. It's another approach to providing full lifecycle tooling for use in the API space. It almost reminds me of Yahoo Pipes for the AWS Cloud, which triggers awkward feels for me. I'm hoping it is a glimpse of what's to come, and someone steps up with an even more attractive drag and drop version, that helps folks work with API-driven&nbsp;infrastructure no matter where it runs--maybe Google will get to work on something. They seem to be real big on supporting infrastructure that runs in any cloud environment. *wink wink*</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2017/04/12/exploring-github-curated-galleries/">Exploring Github Curated Galleries</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">12 Apr 2017</span>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/explore"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/github_explore_showcases.png" alt="" width="50%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Github has long been my number one source for discovering people doing interesting things with APIs. As I was trying to articulate how API providers can put Github to work as part of their API operations in another story, I came across <a href="https://github.com/explore">the Github Explore section</a>. I thought that the list of items on the home page helps demonstrate that Github is more than just about managing open source code--which is the common perception regarding what you do with Github amongst muggles.</p>
<p>I feel that these nine areas reflect the top uses for Github in 2017:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/showcases/policies">Policies</a></strong> - From federal governments to corporations to student clubs, groups of all sizes are using GitHub to share, discuss, and improve laws.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/showcases/tools-for-open-source">Tools for Open Source</a></strong> - Software to make running your open source project a little bit easier.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/showcases/open-source-organizations">Open source organizations</a> </strong>- A showcase of organizations showcasing their open source projects.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/showcases/design-essentials">Design essentials</a> -</strong> This collection of design libraries are the best on the web, and will complete your toolset for designing stunning products.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/showcases/social-impact">Social Impact</a> -</strong> Open source projects that are making the world a better place.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/showcases/open-data">Open data</a> -</strong> Examples of using GitHub to store, publish and collaborate on open, machine-readable datasets.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/showcases/package-managers">Package managers</a> -</strong> Across programming languages and platforms, these popular package managers make it easy to distribute reusable libraries and plugins.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/showcases/devops-tools">DevOps tools</a> -</strong> These tools help you manage servers and deploy happier and more often with more confidence.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/showcases/machine-learning">Machine learning</a> -</strong> Laying the foundations for Skynet</li>
</ul>
<p>There are other galleries available via <a href="https://github.com/explore">the Github Explore section</a>, but I think this list provides a nice snapshot. I was pleased to see open data as a showcase, which included the <a href="https://apis.guru/">APIs.guru API directory</a>, something I'd like to see become an entire category of API catalogs and directories. It also makes sense that the foundations for Skynet are being laid using Github as part of its machine learning showcase.</p>
<p>It is important to also note that the first area on this list is policies. Providing some important leadership for city, state, and federal government agencies to follow when it comes to crafting policy in an observable way via Github. While not an antidote for all the illnesses of government, it provides an environment where the sunshine&nbsp;can be let in to disinfect the process just a bit.</p>
<p>While code is still the central focus of engagement on Github, I think the open data,&nbsp;machine learning, and policy galleries reflect the shifting landscape of what happens on Github. I'm investing some time into crafting more Github 101 stories for API providers and consumers, and will also be improving my own discovery process using the social platform, as there are numerous signals to tune into these days, and the explore galleries is one interesting layer&nbsp;that I'll be keeping an eye on regularly.</p>
