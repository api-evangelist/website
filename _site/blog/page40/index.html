<p>I had someone ask me, if out of the 3<a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/companies.html">0 API reciprocity providers I track on</a>, if I knew if one of them offered white or private label services. I couldn&rsquo;t confidently say whether or not any of them did, and as I do with my other questions, the best way to find out, is to put it out into the universe, and see whether or not one of the providers will let me know, or one of them will do it.</p>
<p>It would make sense for companies like <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a> to offer a solution that would allow for any company to resell their services, and offer specialty versions of their API reciprocity, interoperability, and automation services. As more companies are operating online, spread across various cloud environments, the need for ETL in the cloud, or like I prefer to call them, <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/">API reciprocity services</a>, is only going to increase.</p>
<p>Not all companies will want to use a Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions, and would prefer operating on-premise, and like to offer the services to their partners, or possibly their customers--opening up the need to brand it themselves. If you know one of the API reciprocity providers that offer anything like this, or plan on doing it, let me know. I have some people who have been asking for it, and would be happy to tell more stories about it.</p>

<p>I'm reviewing the business models of many of the top API platforms over the last couple of weeks, and I&rsquo;m seeing some pretty interesting approaches to <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com">API monetization</a>. As I look through each API, I see that some platforms don&rsquo;t have their API monetization strategy together at all, while others are following the pretty proven &ldquo;cloud utility&rdquo; model handed down from providers like AWS, and then I see some who are continuing to standardize how we pay for, and monetize APIs--which makes me happy.</p>
<p>One <a href="http://www.convertapi.com/prices">interesting pricing page I reviewed over the holidays</a>, was from the <a href="http://www.convertapi.com">file conversion API, ConvertAPI</a>. They have a credit based API monetization approach, allowing you to buy a certain amount of credits on a monthly basis, or make one-time basis. Each area offers four tiers, allowing for the purchase of credits at a various rates. One thing I found curious though, is that your credits purchased monthly do not roll over, where your one time purchases do&mdash;I will have to think about the pros / cons of this more, before I comment.</p>
<p>The ConvertAPI also has a "<a href="http://www.convertapi.com/prices#CreditsCostTable">credits cost table</a>", providing an overview of how credits actually translate into actual API calls. Many file conversion APIs use a one-to-one rate for making API calls, while others cost 2, 3, or even 5 credits per each API call. I like this approach to defining API costs, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/11/12/an-api-for-developers-to-access-their-api-account-information/">when your API developer account includes a API for monitoring</a> account levels, it <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/02/a-market-for-api-developer-credits/">starts getting us closer to the API pricing standardization</a>, and the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/16/with-number-of-apis-continuing-to-grow-account-automation-will-be-key/">automation we will need to continue the growth of the API economy</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m finding a lot of individual API monetization stories as I go through this latest round of research. I&rsquo;m thinking I will have to spend a couple of weeks in February or March of 2015, step back and look at the monetization strategies of the <a href="http://theapistack.com/">700+ companies I&rsquo;m tracking on</a>, and hopefully provide some better analysis of where we stand with this vital layer of the API industry. Along with the work I&rsquo;m doing to encourage companies to create machine readable API definitions for their APIs, accompanied with machine readable licensing using <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>, I want to help encourage the standardization of API pricing&mdash;then who knows, maybe someday API pricing can be machine readable, allowing us to make real-time decisions on the APIs we use based upon cost.</p>

<p>As I look through the API efforts of various providers, I&rsquo;m always looking for the little things that can make on-boarding, and sustained integration with an API as frictionless as possible. One of the <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">building blocks that I recommend API providers employ</a> in their operations, is a page that explains API rate limits&mdash;providing vital information on how API resources are throttled (or not).</p>
<p>An improvement on the standard rate limit building block, can be seen at Twitter. <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/application/rate_limit_status">Inline in the Twitter API documentation</a>, there are details about rate limiting for that specific endpoint. This way, as you are learning about each endpoint, you can also understand what limitations are in place. A small addition that could prove critical, for any API provider, especially Twitter, who has some of the most complex rate limiting of any API I know of.</p>
<p>At first glance, something small like including rate limit information within each API endpoint documentation may seem insignificant, but think of it like bobsledding or swimming in the olympics, where the slightest adjustment can reduce friction in just the right place&mdash;giving you the competitive advantage you need. Taking a fresh look at the building block(s) Twitter uses around API rate limiting, is expanding my own thoughts on how any API provider can approach their own rate limiting, and represents why I keep an eye on API pioneers like Twitter, even if I don&rsquo;t always agree with 100% of their decisions around platform operations.</p>
<p><em><strong>P.S. </strong>Did you notice the picture is of the rate limiting information, within the rate limit API endpoint? That will be another story, as part of my expansion of thought in the area of rate limiting.</em></p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/12/21/making-sure-the-most-important-layers-of-api-space-stay-open/">Making Sure The Most Important Layers Of API Space Stay Open</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">21 Dec 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-open.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>APIs are a really tough concept to help folks on-board with. I have come to realize that people see APIs very differently, and most of the time, I think this can be a good thing. In a perfect world it would be nice if everyone followed the same standards, and used only the best API patterns, when designing their APIs. This isn't the world we have, and to help better engge within the world we have, I am working to tell stories of this dysfunctional but beautiful API space we have accidently created for ourselves, develop visuals that help us better quantify things, and potentially give little nudges where I can to move things in a better direction.</p>
<p>When I hear most technologists talk about APIs, I feel many are exclusively looking through a client / server lens. Your APIs is your backend server architecture, and then your client architecture that will be used to connect APIs to websites, mobile applications, devices, and other systems. When I try to talk about API copyright, projects like <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>, and <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, or educate folks about modern approaches to API design, deployment, management and integration in this client / server mindset, it can be very difficult to articulate some very important concepts. Not all developers, software architects, and business leaders are familiar with this very important, and the rapidly evolving surface area being defined by API.</p>
<p>To help convey some of my thoughts about this very important layer of the API space, I've created some new visuals that I can use in stories, slide decks, and my research reports. First I want to elevate the discussion beyond just client / server architecture, and highlight the importance of the API definition surface area that is present in the middle.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/api-architecture/api-architecture-one.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>When you are designing, developing, managing, and integrating with APIs, you use some very specific languages for developing your server architecture. We use programming languages like PHP, Python, Ruby ,Node.js and other languages to develop the server side of our API. In most scenarios, companies choose the programming language they are already using across their business, developing all server side architecture in a common language.</p>
<p>Inversely, when it comes to client side architecture, companies should work to provide as many possible programming languages possible, providing code samples, libraries, and SDKs for all popular platforms. This is the promise of simple web APIs, is that a well designed API will abstract away any language specific details present on the server, making it accessible in any programming language. Then the good API providers encourage integration, by providing a wide variety of client tooling as they possibly can, to make integration as frictionless as possible.</p>
<p>In the middle, for the API definition layer, modern API developers are defining their interfaces, using machine readable formats like <a href="http://swagger.io/">Swagger</a>, <a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>, and <a href="http://raml.org/">RAML</a>. Providing a machine readable definition of an API is proving to be critical for just about every aspect of the API life-cycle.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/api-architecture/api-architecture-two.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>If you have a public API, or publicly available mobile or Internet of Things apps, you have a public API interface. This layer exists on the open Internet, and as we go into 2015, this layer for all public APIs should be well defined. Developers are using this definition to integrate with their existing systems, generating client tools, and are powering testing, monitoring, and other critical aspects of API integration.</p>
<p>Your server architecture is critical to API operations, and while I'm not in the business of telling pople how to license server side code, I will encourage anyone to make sure and at least apply a license, and I personally believe in using as liberal of license as you possibly can. When it comes to your client architecture, I will get a little more pushy about how things should be licensed--you are asking someone to integrate your API into their business, existing applications, and the code you provide should allow for as much flexibility as possible, not imposing restrictions.</p>
<p>This approach also applies to the API definition layer. Your API definition should be as accessible, open, and flexible as possible. You are expecting users to bake your Application Programming Interface (API) into their worlds, and this surface area is the point at which your two business meet. You can keep your server side code as a "secret sauce", but your API definition, and client architecture should be as open as possible.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/api-architecture/api-architecture-three.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>I do not think that copyright should be able to be applied to API definitions, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/06/02/helping-eff-urge-the-courts-to-block-copyright-claims-in-oracle-v-google-api-fight/">my work with the EFF on the Oracle vs. Google Java API copyright case</a> reflects this. With that said, we don't live in a perfect world, and embracing the one we have, I encourage applying a Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC-BY-SA</a> or <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/cc0">CC0</a> license to your API definitions, regardless of whether or not you use Swagger, API Blueprint, or RAML. After you do, I encourage you to <a href="http://apicommons.org/index.html">add it to the API Commons</a>.</p>
<p>I've had conversations with people who claim that their API surface area is their secret sauce. First if it supports a public mobile app, is used on websites, or provides integration of external systems, and devices over the open Internet--it ain't a secret! Second your sauce should be in the delivery of services behind your API surface area, the actual wording, order, and other aspects of your definition should be open for anyone to use!</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/api-architecture/api-architecture-four.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>It is incredibly important that this layer of the API space is well defined, front and center in our conversations, and remains as openly accessible as possible. If you need a real world analogy to better understand the openness of this layer, <a href="http://apivoice.com/2014/05/23/restaurant-menus-as-analogy-for-api-copyright/">read my API copyright -- restaurant menu story</a>. Your menu is not your business, it will be the service behind the menu that truly defines your company.</p>
<p>The best example of this in action, within the API space, is around the Amazon S3 and EC2 APIs. If these API definitions were not openly available, and were protected under copyright, would cloud computing have ever happened? Would we have an ecosystem of tooling like Eucalyptus, to Chrome or Firefox extensions, that has helped us deploy global infrastructure, and build applications that have come to define cloud computing.</p>
<p>Please work with me to make sure the most important layers of the API space stay as open, and accessible as possible.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m profiling all the <a href="http://theapistack.com/">700+ companies I monitor across the space</a>, going through each one and defining their API program, evaluating the tech, business and politics of their operations. Part of this process is creating a Swagger definition for each API. I&rsquo;m not deeply concerned with getting each API definition 100%, unless I'm directly integrating with the aPI. For this round I&rsquo;m looking at defining just the surface area of the API, including each endpoint, headers, parameters, and body format, and leaving the underlying data model for another time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">publishing all of my API definitions to the API Stack Github repository</a>. I&rsquo;m using this as a staging area before I publish them to <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a>. Last month <a href="http://www.3scale.net/2014/11/apis-io-hit-front-page-of-hacker-news/">I create an APIs.son for 690 APIs</a>, and I&rsquo;m looking to generate as many Swagger definitions for these high value APIs as I can over the holidays. It would be much better if API providers generated, and maintained their own API definitions, but until that happens I&rsquo;m happy doing a little extra work to get us to a critical mass.</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/21/making-sure-the-most-important-layers-of-api-space-stay-open/"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/api-architecture/api-architecture-two.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>Feel free to use any of my Swagger specifications, all that I ask is if you update, or add to them, please commit back to the repository so everyone can benefit. Additionally if you have any Swagger definitions for your own APIs, or other public APIs that I do not have in my listings, please share. It is extremely important that all public API endpoints are defined in a machine readable format. I don&rsquo;t care if you use Swagger, API Blueprint or RAML, just make sure your APIs have a definition, and it is shared publicly. If it is one of your designs, make sure and also add to API Commons.</p>
<p>When I reach a critical mass of <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">API definitions in the API Stack Github repo</a>, I will publish a story on apievangelist.com announcing they are there, and do incremental pushes to APIs.io, so that these value APIs are part of its open index, allowing you to build API collections, and even your open API search engine. Its important that we all <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/21/making-sure-the-most-important-layers-of-api-space-stay-open/">work to define this layer of the API space, and work to keep it as open, and machine readable as possible</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m developing a common API for all the APIs I deploy via Docker containers, meaning that each API that I design as a Docker image, will have an API to control all aspects of deployment, and its operations. I will be keeping most of the surface area available in <a href="https://docs.docker.com/reference/api/docker_remote_api/#v116">current version of the Docker API</a>, but I'm thinking I will add a handful of endpoints, and maybe alter a couple of the existing Docker defined endpoints to better meet my needs.</p>
<p>To support my work, I need a Swagger 2.0 definition for the v1.16 of the Docker API. I wish everyone would create machine readable API definitions for their APIs by default, but until that is the norm, I will be creating myself. I&rsquo;m getting pretty good at writing scrape scripts for harvesting API documentation (if they are well formed).</p>
<p>This Swagger definition not 100% complete, but <a href="http://theapistack.com/data/docker/docker-remote-api-swagger.json">here is what I have so far of a Swagger 2.0 representation of the Docker v1.16 API</a>. Its on Github, so if you use this definition, and fix anything, or add parts and pieces i didn't, please submit back, so everyone can benefit from it. I haven't completed the data model for the endpoints, but I'm storing the JSON responses for each endpoint, and just need to set aside some time to finish.</p>
<p>You can find the <a href="http://theapistack.com/data/docker/docker-remote-api-swagger.json">Swagger 2.0 definition for the Docker v1.16 API on The API Stac</a>k, where <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-stack/tree/gh-pages/data">I publish all my Swagger definitions for the APIs</a> I integrate with, and monitor as part of my research. I&rsquo;m adding definitions all the time, so check back often, and if you have any API definitions I do not, feel free to fork the repo, and submit them via pull request. I&rsquo;m not just looking for Swagger, I'd love to have any format you generate machine readable API definitions in&mdash;it is important that all of this layer of the API space, is accessible, and machine readable, so please help make it so.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/12/19/on-being-an-api-broker-for-hackathons/">On Being An API Broker For Hackathons</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">19 Dec 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-hackathon.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I recently had a conversation with one of my contacts at a federal agency about a hackathon tour they are planning. The federal government doesn&rsquo;t call these events hackathons, they call them data jams, but for sake of this story I&rsquo;m going to call them hackathons, and also omit the name of the agency until they are ready to talk about the event(s) publicly.</p>
<p>This agency had many questions about putting on a hackathon, but one I found particularly interesting, and something that is in line with other concepts I&rsquo;m exploring in the API space, was the desire to assemble a stack of resources that developers could put to use at the event, along with their own agency APIs. They were concerned about hackathon teams coming to the event and having to spend a great deal of time looking for APIs, open data-sets, and tools to use in their projects.</p>
<p>Building on top of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/10/exploring-the-possibilities-of-being-an-api-broker/">other stories I've told about being an API broker</a>, I will be putting some thought into how I can possibly act as an API broker for this agency and their hackathon(s). I will set up a Github repository, where I will list agency APIs, as well as bring other relevant government agencies APIs and open data sets. I won&rsquo;t stop there, I will also consider what other private sector APIs, and open tooling that would help attendees be more successful, save time and ultimately rise to the occasion.</p>
<p>These thoughts are building on earlier ideas from Cyril Gaillard in his medium post titled "<a href="https://medium.com/@cyrilgaillard/i-dont-need-a-business-co-founder-i-need-an-api-broker-c9be536cf8fa">I don&rsquo;t need a business co-founder, I need an API broker</a>". My motivations are all about defining a new breed of evangelists who really understand the API space, and know where to find the best APIs, tools, and other resources. Then these API brokers can use Github to aggregate all relevant APIs, data sources, and tools or services into a single location, saving developers real time and money when building applications.</p>
<p>Maybe not for these hackathons, but in other API broker scenarios I can envision the API broker also signing up for developer accounts, organizing API keys, and finding other meaningful tasks that would save time, and increase efficiencies for developers. An API Broker would be in charge of managing all resources that a development team will need to achieve their objectives, as efficiently as possible.</p>
<p>As the number of APIs increase, I envision the concept of a single developer or API evangelist, for a single API evolving to a world where there are many API brokers, who deeply understand many APIs. Then companies, organizations, and government agencies can lean on these API brokers to help them build the best aggregate backend stack possible for projects, hackathons, and any other scenario where APIs will be put to use, potentially solving problems that these groups and individuals face on a daily basis.</p>

        <span class="post-date">19 Dec 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://hypermedia.apievangelist.com"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-hypermedia.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I have been spending a lot more time in 2014 <a href="http://hypermedia.apievangelist.com">learning, discussing, and telling stories about hypermedia</a>. Early this year <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/07/what-is-a-hypermedia-api/">I identified that hypermedia was moving beyond just academic discussion</a>, and entering the mainstream consciousness of the API community. I do not consider myself a hypermedia expert, and had a lot more to learn, and by moving hypermedia further into my regular research, over time this education would come.</p>
<p>At the end of 2014, my deep technical knowledge of hypermedia, and the nuances between each of the formats isn&rsquo;t there yet&mdash;I just do not have the production experience with any of them to know what I&rsquo;m doing. I can provide an overview of the technology, the various formats, and the people behind each movement, as well as point to some real world hypermedia implementations, but when it comes to getting down to the details I&rsquo;m just not there yet.</p>
<p>One of my readers, from a leading tech company recently emailed me asking for a <em>&ldquo;hypermedia pragmatist&rdquo;</em>&mdash;here is an excerpt:</p>
<blockquote><em> We have a lot of opinions in our organization about how we should implement hypermedia APIs.  I&rsquo;d like someone to discuss pros/cons of different approaches in our monthly API discussion group but don&rsquo;t want someone who only promotes one view (i.e., JSON-LD, HAL, etc.) or is extreme in their hypermedia views.<br /><br /> Do you know of anyone whom you would consider a hypermedia pragmatist?  Someone who understands the competing specs but is pragmatic about how to implement.</em></blockquote>
<p>This describes what I&rsquo;ve set out to be for the API space in general, being a pragmatists in the tech, business, and politics of APIs, and I guess I can "almost" call myself a hypermedia pragmatists, except I just don&rsquo;t have the implementation experience. I&rsquo;m sharing this story, because I&rsquo;m getting this question at multiple companies,&nbsp;educational institutions, non-profit organizations, and government agencies I'm in talks with.</p>
<p>Eventually I will get there, and obtain the experience in implementing each of the <a href="http://hypermedia.apievangelist.com/tools.html">leading hypermedia formats</a>, but until then I need some help. Do you consider yourself knowledgeable across the leading formats? Are you a pragmatists when it comes to understanding what is possible when it comes to API design, and the implementation? Are you nice, professional, and informative when it comes to API education, strategy, and execution?</p>
<p>If you are a hypermedia pragmatist and open to consulting, and telling stories from your engagement, please let me know.</p>

<p>I spend a lot of time field questions from people about <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a>. This is something I expect to be doing for the next 10 years, and happy to field questions about exactly what it is all about, and help educate folks about exactly where APIs.json it fits in to the overall API landscape.</p>
<p>A regular comment I get from technologists, and API savvy folks is <em>&ldquo;you know that hypermedia is a better solution for discovery than APIs.json?&rdquo; </em>To which I reply <em>&ldquo;yes I know, but hypermedia is a solution for the API world we want, and APIs.json is a solution for the world we have&rdquo;.</em> I would love it if everyone understood hypermedia, and designed and deployed their APIs with this knowledge in mind&mdash;something I&rsquo;ve spending a lot more time on in 2014, and will continue the push in 2015.</p>
<p>In the mean time, I intend to continue stitching apitogether thousands of APIs available out there, using APIs.json, allowing them to be discovered via open source public search engines like <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a>, private internal search engines, and IDE solutions like <a href="http://www.codenvy.com/">Codenvy</a>. We don&rsquo;t just need discovery solutions to find new APIs, we need ways to build collections of high value APIs, something APIs.json excels at.</p>
<p>Another thing that APIs.json does, that I don&rsquo;t feel that hypermedia provides a solution to, is the discovery of the other technical, business, and political building blocks like the documentation, code libraries, SDKs, terms of service, and other critical elements of API operations. This an area that APIs.json was specifically defined for, allowing the discovery of these vital areas, in addition to the actual API interfaces.</p>
<p>As I do with many of my posts, this one is crafted to be a cookie cutter response to these comments I get regularly about hypermedia vs. APIs.json, allowing me to just reply with a link to this story on my blog. Hopefully we can shift the tide of API deployments in favor of hypermedia, but the APIs we can&rsquo;t do this with, APIs.json is a healthy alternative, and I even recommend using it alongside hypermedia to provide easy access to the other critical building blocks of API operations, that technologists often overlook.</p>

        <span class="post-date">18 Dec 2014</span>
        <p><a href="/admin/blog/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-email.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Most organization I&rsquo;ve worked with, the Excel spreadsheet is the central way of storing, managing and sharing data, with email being the number one way to share these data filled documents. When I was doing data inventory at the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA), as part of the White House open data initiative, almost every piece of high value data I found was housed in a spreadsheet, and the data stewards who were in charge of this data, would email it to me when I asked for it.</p>
<p>To help data stewards go from spreadsheet to API, I<a href="https://github.com/kinlane/email-xlsx-to-csv-json-xml"> wrote an Excel to JSON converter</a>, that was available via a private email address. All you had to do to convert a spreadsheet, was create a new email, attach your spreadsheet to the email, then send it to the specific address, and when it was done processing, you&rsquo;d get an email in response, with links to a CSV, XML, and JSON version of the spreadsheet&mdash;unless it was a super complex spreadsheet of course, but this wasn&rsquo;t our target.</p>
<p>Over the last year, this concept has simmered in my brain, and I can&rsquo;t help but think how important both Excel and email are to the onboarding the data that exists across small businesses, the enterprise, organizations, and government agencies. Imagine if you could monitor all the email that flowed within an organization, and look for spreadsheets being emailed back and forth. This would tell you a lot of about how data is stored, managed, and shared across groups. This intelligence could then be used to help direct API efforts, and open data initiatives like the one I participated in within the federal government.</p>
<p><a href="/admin/blog/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-excel-icon.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I put this idea in my Evernote a couple months back, and tried writing about it a few times, and during a recent flight I added to it. You could go beyond just identifying data usage patterns across a company, you could also generate APIs from this activity. Anytime an email with a spreadsheet attached was intercepted, a reply could be sent giving them a path to an API that was created, education about how to use that API, including a spreadsheet connector for the API, so that the person could continue working in the tools they are most comfortable, but now the data would be centralized, rather than fragmented across inboxes.</p>
<p>This idea could easily be executed upon using the <a href="http://context.io/">popular email API Context.io</a>, which would allow you to store an organization's email, and provide the index you&rsquo;d need to discovery the spreadsheets you can use to develop APIs, and identify how data is shared across an organization, then develop educational strategies for evolving behavior. I&rsquo;m pretty confident that part of the next wave of APIs will involve this layer of data, across businesses, organizations, and government agencies. I&rsquo;d like to see services like this emerge, to help organizations understand how they use data, and provide the vital intelligence needed to help change behavior for the better, evolving everyone towards an API centric way of getting business done.</p>

<p>I personally depend on over 40 APIs, all of which I have to manage my developer account, apps, and API key access for. This can be a lot of work, and as I continue to add APIs to my stack, this work is only going to grow. Putting on my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/10/exploring-the-possibilities-of-being-an-api-broker/">API broker</a> hat, and thinking about a future, where you will need to gather and organize potentially hundreds of APIs, across multiple companies, things are going to start breaking down if we don't do something to bridge these services.</p>
<p><strong>Standard API Developer Accounts</strong><br /> First, API onboarding will have to always include a standard API developer account, providing a common data model, and approach to managing developer accounts. Luckily many API platforms use <a href="http://www.3scale.net/">API management providers like 3Scale</a>, so this shouldn't be too much work, but I still come across plenty of APIs who do not even have basic developer account building blocks like analytics, or billing management.  I wrote about this, <a href="http://kinlane.com/2014/06/05/google-accounts-as-blueprint-for-all-software-as-a-service-applications/">using Google as potential blueprint for how we could possibly standardize developer accounts</a>, and I know that <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/2014/12/02/using-json-web-tokens-as-api-keys/">service providers like Auth0 are working to help provide plug and play services</a> that address this as well.</p>
<p><strong>API For Developer Accounts</strong><br /> I recently wrote about the email API Mallet, a couple of weeks back, and how they <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/11/12/an-api-for-developers-to-access-their-api-account-information/">have an API for their API developer accounts</a>. This allows users to manage apps, their keys, as well as stay in tune with their API usage, and able to understand when they are hitting their limits, allowing them manage their access tier, and billing information programmatically. Imagine that, an API for accessing account resources?? API providers need to follow their own lead, and make sure all accounts have API by default--all aspects of your API platform should have an API in 2014, there really is no excuse.</p>
<p><strong>Automated Account Registration And Key Provisioning.</strong><br /> I&rsquo;m always pushing API providers to offer single sign for the creation of API developer accounts, allowing developers to sign up for API access with a single click, using their Github or Twitter accounts. This helps alleviate onboarding friction, and prevents developers from having to create yet another username and password. We have to go beyond even this approach, and begin to allow single API call, registration for API developer accounts. I want a way to just POST to example.com/auth, with my Github credentials, or other means, and have my developer account instantly setup, and my first app and keys returned. Account setup can be finished later, but this type of API account automation would speed up onboarding and the integration of applications.</p>
<p>These are just three of the ways that I feel we need to improve on the account creation, management, automation, and interoperability, for the APIs we are increasingly depending on. Since onboarding friction has been a stumbling block for many developers, and influencing their decision of which APIs they use in the past, I predict if API providers don't continue to improve on their API developer account workflow, developers will look elsewhere.</p>
<p>If you are an API provider, it can be easy to miss this layer of API integration, but us API consumers, and the growing number of us who are using numerous APIs, feel the pain. With the rapid growth in the industry, API account management will continue to grow as an area that needs a more sophisticated approach, and is something that makes the argument for using API infrastructure platforms like 3Scale, over hand-rolling your own API management solution.</p>
<p><em><strong>Disclosure:</strong> 3Scale is an API Evangelist partner</em></p>

<hr />
<p><a href="http://www.noaa.gov/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://federal-government.apievangelist.com/images/logos/noaa.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>...a group in the oceanography community was one of the pioneers of web accessible APIs. The original Distributed Oceanographic Data System (DODS) was created in the early 1990's, before the WWW! It defined the dods: protocol for requesting data and getting a response. When the WWW came along, it was revised to use HTTP and renamed to be the Data Access Protocol (DAP), partly because they realized its usefulness in a wide variety of scientific and other disciplines, not just oceanography. DAP is an open source project stewarded by a group called OPeNDAP. DAP was IMHO brilliant and amazingly far-sighted:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is RESTful (since before the WWW!).</li>
<li>Like JSON and relational databases, it defines a few data structures (e.g., scalars, multi-dimensional arrays, and database-like tables called "sequences") which can be used for an amazingly wide variety of data.</li>
<li>It includes a system for dataset-level and variable-level metadata (stored as a set of key=value). This is essential for the sciences, so, for example, the datasets can include a description of the dataset, and so that the units of individual variables can be specified (e.g., temperature units=degrees_Celsius) to avoid misunderstandings.</li>
<li>It defines a way for a user to request the structure of the dataset (.dds).</li>
<li>It defines a way for a user to request the attributes of the dataset (.das).</li>
<li>It defines a RESTful way for users to request a subset of the dataset (which is essential, since the datasets are often many TB each (the original Big Data!)). The method for requesting data from database-like tables is essentially SQL's SELECT FROM WHERE reformatted as a URL query.</li>
<li>It specifies the system used to return the data.</li>
</ul>
<p>So instead of having a thousand APIs for a thousand datasets, there is one API. (If I were to find fault with the current wave of Internet dataset APIs, it is the idea that every dataset should have its own API. That's a mistake. The DAP approach is far superior.)</p>
<p>There are several reusable data servers that support DAP (HYRAX, THREDDS, ERDDAP, GRADS, PYDAP, etc.) and numerous client software (including from within R, Matlab, ArcGIS). There are 100's of DAP servers in the world serving &gt;10,000 datasets. The same client software can work with any dataset from any of those servers. The next time you read about the IPCC and their climate models with voluminous output, know that the IPCC scientists use DAP to access and work with that data.</p>
<p>My reusable data server program, ERDDAP, uses DAP (and other protocols) and adds some additional features. Notably, you can also request a specific file type for the response (e.g., csv, htmlTable, xhtml, json, mat, kml, NetCDF). ERDDAP will generate that file on-the-fly. Thus, clients don't need client software; they can just get the data in their preferred file format. You can read about ERDDAP and try it at <a href="/admin/blog/ERDDAP">ERDDAP</a> can also make graphs and maps on-the-fly. A beautiful sample dataset is at <a href="http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/jplMURSST.graph">GRIDDAP</a>.</p>
<p>My division within NOAA also hosts an ERDDAP instance that works with the NOAA Unified Access Program (UAF) which seeks to make all of NOAA's data accessible via DAP servers. (We're far from the goal, but we're making progress.) It currently has &gt;5000 datasets. See&nbsp;<a href="http://upwell.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/index.html">NOAA GEO-IDE UAF ERDDAP</a>.</p>

<p>In the coming months I&rsquo;m doing some deep profiling of the API space, so you are going to see me reviewing the approach of more API providers in the space. My goal with API reviews is not just to showcase the company or service involved, but review the overall approach of the provider. You can <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/12/12/an-api-evangelist-review-of-your-api/">read more about my review process on API Evangelist</a>, to better understand my objectives.</p>
<p>The review in the queue today is from <a href="https://www.respoke.io">Respoke, a web communications platform</a>. When you land on the Respoke website, you see all the signs of a modern platform, starting with the simple single page app style website, but more importantly, they immediately tell me what they do, in a simple, easy to understand way:</p>
<blockquote><em>Add live voice, video, text, and data features to your website or app</em></blockquote>
<p>You wouldn't believe how hard this is for some of the APIs I review. If I have to spend more than 5 seconds trying to understand what you do, you've failed, and Respoke nails it, by both providing simple text, as well as visuals that help me understand that they are a web communications platform.</p>
<p>To continue understanding what Respoke does, let&rsquo;s take a stroll through all of the areas I focus on during any API review.</p>
<p><strong>Actual API Endpoints</strong><br /> I always start with the actual API endpoints when reviewing an platform. Respoke provides a basic set of endpoints, mostly for authentication of communications via the platform, but also managing roles, groups, etc. You can tell the API is new, and it doesn't have the telltale signs of a fully mature API that has been used for a while, but I know with Respoke, they are just getting going. I&rsquo;m not a fan of using POST, and relying on request data being passed through the body as JSON. I like simple parameter based design, with sensible usage of your verbs. I feel this approach makes an API more hackable by users, even non-developers who only know enough to be dangerous. It is not a show stopper, just a personal opinion of mine.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.respoke.io"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/respoke/Respoke-Web-Communications.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Developer On-Boarding</strong><br /> Respoke provides a simple, frictionless on-boarding experience, easing you in with a getting started that walks you through the platform, and the self-service registration flow you need to get started with the service. At first glance I&rsquo;d say they can do a little better job of explaining the authentication. I haven't actually hacked on it yet, but at first glance it seems overly complex, or maybe just could be explained better. Another thing I'd like to see is a simple FAQ that I can scan to be able to see many of the common questions that get asked, and educate myself about Respoke in one page.</p>
<p><strong>Platform Documentation</strong><br /> Like the API endpoints themselves, the documentation is simple. I&rsquo;d like to see a <a href="http://swagger.io/">Swagger</a> or <a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a> specs for the API, and some interactive documentation to go with it&mdash;in my opinion this is default for all platform documentation in 2014. I suspect as the API matures, so will the platform documentation.</p>
<p><strong>Authentication &amp; Security</strong><br /> As I mentioned above, I think the authentication strategy is a little confusing when you are on-boarding. I&rsquo;m guessing I don&rsquo;t fully understand everything about the security and authentication of web communications via Respoke, but I also suspect they can put a little more work into help new users understand how it works, get started with basic authentication, and then when you are ready, learn more about the advanced security features around platform communications.</p>
<p><strong>Code For Integration</strong><br /> Respoke integration is pretty focused on JavaScript, so my evaluation of code resources will be a little different than with other APIs. I&rsquo;d like to see other language libraries, but I&rsquo;m sure as the platform evolves, we'll see these emerge from the community. Respoke provides JavaScript and Node.js libraries to get going, but what I really like is the <a href="https://docs.respoke.io/tutorials/example-apps.html">example apps that they provide</a>, or as I call them starter kits . I think starter kits go well beyond just providing code, but also help spark the imagination of developers around what is possible. +1 in this area for the Respoke usage of Github&mdash;I consider Github an essential building block for any API provider. Beyond these areas, I would suggest that Respoke spends some time thinking about what Platform Development Kits (PDK) they could provide. Providing ready to go solutions for top platforms like SalesForce, WordPress, and other leading systems that would benefit from a seamless web communications integration from Respoke. Similar to the starter apps they provide, PDKs would seriously contribute to adoption.</p>
<p><strong>Direct and Indirect Support</strong><br /> When it comes to support resources, Respoke has the minimum viable building blocks need, providing indirect support via a forum, and direct support via email. This is definitely the baseline for any provider, but I would encourage the addition of a support ticketing system as they pick up momentum, and definitely start keep an eye on Stack Overflow, and engaging developers on their own turf.</p>
<p><strong>Communication With Community</strong><br /> The Twitter, Facebook, and Google+ social accounts are front and center for Respoke, and they appear to be active&mdash;nice. However the lack of a blog always makes me sad. I know that many providers don&rsquo;t feel they have the resources to publish a blog, and keep active, but for me this is one of the most important signals an API platform can provide. When it comes to communicating with your API community, I&rsquo;d say the blog is number one, and after that Twitter and Github are number two and three. Respoke has 2 out of 3 when it comes to the essential communication building blocks.</p>
<p><strong>Platform Updates</strong><br /> As I made my way around the Respoke platform, I was happy to see there was a <a href="https://docs.respoke.io/reference/changelog.html">change log</a> keeping developers up to date with what has happened to the platform. I would also consider providing some sort of roadmap, providing the other end of the platform update coin. Since Respoke uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebRTC">WebRTC</a> as core technology, it seems there should be some element of updates regarding browser support, and updates to the WebRTC format. I would also consider adding a status dashboard to keep Respoke users informed about the stability of the overall platform.</p>
<p><strong>Business Model</strong><br /> One of things I judge APIs on is their pricing, and whether or not the pricing page is front and center, and Respokes is. They provide you with a free tier for playing around, and sensible pricing tiers for you to grow into, with unit based pricing per minute and connection. How a platform wears its business model tells a lot about the underlying services, and Respoke is straight up about all of it. Kudos!</p>
<p><strong>Resources</strong><br /> When it came to supporting resources for the Respoke platform, there really were no case-studies, slides from events, how to guides, and other vital resources to help developers through all stages of development. This is one area I&rsquo;m pretty lenient in early on, because I understand that many APIs are just getting going, and it will take time for supporting resources to be developed properly.  My goal is to just make sure the platform is aware of the lack of general resources, and make sure it gets into the roadmap ASAP.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.respoke.io/#pricing"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/respoke/Respoke-Pricing.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Research &amp; Development</strong><br /> I always like to see some sort of forward leaning research &amp; development areas of an API, such as an idea showcase, or labs environment. I think Respoke touches on this with their starter projects, that don&rsquo;t just provide valuable code, but also ideas for how the service can be integrated with, but I think they could take this further. Respoke needs to bring their experience with web communications, and WebRTC to the table and providing leading examples of what is next for web communications. There are many proven ways platforms demonstrate where their platform, and supporting technologies are headed, and I&rsquo;d like to see more of this within the Respoke community, I know the knowledge and talent exists, they just need to showcase on site.</p>
<p><strong>Legal Department</strong><br /> Respoke provides the required terms of service (TOS), and privacy policy that outlines how the platform operates. I&rsquo;m not a lawyer, but after reading through their TOS and Privacy Policy I didn&rsquo;t see any red flags regarding data ownership, privacy, or the other hot button areas I usually see around the politics of API operations. My first take on the Respoke legal department is that they are operating a pretty straightforward technology platform, and are respecting the interests of both developers, as well as end user. The only area I would comment on, is the lack of branding guidelines and resources for developers to take advantage of. I expect that branding will play an important role in helping drive Respoke adoption.</p>
<p><strong>Embeddable Tools</strong><br /> Respoke has a built in advantage in the area of embeddable, with the fact that many of their core integrations will be done via JavaScript. Respoke is meant to be embedded, and developers can do this pretty quickly using the default JavaScript library, but I think Respoke could go much further in this areas by providing embeddable platform development kits (PDK) as I mentioned above, as well as an assortment of other copy / paste goodies, and possibly even a communication widget builder. Properly branded, embeddable tools go a long way in acting as a marketing vehicle for the platform, educating users along the way of the platform behind the tools they are using.</p>
<p><strong>Development Environment</strong><br /> After I signed up for my Respoke account, logged in, and setup my first application, I noticed that Respoke had a dev mode for developer to take advantage of when integrating into their applications. I&rsquo;m a big fan of sandbox or development environments, allowing developers to build in a safer, more comfortable environment, but then being able to easily flip the production switch in a self-service way, when they are ready. I&rsquo;d like to see more integration resources available to developers, that help with development, QA, and production issues, and even provide monitoring, testing, and other common integration building blocks we are seeing from providers like <a href="https://www.apitools.com/">APITools</a> and <a href="https://www.runscope.com/">Runscope</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Developer Portal</strong><br /> A simple, robust developer portal is a must these days for any providers, and Respoke provide a pretty standard account management solution, giving you control over settings, the ability managing individual applications, as well as your pricing and payment history. I&rsquo;d like to see more analytics, and other integration resources as I mentioned above, here in my Respoke developer area, but overall it provides the minimum viable portal developers need to be successful when integrating with an API--anticipating it will only get better.</p>
<p><strong>Balance and Consistency</strong><br /> Across the technical, business, and political building blocks of an API, I&rsquo;m always looking for balance and consistency. This might be in how they craft their actual API endpoints, but could also be in API documentation, code samples, or even storytelling on the blog. I&rsquo;d say that they are consistent in their API design, but as I mentioned above, I&rsquo;m not a fan of making requests a POST, using the body to pass values. While they are consistent in this use, I don&rsquo;t think its consistent with modern, web APIs developers are used to seeing. I think Respoke will achieve more balance, and consistency in their API design, as well as content and other resources available on the platform over time&mdash;they are just getting going, and it always takes a while to get firm footing in this area.</p>
<p><strong>Is It An Open API?</strong><br /> I&rsquo;m always hesitant to truly call an API &ldquo;open&rdquo;, until I peel back the layers of the onion, and make an assessment myself&mdash;just because an API is publicly available, doesn&rsquo;t mean it is open. After doing this, I can confidently say that Respoke is an open API. It is publicly available, self-service, with a straightforward business model, including sensible TOS. Only time will tell if Respoke continues to deliver their services in an open way, but the way they've constructed their platform so far, tells me they will.</p>
<p><strong>API Evangelism</strong><br /> Like the resources area, there is pretty much no sign of life to report on when it comes to evangelism of the Respoke platform. However, I do know they have hired an evangelist, I have a call scheduled with him, and I&rsquo;m confident this is another area we will start seeing activity. You can always tell when a platform as an active evangelist because the social networks are active, Stack Overflow and Quora are engaged, there are a steady stream of commits on Github, regular flow of stories on the blog, and lots of exhaust from conferences and hackathons they are at. I'm guessing the next time I take a look at the Respoke platform, this will be different.</p>
<p><strong>In Conclusion</strong><br /> That concludes my review of the Respoke API, across these 18 areas. I&rsquo;d give them a solid B for their efforts. The platform has some maturing to do, in the overall design of the API, and the supporting building blocks, but this is standard operating procedure. Respoke is just getting going, and are kicking butt in most of the essential areas. My only red flag is the lack of blog, but this is just one of my pet peeves. I need the storytelling heartbeat of a blog to help me get to know providers in real time. I do not have time to speak to all providers on a regular basis, and an active blog provides an asynchronous way to track on thousands of companies, and their API resources.</p>
<p>I think Respoke is notable because they are pushing forward not just an open technology like WebRTC, but all web communication in general. WebRTC is all about "Real-Time Communications (RTC) capabilities via simple JavaScript APIs&rdquo;, and I just as I mentioned in my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/01/the-contextio-api-and-thinking-out-of-the-box-when-crafting-apis/">post about what Context.io is doing to push forward SMTP, POP, and IMAP with web APIs</a>, I think Respoke is working do the same with WebRTC. They seem to have a vision, derived from years of experience in the field, and they are looking to deliver on this vision using not just JavaScript APIs, but wider web APIs&mdash;something I can definitely get behind.</p>
<p>Hopefully my review provides value for Respoke, but also the wider API space, and helps API providers understand how they can better craft their own API strategies. Respoke is something I&rsquo;d share as a blueprint for how you can deliver a communication platform using APIs, and I will be keeping an eye on them, updating my definition of what they do as they evolve. Look for more updates as I continue to weave Respoke into my <a href="http://theapistack.com/">API Stack</a>, as well as any of my other <a href="http://kinlane.com/projects/">API research</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong>They do have a blog at&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.respoke.io/">blog.respoke.io</a>&nbsp;(happy dance), and <a href="https://github.com/respoke/respoke/issues">you can submit tickets via their Github issues</a> on the Respoke repo.

        <span class="post-date">04 Dec 2014</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-sandbox.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>This is something I&rsquo;ve written about before in <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/11/05/api-sandbox-and-simulator-from-carvoyant/">API Sandbox And Simulator From Carvoyant</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/05/24/salesforce-adds-sandbox-templates/">Salesforce Adds Sandbox Templates</a>. However it is something I&rsquo;d like to formalize, and get some new API service providers helping out in this area, or encourage the development of open source solutions.</p>
<p>API service providers like <a href="http://apiary.io/">Apiary</a> and <a href="http://smartbear.com/">SmartBear</a> are providing some very interesting solutions for mocking, and virtualizing APIs from API Blueprint, Swagger, and RAML. What I would like to see is the emergence of standalone solutions, providing data sets templates, or whatever you want to call it for populating mock APIs for testing, and integration.</p>
<p>Think of it as <a href="http://www.lipsum.com/">Lorem Ipsum</a>, but structured data meant specifically for APIs, and specific API definitions, as opposed to static mock content for websites. Seems like you could easily scan a machine readable definition for an API, and see if any existing templates exist that match the definition. If there was you could easily populate the mock or virtualized API, if there wasn't maybe you could provide tools for easily building a template, in a way that it could the data could now be reused.</p>
<p>This idea for API sandbox and simulation templates, and for the<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/12/04/swagger-api-definition-mapper/"> Swagger API definition mapper</a>, both were ideas that came up in my conversation with John Musser (<a href="https://twitter.com/johnmusser/">@johnmusser</a>). They are ideas I&rsquo;ve had in my Evernote for a while, but bringing them up today reminded me that both ideas needed to see the light of day, and hopefully I can move them forward at some point.</p>

<p>I was having one of my long overdue check ins with API godfather John Musser today, and it reminded me of an idea I wanted to put out there, so while it was fresh in my mind, I wanted to share. I&rsquo;m applying this to my <a href="http://swagger.io/">Swagger</a> driven world, but should be applied to all of the common API definition formats like API Blueprint, and RAML.</p>
<p>I want a machine readable way to map APIs together across multiple Swagger API definitions, mapping a specific API path in one Swagger spec to another API path in an entirely different API definition. Once the paths are connected, you should also be able map specific parameters to each other. It also seems logical that for each mapping you'd want to provide some sort of meta data about the relationship, and maybe some sort of semantics involved also.</p>
<p>Maybe something like this already exists? IDK. I&rsquo;m sure that <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/">API reciprocity providers </a>like <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a> probably have their own proprietary approach to handling this, but I&rsquo;m looking for a simple JSON, YAML, or Markdown version of this. If there isn&rsquo;t something like this already out there, I may play around with a prototype. I&rsquo;d like to <a href="http://email.apievangelist.com/">map similar APIs in my email API research</a>, allowing me to bundle together similar resources.</p>
<p>Not sure how much time I will have for this in 2014, but figured I'd put out there, and see if I've missed something already existing in the space. Also, once something lives on my blog, it becomes a little more real, and the chances increase that I will actually move it forward at some point.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m playing with more data visualizations lately, trying to establish a dynamic set of tools that I can use in my storytelling across the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/network.html">API Evangelist network</a>. I've been focusing on using <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3.js</a>, <a href="https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/reference">Google Visualizations</a>, and other JQuery plugins I've gathered over time, for now.</p>
<p>During the Turkey Day weekend,&nbsp;<a href="http://subway.map.apievangelist.com/">I turned a subway map JQuery plugin I had found into an API</a>, and introduced some new ways I can easily use these visualizations in my <a href="http://hackerstorytelling.com/">Hacker Storytelling</a> format of publishing all of my research as Github repositories, <a href="http://kinlane.com/2014/11/16/public-frontend-and-private-backend-for-my-sites-on-github/">using the master branch as a private file and data store, and the Github Pages as the public face of the project</a>.</p>
<p>During the proces, I&rsquo;ve added the subway map to my visualization toolbox of JSON driven components that I can use when publishing my stories and research to Github, adding to my already existing tools like <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll posts &amp; data</a>, <a href="http://mustache.github.io/">mustache templates</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/">reveal.js slideshows</a>. I've also identified a handful of other visualizations that I want to add to my toolbox, providing a set of tools I can use to publish research reports, that deliver an open, rich, interactive, visualization layer on top of my simple JSON data stores.</p>
<p>In reality, this is just my own approach to lightweight application delivery, similar to what we all call <a href="http://spa.apievangelist.com/">Single Page Apps or SPA</a>, except I don't always adhere to a single page, or use a single framework&mdash;I try to keep lightweight, and a decoupled set of tools that I can mix and match to accomplish different objectives. As of this weekend the API Evangelist network is now over a&nbsp;<a href="http://kinlane.com/projects/">100 separate Github repositories</a> working in concert (or isolation), to help me achieve on my mission to better understand the API space, while hopefully helping others along the way.</p>
<p>As I work to assemble my API driven visualization toolkit, I&rsquo;m thinking I will start calling deployments a Single Page Report (SPR). While it won't be entirely true, as some reports could span multiple pages, I think the term still applies. Essentially an SPR can act much like the PDF gets used today when publishing most business reports. In my scenario rather than flattening the data, and resulting report, you would publish all the rich data, and visualizations to a single Github repository.</p>
<p>If you wanted to flatten an SPR, you could still publish as PDF, but it could also be interactive, forked, and have pull requests made to update data, correct any problems, and further enhance the visualizations. I just wanted to get this idea out there. I will work on generating a couple of "single page reports", to help better demonstrate my vision. And hopefully I won't actually end up calling it an SPR&mdash;I think I can do better.</p>

<p>Here we go again. If you were in <a href="http://chicago2014.apistrat.com/">Chicago for APIStrat this September</a>, then you know we are planning to have the next edition of APIStrat in Berlin, this spring. This round 3Scale and API Evangelist are partnering with APIDays to deliver two days of API talks at the <a href="http://apidaysberlin2015.apistrat.com/venue/">Humboldt Carr&eacute;, the Conference And Event Centre on Gendarmenmarkt</a>, April 24th and 25th, 2015.</p>
<p>I learned a lot attending APIDays Berlin earlier this year, and I am looking forward to continuing the conversation in 2015, APIStrat style. <span>Our speaker lineup includes&nbsp;</span><a title="Mandy Waite" href="https://twitter.com/tekgrrl">Mandy Waite</a><span>, Developer Advocate at&nbsp;</span><strong>Google Cloud Platform</strong><span>;&nbsp;</span><strong>Chris Taggart</strong><span>, CEO of&nbsp;</span><a title="OpenCorporates" href="https://twitter.com/countculture">OpenCorporates</a><span>; and&nbsp;</span><a title="Max Harlow" href="https://twitter.com/maxharlow">Max Harlow</a><span>&nbsp;from the&nbsp;</span><strong>Guardian Open Platform</strong><span>.</span></p>
<p>Of course we need sponsors to make the conversation happen. APIDays and APIDays can&rsquo;t make it all happen alone. We have some great sponsors who've stepped up early:</p>

<p>Make sure and contact us at contact@apistrat.com to help support the conversation, in Berlin. And like our APIs, APIStrat is powered by 3Scale.</p>
<p><a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/3Scale/3scale-logo.png" alt="" width="275" /></a></p>
<p>Without the 3Scale team, APIStrat wouldn't happen. As we prepared for the launch of the <a href="http://apidaysberlin2015.apistrat.com/">APIDays Berlin &amp; APIStrat Europe 2015</a> website, I was reminded that this is the 5th edition of APIStrat, and I think the 8th edition of APIDays, and I can feel that the API space is significantly picking up momentum going into 2015.</p>
<p>I think Germany, and Europe has a very important role to play in helping stabilize, as well as grow the API industry in a sensible, secure way that respects the privacy of the people who are using the apps that are built on the of APIs we are seeing deployed. This is the conversation we will be having in Berlin this spring, and I hope to see you there.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Dec 2014</span>

<p>This story gets file into the &ldquo;way in future&rdquo; bucket, because the infrastructure needed to make happen doesn't even exist. Beyond research from API grandfather John Musser (<a href="https://twitter.com/johnmusser">@johnmusser</a>), and a few other blog posts or conference decks, there is no standardization of monetization strategies and pricing across APIs&mdash;making my idea impossible currently.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t let that stop me! What I'd like to see is a developer credit system, that I can earn buy or earn credits for any single API, but I possess a credit account across all the APIs I depend on--as an API developer I want to buy credits for API usage, allowing me to buy in single, or bulk amounts, and apply against my regular API usage.</p>
<p>As an API provider, I could provide developers with an incentive using credits, trying to drive the behavior I'm looking to get from developers. With a credit system I could even pay developer's credits for doing common API ecosystem tasks like creating code libraries, generating how-to-guides, or even supporting other developers on the forum.</p>
<p>If there was a market for API credits, as a developer I could easily earn credits on one platform, and use them there, or possibly apply them to other platforms. I could also choose to just sell my credits on the open market to other API consumers, who might value the credits more than I do, or pay a rate that is lower than they'd get directly from a provider.</p>
<p>This is just a random thought I wanted to put out into the universe, that came up as I was evaluating the business models of some APIs I&rsquo;m reviewing. We have a lot of work before something like this would be possible, but if someone stepped up to work on this problem across providers, I think there would be a pretty significant opportunity for them in coming years--think Amazon Web Service pricing, but across the board for the API space, applied to all business sectors. #huge</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/12/01/where-do-developers-get-idea-that-apis-should-never-go-away/">Where Do Developers Get Idea That APIs Should Never Go Away?</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">01 Dec 2014</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-angry-mob.jpg" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>Almost every time an API shuts down, the tech blogosphere, and the social networks favored by the tech community erupts in comments resembling: That is what you get for depending on APIs, and APIs can go away at any time, you should know better by now, and you should not build a company on someone elses resources--just to name a few.</p>
<p>Where did this line of thought begin? Why do developers feel so burned when a popular API like Netflix, ESPN, or Google Translate is deprecated? The main reason is lack of communication. Developers need a long runway that an API is going to be deprecated. Something that will mitigate much of the backlash, but still the comments are never, why didn't Netflix communicate with us (they did), it is highlighting that APIs can go away at any point.</p>
<p>What other business in the world do you have vendors that do not go away? I cannot think of a single business, where you select a supplier of products or services you depend on for your business, without any chance of that company going bankrupt, shutting down, being sold, or possibly just discontinuing providing a particular products or services you depend  on.</p>
<p>I find it particularly interesting that this is an argument that continues to hold weight, and while you will hear me push back on API providers to communicate better around the deprecation of their APIs, you will never hear me say an API should never shut down, or you shouldn't ever use an API to build applications. Just like any other business area, you should carefully research your vendors, make sensible choices about why you use one over another, and when possible have contingency plans for your operations.</p>
<p>I would be curious to hear ideas about the possible origins of why developers feel like this. I can't think of any precedent that would have set this tone for the conversation, and after almost 14 years of the modern web AP industry, developers are still crying fowl, and the tech blogosphere still finds it relevant to stir up sentiment that APIs are not reliable because of these high profile deprecations.</p>

        <span class="post-date">01 Dec 2014</span>
        <p><a title="Context.io" href="http://context.io/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/context-io/context-io-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I recently finished looking through all of the email APIs available in the space, narrowing it down to just a handful of companies who I felt were worthy of showcasing as part of my <a href="http://email.apievangelist.com/">email API research</a>. Ultimately I felt seven were worthy of discussion, and after I laid them side by side all of them were very similar in the technology, business, and politics of their APIs&mdash;all except one, <a title="Context.io" href="http://context.io/">Context.io</a>.</p>
<p>Context.io isn&rsquo;t about sending or receiving emails via APIs, or simply focusing on email standards like SMPT, POP, and IMAP. Context.io provides you with storage and indexing of your emails, and then opens up a new API driven world where things are possible you never imagined. Extending upon existing standards like SMTP, POP, and IMAP with APIs like SendGrid has done is cool, but what Context.io has done represents truly thinking out of the box with APIs--which I love to see..</p>
<p>If you haven't noticed, I&rsquo;m a huge fan of evolving legacy standards and technologies using APIs, and I think there is plenty of room for this to occur across many business sectors, and layers of the technology world. I don&rsquo;t think every startup or existing company will have the imagination, or bravery for that matter, to do what Context.io has done, but I applaud their thinking, and would love to see others follow their lead when considering their entry into the API game.</p>
<p>Mapping a new set of web APIs to some very legacy processes, in a simple, easy to use way, takes skill and consideration for not just the legacy tech, but also how modern web APis are designed, deployed, managed, and evangelized. Doing the technical, while also deeply considering how people are using this legacy technologies, how they are embedded in our lives and business like email is, and then developing API driven solutions that solve problems for users in these spaces, takes a serious amount of work.</p>
<p>Ive known about Context.io and what they do for some time now, but the impact of what they do really became evident in my side by side evaluation of them with other email API providers before I had an epiphany about what they are up to. Then after spending time with their team at Defrag, over beers in the taproom, I was able to get a glimpse of the future they envision, building meaningful services on top of email, that truly make users lives easier.</p>
<p>I will continue keeping a close eye on <a title="Context.io" href="http://context.io/">Context.io</a>, and will also be hacking on their API to see what I can do on top of my own email stores, and I encourage you to do the same. If nothing else, use them as a model for how you can possibly think out of the box when designing your next generation of API resources, that consumers won't just love, they will come to depend on.</p>

        <span class="post-date">01 Dec 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/network.html"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/api-evangelist-metro-map-575.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>A long time ago I defined the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/network.html">API Evangelist network</a> using a subway map format, plotting out the different routes you could take, and the locations all along this journey. As with anything I do, this is a work in progress, and I&rsquo;m needing to regularly update this map. Currently it is in an image, and I use an image mapping tool to generate the links&mdash;something that is very time consuming.</p>
<p>I think the subway map is an important metaphor for understanding some potentially complex ideas, and provide a single map, complete with legends, supporting content, and links to more details. My problem is I have several maps I need to create, and maintain on a regular basis. Ideally my subway mapping tool would be dynamic, allowing me to make changes as I went along.</p>
<p>While looking for a solution, I stumbled across <a href="http://kalyani.com/2010/10/subway-map-visualization-jquery-plugin/">Subway Map Visualization jQuery Plugin</a>, by Nik Kalyani. This plugin would work perfectly for what I wanted to do to visualize the API Evangelist network, but I had another project I wanted to do, in which it somewhat fell short in satsifying.</p>
<p>There is a lot of talk about the API lifecycle, and I wanted a way to <a href="http://subway.map.apievangelist.com/lifecycle.html" target="_blank">map out the API lifecycle</a> as I saw it, but this concept isn&rsquo;t something there is a single answer for, and I wanted to hear other providers take on their own API lifecycle. I wanted others to potentially build their own API lifecycle subway maps, so I new that the Subway Map plugin needed to be dynamic&mdash;so I wrapped it in a web API.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still playing with what is possible, but my new&nbsp;<a href="http://subway.map.apievangelist.com/">Subway Map API</a> allows you to generate maps, adding routes, and locations along the routes. The API just takes advantage of all the features that Nik Kalyani added into the plugin, I just provided web APis for them. This project will be changing fast, and I will be resetting the database regularly, so if you play with it, make sure and let me know, so I don't step on your toes.</p>

<p>As I build out new APIs for use across my systems, as well as map out the landscape of valuable API resources available today, I'm <a href="http://apievangelist.com/templates/">working to define templates</a> that other API providers can follow when designing and deploying their own API infrastructure. I've accumulated 16 basic templates, prompting me to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/templates/">add a new section to the website called templates</a>.</p>
<p>These projects represent the templates I've established through my existing research, and will add other templates as they come off the assembly line. These API designs aren't mean to be the perfect solution for production environements, but to be seeds for new conversation around APIs, as well as providing a basic pattern you can use to start your own development.</p>
<p>Each API is functional, and has its own Github repository for storing of a Swagger definition, Swagger UI Interactive Documentation, as well as the server side code that I will open source with each template. As I move forward each template, I will publish changes to their repos, as well as maintain a roadmap via each projects Github milestones.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My APIs are currently developed in PHP, but for me the real value is the Swagger API definitions, and eventually I will also generate Python, Ruby, and Node.js versions of these same APIs. The code is disposable in my mind, and my goal will be to evolve each of the template definitions.</p>
<p>I intend to create cloud container images &nbsp;for all my API templates, providing blueprints others can use deploying on AWS, Heroku, Google App Engine, and othe popular cloud image formats, including Docker.</p>
<p>As I add features to my production versions of these APIs, I will carve these features off and add to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/templates/">each templates</a>. If you've taken one and added to it, feel free to share your patterns back with the community, and I'd be happy to showcase. I would also entertain the addition of any templates you would like to share with the community as well.&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">24 Nov 2014</span>
        <p><a href="/admin/blog/"></a><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/dpla-home-page.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></p>
<p>Not all companies who have an API are Twilio, where the API is the product. With Twilio when you land on their website home page, you are in API developer area by default, this is what Twilio does. Many other API driven companies like Twitter, provide link to the API developer program as a link in the footer of the main site, something developers have become accustom to finding.</p>
<p>Many companies I review, don&rsquo;t even have a link prominently listed on their site, forcing me to dig around looking for any evidence of an API. This story isn&rsquo;t about these companies, that is a whole separate post, this story is about the <a href="http://dp.la/">Digital Public Library of America (DPLA)</a> and how they have brought their API front and center by having the API present in the top level navigation, and listing their application showcase on their home page. This demonstrates that the DPLA API is something that goes well beyond just being a footnote in operations, and at DPLA it is something that all site visitors should know about--not just developers.</p>
<p>This may not seem like much at first glance, but when it comes to educating visitors of all types, that an API exists, it can be the difference between them knowing their is an API, or not. In 2014, APIs are moving closer to being a part of the mainstream consciousness and you shouldn&rsquo;t have to hide your API. Developers, and non-developers alike should know you have an API. If you want your visitors to potentially integrate with an API, use an application built on your API, or maybe even just spread the word about your API, consider moving it more front and center, giving your API more real estate on your home page, and make it a first class citizen in your site's global navigation.</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Nov 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-design.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>In the early days, there was just one API design tool to use, <a href="http://apiary.io">Apiary.io</a>. Now at the end of 2014, we have four separate API design tools to choose from. I credit Apiary.io for opening up this new era of API design, expanding the API life cycle, and emphasizing healthy API design practices over just API deployment and management.</p>
<p>In my opinion the expansion of APIs design formats, and API design tooling is extremely important to the space, allowing API providers to have conversation around API design with developers, and key business stakeholders, before development actually begins. However, the benefits of healthy API design, using leading API definition formats, goes well beyond just design, and the rewards can be seen throughout the entire API lifecycle.</p>
<p>There are three API design tools, from each of the providers of the modern API design formats:</p>
<table cellspacing="2" cellpadding="3" width="100%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><a href="http://apiary.io/"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/api-design-editor/apiary-editor.png" alt="" width="250" /></a></td>
<td><a href="http://apiary.io/">Apiary.io</a> - Collaborative design, instant API mock, generated documentation, integrated code samples, debugging and automated testing using the API Blueprint API definition format.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="http://api-portal.anypoint.mulesoft.com/raml/api-designer"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/api-design-editor/mulesoft-api-designer.png" alt="" width="250" /></a></td>
<td><a href="http://api-portal.anypoint.mulesoft.com/raml/api-designer">API Designer | Anypoint API Portal</a> - Enables the ability to design APIs in the RAML API definition format, and mock, preview and save API designs into a notebook, and integrate with other Mulesoft API tooling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="http://editor.swagger.io"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/api-design-editor/swagger-editor.png" alt="" width="250" /></a></td>
<td><a href="http://editor.swagger.io">Swagger Editor</a> - Allows the designing APIs in the Swagger format in both YAML and JSON, allowing you to import, edit, preview, and export API design docs.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>All three of these API design tools are developed by the creator of the leading API definition formats, <a href="http://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>, <a href="http://swagger.io/">Swagger</a>, and <a href="http://raml.org/">RAML</a>. (aka. Apiary, Wordnik, and Mulesoft). Now, a significant evolution in the API design tooling space has occurred and a cross format API design tool has emerged from the popular Java API framework <a href="http://restlet.com/">Restlet</a>.</p>
<table cellspacing="2" cellpadding="3" width="100%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><a href="http://studio.restlet.com"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/api-design-editor/restlet-studio.png" alt="" width="250" /></a></td>
<td><a href="http://studio.restlet.com">Restlet Studio</a> - Allows you to create, and load API designs in Swagger and RAML formats, save, and generate server side scaffolding, and client side SDKs in multiple languages.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The emergence of the Restlet Studio is significant because it represents the expansion API design tooling beyond the three leading API definition format providers, as well as being the first cross-format API design editor. There are other API service providers who deliver vital API services along the API lifecycle like <a href="http://smartbear.com/product/ready-api/overview/">Ready! API</a>, for mocking and testing your APIs, or <a href="https://apimatic.io/">APIMATIC</a> which generates SDKs, both of which support multiple API definition formats, but Restlet Studio is the first cross-format purely API design editor (correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be spending more time mapping out all of the tools that are emerging to deliver vital services throughout the API design life cycle, something that gives me hope for things standardizing when it comes to designing, deploying, managing, and integrating with APIs. It is an exciting time to be in the API space, as the universe rapidly expands, and more companies emerge to help us make sense of this rapid expansion.</p>

<p>I was reviewing an API over the last couple of weeks--I signed up for an account, came back several times, and made a handful of API calls in hopes of learning more about how the API works. This is something I do a lot, and it is always interesting to experience the on boarding process (or lack of) for APIs.</p>
<p>I first signed up about two weeks ago for this particular API, and within 48 hours I received an email asking if I needed help with my integration--that was nice of them. I like getting an email from the provider, and the more human it is, the better. At this point I didn't need any help, I&rsquo;m just playing, learning, and depending on the self-service resources made available to me via the API ecosystem.</p>
<p>About a week later I get another email, again asking if I need help. At this point I&rsquo;ve put down the API, but when I pick back up I might respond to the platform then, but I just have more learning to do before I have questions. Then about a week later, right before I was about to pick up the API again, I got another email asking me what my plans were, putting more pressure on me to share my plans for how I was going to be using an API, which I'm just not sure yet.</p>
<p>I am not your usual API consumer. I know this. However this API, I was actually planning on integrating into my core API tracking system at some point, so in addition to being the API Evangelist who might write a story, there is a good chance I will become a customer. I really like, and believe in the self-service nature of APIs, and while I like getting an email letting me know someone is home, I tend to be turned off by each consecutive email--nothing reminds you are in someones sales funnel, like a series of emails.</p>
<p>When you consider the touch points for your API on-boarding flow, make sure and think about the different types of users who will be registering, and the fact that not everyone will fit squarely in your perfect funnel definition. You want to make sure your API consumers know that someone home, and that you are there to help, but you really should rely on your self-service resources to get the bigger job done. Your initial email after I sign up should do this, then leave the next steps up to me, and be very thoughtful, and possibly dynamic with each engagement after that.</p>

        <p><a href="http://dev.mailjet.com/email-api/v3/metadata/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/mailjet/logo-mailjet.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>When I landed on the <a href="http://dev.mailjet.com/email-api/v3/metadata/">version 3.0 landing page for the Mailjet API</a>, the first thing I noticed was their API configuration API. Providing a set of API endpoints for managing my own API usage is definitely something I can get behind, and think it is something worth showcasing.</p>
<p>As part of the API Configuration portion of their email API, Mailjet provides five separate endpoints for users to manage their API developer account.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>/apikey -</strong> Manage your Mailjet API Keys. API keys are used as credentials to access the API and SMTP server</li>
<li><strong>/apikeyaccess - </strong>Access rights description on API keys for subaccounts/users.</li>
<li><strong>/apikeytotal -</strong> Global counts for an API Key, since its creation</li>
<li><strong>/apitoken - </strong>Access token for API, used to give access to an API Key in conjunction with our IFrame API</li>
<li><strong>/metadata -</strong> Mailjet API metadata</li>
</ul>
<p>I like this approach to providing developers with API access to their developer account details. It is an approach I&rsquo;d like to <a href="https://support.3scale.net/reference/active-docs">explore and standardize using the 3Scale API</a>. I think it is something I've written about before, but I couldn't find it.</p>
<p>API access to a developer account is something I haven't seen anywhere else, but I'll definitely be using <a href="http://dev.mailjet.com">Mailjet</a> as a blueprint for demonstrating what is possible, and see if I can&rsquo;t convince other API providers that it is a feature they should consider.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Nov 2014</span>

<p>As the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_v._Google">Oracle v Google API copyright</a> case was on its way to the Federal Circuit Court in 2012, the <a href="http://apivoice.com/2012/05/07/us-precedent-for-api-copyright-hinges-on-oracle-v-google/">EFF reached out to me for help in crafting stories of how important it is that APIs remain free of copyright</a>, ensuring they remain open and interoperable. I shared three stories, one on cloud computing and AWS APIs, the second on Delicious APIs, and the third on Instagram APIs, all reflecting three different scenarios that would never have happened if APIs were copyrightable.</p>
<p>A couple weeks ago EFF reached out again, asking for my signature again, on <a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/computer-scientists-ask-supreme-court-rule-apis-cant-be-copyrighted">another Amicus Brief to support Google&rsquo;s request of the Supreme Court to review the circuit courts decision</a>, and reverse it. As it stands right now, there is a precedent that copyright can be applied to APIs, and even though the case itself is moving onto the question of fair use, if we let the current decision stand, other companies can follow Oracle&rsquo;s damaging lead and sue for protection of their APIs--which is why we need to convince the Supreme Court to review, and overturn the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">very damaging</span> decision.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We expect that the Supreme Court will decide whether or not to grant Google&rsquo;s petition to review the Federal Circuit&rsquo;s decision sometime in January or February of 2015. So I need your help to stir up buzz around the issue, and post stories on your blog, call your congressman, and light up any other channel you can, to help educate people about the importance of the issue. When the Supreme Court takes on the case (which I feel strongly they will), we will need to regroup, and refile, a more expansive brief on the importance of APIs remaining free of copyright.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working to expand my <a href="http://apivoice.com/2014/05/23/restaurant-menus-as-analogy-for-api-copyright/">restaurant menu analogy</a>, to help people understand the importance of APIs, but if you have other analogies that you think would help the Supreme Court understand the separation of API interfaces, and their supporting server side or client side code, please share with me so I can work with the EFF to potentially include in the next brief that is filed. APIs are touching every sector of business in 2014, and if we allow Oracle&rsquo;s copyright claim to stand, we are in danger of pouring glue into the gears of each of these business sectors, at a point in time where we need to introduce as much lubrication, and transparency as we possible can, to ensure that the web, mobile, and Internet of Things applications built on APIs remain open and interoperable--ensuring they serve not just their platform owners, but also developers, and end-users equally.</p>
<p>Join me, in helping bring awareness to the issue, which right along with Net Neutrality, is one of the most important issues we currently face when it comes to deciding the future of technology, and how our society works, shares, collaborates and interoperates in this new online digital world we have created for our world.</p>

<p>You can find me in San Francisco tomorrow, at the Kabuki Hotel for<a href="http://www.sfmusictech.com"> SF MusicTech</a>. I'm <a href="http://www.sfmusictech.com/schedule/">moderating a panel, dubbed &ldquo;API Ecosystem&rdquo;</a>,  where I will be talking APis with Antti Silventoinen (<a href="https://twitter.com/Lamantiini">@Lamantiini</a>) of <a href="https://www.musickickup.com/">Music Kickup</a>, Justin Woo (<a href="https://twitter.com/jzwoo">@jzwoo</a>) of <a href="https://developer.paypal.com/">PayPal</a> / <a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com/">Braintree</a>, Steven Willmott (<a href="https://twitter.com/njyx">@njyx</a>) of <a href="http://www.3scale.net/">3Scale</a>, and Bill Hajjar from <a href="http://corp.senzari.com/">Senzari</a>.</p>
<p>I'm planning on walking the panelists through the world of API design, development, management, and focus on API monetization, but I suspect that we'll keep things pretty &nbsp;relevant to the experience, and diversity we will have present on stage. There is &nbsp;a healthy mix of music industry focused providers like Music Kickup, and Senzari (aka <a href="https://developer.musicgraph.com/">Music Graph</a>), but also API architecture provider 3Scale, and payment API pioneer Paypal / payment API startup Braintree.</p>
<p>You can catch the panel tomorrow at 2PM, in the spring room. Let me know if there is anything you'd like me to discuss with Antti, Justing, Steven, and Bill, during the panel.

<p>I've been crafting Swagger 2.0 definitions for many of the leading APIs i track on lately, and to help alleviate my pain and suffering, I&rsquo;m willing to write about your company if you write your own Swagger 2.0 spec. I&rsquo;m sorry, this is really important work, but it can be very grueling detail work, and I'd really like your help!</p>
<p>If you send me a 80% complete <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger 2.0 specification</a>, or for that matter, an <a href="http://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a> or <a href="http://raml.org/">RAML specification</a>, I will review your API efforts on the API Evangelist blog. I'm pretty adamant that all APIs today should have a machine readable definition in a popular format like Swagger or API Blueprint, as well as each API developer program possessing an <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.son</a> index of all of their APIs, including a reference to the machine readable API definition.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m determined to hand craft machine readable Swagger specs for the best APIs out there, and in time I will do this, but I could really use the help of API providers as well. Send me a link to your Swagger spec, and I&rsquo;ll make sure a story gets into my story queue. I would add a disclaimer, that you need to make sure your API offers value, and your overall effort is thoughtful, otherwise I may call you out on some things. :-)</p>
<p>Once we get to a point where all APIs have a machine readable definition, we will start seeing entirely new opportunities around API design, deployment, management, integration, and discovery. I'm determined to bootstrap the work that will help us get to this point, but damn, I sure need some help. T<a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane">weet at me</a>, or feel free to <a href="mailto:info@apievangelist.com">email me a link</a> to any machine readable API definitions that you know of. #thanks</p>

<p>It always makes me happy to see a pricing page, front and center when I visit an API, but I found an added bonus over at the email API, Inbox. At the bottom of their pricing page, they have a pretty simple question: <em><strong>Hey, why isn't this free?</strong></em></p>
<blockquote><em>
<p>It&rsquo;s become painfully clear in the past few years that if you&rsquo;re not paying for something, you&rsquo;re the product. In practice, this has resulted in &ldquo;free&rdquo; platforms that eventually were forced to show ads, sell user data, or fire-sale to a large company to only be unloved or shut-down.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re taking a different approach. The Inbox API isn&rsquo;t free. You pay us, and we run the service. That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>We know our pricing might still be prohibitive to some apps getting started. If you&rsquo;re a startup building on the Inbox Platform, please get in touch by emailing support@inboxapp.com.</p>
</em></blockquote>
<p>I like their style. I just don't understand the smoke &amp; mirrors when it comes to pricing in the API space, and fully support API providers who offer no B.S. pricing for their API resources.</p>
<p>It is little things like this that keep me trolling through the developer areas, and back alleys of the API space each day.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m lost in API monetization land, evaluating the business models of common APIs, so you are just going to have to cope with it, until I get through this research. Honestly, I really don't care this much about making money off of APIs, it is just telling me a lot about the motivations behind many of the APIs I keep an eye on. This particular story is extracted from my research into the monetization strategies of multiple core business sectors in the API space, and one of my regular conversations that I have, with an API provider around how they can settle in on a sensible monetization strategy.</p>
<p>In the same conversation around how these valuable resources even became APIs, we were immediately led to the topic of what we were going to charge for, and how we were going make money off these potentially resources. As I&rsquo;m discussing resources based API design, I&rsquo;m also having a resource based API monetization conversation&mdash;which tells me we are so lost in the infancy of all areas of API design, deployment, management, and ultimately monetization.</p>
<p>How these resources are going to be used? How will these API resources actually be put to use by end-users within web, mobile, and IoT applications? Seems like we should be considering the perspectives on how people will experience these APIs as we design the interfaces, let alone before we attach prices to them.  If we don&rsquo;t know ho they will be used, how will we ever know what someone will pay for them?</p>
<p>I just don't know the answer. I know that we have hard costs for crafting these API resources--the compute, storage, and bandwidth to serve them up. I do not know if anyone will even pay a dime for any of them, or even need them at all. Where do I focus? Do I concentrate on the resources that I have, and more about how to make them accessible, while also covering my overhead, and hopefully make some profit on top? Or do I focus how thinking about how they will be used, and the value they have with end-users? I can't decide on where I should focus: 1) resource based API monetization, or 2) experience based monetization. #help</p>

I&rsquo;ve been tracking on the <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">building blocks of API management since 2011</a>, and have expanded that to include API <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">design</a>, <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">deployment</a>, <a href="http://evangelism.apievangelist.com/">evangelism</a>, <a href="http://integration.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">integration</a> and other areas of the API lifecycle in the last 3 years. I'm working my way through the <a href="http://theapistack.com">700 APIs in my API stack</a>, I am looking for industry focused building building blocks, as well as the ones associated with an APIs business model, or monetization strategy.</p>
<p>I have almost twenty monetization building blocks I'm tracking on ranging from free access to the availability of partner programs. As I work my way through various business sectors being impacted by APIs, I'm starting to see interesting patterns, some of which can act as a red flag for me that there are potential problems within an API operations. To the uneducated API pundit, the illnesses around APIs arise from simplistic concepts like &ldquo;being public&rdquo;, when in reality there are deeper issues at play, usually around the business model, and these patterns for me begin to really get at the root of the problem, rather than just speculating on the cause.</p>
<p>An example of this has to do with the existence of a handful of management and monetization building blocks, and the absence of others--such as when an API does not have a pricing page, service tiers, or any paid infrastructure, but offers free access to an API. This is amplified when a provider also doesn't provide any clear rate limiting available, resulting in a service you do not want to depend on, because I can guarantee buried in the terms of service is a clause that they can start charging at any moment. The most well known example of this in the wild is Twitter, who despite having Gnip and DataSift, still does not provide clear and scalable pricing options for its developer.</p>
<p>As I continue studying the monetization strategies of APIs, I'll work to establish more patterns that are derived from the presence of, or absence of, specific combinations of monetization building blocks that may tell a larger story. Hopefully I can work to counter much of the BS in the space, and when you hear statements like &ldquo;public APIs are not viable&rdquo;, we can clarify with &ldquo;public APIs who don&rsquo;t have clear business model, and communicate their pricing and rate limits are not viable&rdquo;.</p>

        <span class="post-date">05 Nov 2014</span>
        <p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/docker-spreadsheets.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>I wrote a story about a company I&rsquo;m advising for last week called <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/29/now-our-development-environment-is-now-containerized-and-scalable-like-our-production-environment/">Codenvy, who is delivering modular, scalable, cloud development environments using their web IDE and Docker</a>. I'm currently working my way through the spreadsheet to API, and API to spreadsheet solutions I track on, and it is making me think that someone should deliver a <a href="https://codenvy.com/">Codenvy</a>-like containerized spreadsheet environment.</p>
<p>With this type of environment you could forever end the emailing of spreadsheets, allowing people to craft spreadsheets, complete with all the data and visualization goodness they desire, and clone, fork, share, and collaborate around these containerized spreadsheets. You could have a library of master planned spreadsheets that your company depends on, and manage user permissions, analytics, and even scalability, performance, and distribution of vital spreadsheets.</p>
<p>Using this platform you could easily spawn spreadsheet driven APis using services like <a href="http://bit.ly/1sgwGpq">API Spark</a>, and you could come full circle and have spreadsheets that obtain their data directly from valuable API driven resources, to really blow your mind. Personally I'm not a big spreadsheet lover, but I do recognize that it is where a majority of the worlds data resides, and the user interface of choice for many business folk--making it a good candidate for the next generation of containerized API data sources, and clients.</p>
<p>Just another one of my random ideas that accumulate in my Evernote, that I'll never have time to build myself, and hoping you will tackle for me. As I review all of the existing spreadsheet APi solutions available currently, I&rsquo;m sure I'll have more API centric, spreadsheet ideas bubble over t o share with you.</p>

        <p><a href="https://messente.com/"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/messente-sms-api.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I found the DNS implementation over at the Messente SMS API interesting, and worth of sharing for deeper evaluation. I've been <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/26/gathering-my-thoughts-around-common-patterns-for-base-urls-across-nearly-700-apis/">considering the various approaches by API providers when crafting their domains, or subdomains for API access</a> heavily over the last couple weeks.</p>
<p>During some research time today I stumbled across the M<a href="https://messente.com/">essente SMS API</a> which opts to provide two domains for making HTTP(S) requests of their API:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>api2.messente.com</li>
<li>api3.messente.com</li>
</ul>
<p>Messente provides a little disclaimer to handle the developer side of manual load-balancing these API calls:</p>
<blockquote><em>These two domains have the same final destination regarding the API functions. In order to ensure that your requests always reach Messente API services, please use one of them as primary and the second one as backup. Both API domains work as equal, but in case of any unexpected downtime with one of them (HTTP 5xx), the other one must be used on client side.</em></blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure this manual approach to providing API endpoints is the optimal path when delivering on the stability of your API, let alone the location of your resources, but it does provide an interesting contrast on the perspectives that are available out there in API-land.</p>
<p>Sometimes I feel like I should rebrand as API Anthropologist, as I find the approach of my fellow API providers more interesting than what I'd expect to find in a mature API landscape. This reflects the importance of showcasing what is going on, to help bridge to where we should be, rather than focusing exclusively on where we should be. (deep shit, man)</p>

        <span class="post-date">05 Nov 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://developer.carvoyant.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/carvoyant/carvoyant-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m digging deeper into my Evernote lately, getting back to those half written stories I have laying around, and next up is about the Carvoyant API sandbox and simulator. I came across their <a href="https://www.carvoyant.com/2014/10/31/free-connectedcar-data-candy-in-the-sandbox/">Free #connectedcar data candy in the Sandbox blog post</a>, and was intrigued by the concept of a simulator, not just for IoT related APIs, but potentially for any API.</p>
<p>Carvoyant provides a free API account which comes with a <a href="https://sandbox-driver.carvoyant.com/">sandbox API for playing with the platform</a>, and a <a href="https://sandbox-auth.carvoyant.com/login/auth">traffic simulator that allows you generate vehicle and trip data</a> for use in developing applications. I can see how a sandbox plus simulator is essential for developing automotive related applications, as you can&rsquo;t be expected to have real car connection and data in all scenarios, something clearly Carvoyant has put a lot of thought, and work into.</p>
<p>Providing an API sandbox plus API simulator seems like it could also be two essential building blocks required for all device based API platforms, aka Internet of Things. This approach would be significant in on boarding new developers, providing them with immediate scenarios they can hack against, to learn about an API, as well as light the fire within their imagination regarding what is possible with the platform's API.</p>
<p>I already have a sandbox as one potential <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">API management building block</a> that API providers should consider. I think I will also add a simulator to the API management building blocks, and keep an eye out for other API simulators in the wild. I know I&rsquo;ve covered <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/05/24/salesforce-adds-sandbox-templates/">sandbox templates from SaleForce</a> in the past, but usually once I&rsquo;ve seen something in the wild a couple of times, and add it as a formal building block to track on, I immediately tend see more of it out in the space. Have you seen any cool API simulators?</p>

<p>One pattern I'm seeing emerge on some of the API platforms I&rsquo;m watching from week to week are integration pages, showcasing the other 3rd party services than an API has integration with. An integration page is similar to an application showcase, but instead of showing apps build on an API, you are showcasing other platforms that are already integrated with.</p>
<p>A recent one that I&rsquo;ve seen out in the wild is from web development annotation platform <a href="https://usersnap.com">Usersnap</a>, showing the platforms they connect to:</p>
<p><a href="https://usersnap.com/connect"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/usersnap/usersnap-integrations.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>The second I came across was from <a href="http://www.opsgenie.com/">OpsGenie</a>, the alerts and notification platform, showcasing all of the common platform they work with:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.opsgenie.com/integrations"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/opsgenie/opsgenie-integrations.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to add an integrations page to my list of <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">API management building blocks for API providers</a> to consider. An integration page can showcase a wide range of integrations that <a href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com">introduce reciprocity into platform operations</a>. Integrations could start with using Zapier, but could also be seamless, providing plug and play connectors for users. I would say integrations goes right up to what I call platform development kits (PDK), which would be open source code that developers could use to get up and running on 3rd party platforms.</p>
<p>If you don't have any existing integrations to showcase, I recommend spending some time and figure out the top 5 platforms that would complement the value delivered by your API, and get to work integrating. Existing API integrations are great for stimulating the imagination of developers, as well as provide ready to go solutions for non-developers--either way an integrations page will help onboard new API consumers.</p>

<p>As I write up a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/11/03/the-expanding-api-universe-more-api-sdk-focused-services-emerge/">story on Magnet</a>, another one of the API SDK service providers to emerge in the space, I can't help but evaluate what other building blocks have the potential to evovolve, and be offered as a specific service. Machine readable API definition formats like <a href="http://bitly.com/1tnYxV8">Swagger</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/1cl8tCc">API Blueprint</a> make services like <a href="http://bit.ly/1qnXcI0">Apimatic</a> and Magnet possible, and I enjoy thinking about other potential services that could be easily generated from definitions in this way.</p>
<p>One possiblity that comes to mind is server side scaffolding, and the possibilities of generating server side scaffolding for your APIs in a variety open source API frameworks, using machine readable definitions. It is difficult to generate 100% of the server side of an API using machine readable API definitions, but you sure can go a long way in auto generating a scaffolding that will get you most of the way there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m picturing a whole library of every REST framework known to man (and woman), and the ability to select framework, and upload a machine readable Swagger specification, and the service generates a zip file, or publishes to Github for you. The service would save you the time of going out and finding the latest version of your favorite (or clients) REST framework, and do most of the heavy lifting in setting up, configuring, and crafting API endpoints. Eventually you might think about other ways to distribute, like docker containers on AWS, Google, and even PaaS services like Heroku.</p>
<p>It would be easy to use <a href="http://apis.io">APIs.io</a>, and the <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> files to find API design patterns, and make those available in a library alongside all of the available REST frameworks. I would build this myself, but I just don't have time, and it isn&rsquo;t an idea I think anyone is going to get rich off of, but I think you could make a good living charging a couple bucks to generate server side API scaffolding, and keep tabs on the latest REST API frameworks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll keep sharing these ideas that are generated from my monitoring of the API space, in hopes some of you take advantage of them, and bring them to life.</p>

        <span class="post-date">04 Nov 2014</span>

<p><a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/">Elasticsearch</a>, the open source, distributed, real-time search and analytics engine just announced that it is introducing a security layer on top of their API driven search platform.  Historically you have to secure any APIs exposed via Elasticsearch through your own proxy or firewall solution, now with "<a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/shield">Shield</a>" you can natively manage your APIs directly in Elasticsearch.</p>
<blockquote><em>Shield, in the same spirit of Marvel, is built on top of Elasticsearch public extensions points, and is easily installed as a plugin to add security features to any existing Elasticsearch installation. It does not require a different distribution of Elasticsearch, and relies heavily on the open public APIs Elasticsearch already exposes.</em></blockquote>
<p>The security Elasticsearch is bringing to the table reflects the core features you see in the API space from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.3scale.net/">API infrastructure providers like 3Scale</a>--providing the basics of what you need to secure access to API endpoints:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Role-based Access Control - </strong>Set granular cluster, index, and alias-level permissions for each user of your Elasticsearch cluster. For example, allow the marketing department to freely search and analyze social media data with read-only permissions, while preventing access to sensitive financial data.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication System Support -</strong> Shield integrates with LDAP-based authentication systems as well as Active Directory, so your users don&rsquo;t need to remember yet another password. We also provide a native authentication system, for those who want to manage all access within Elasticsearch.</li>
<li><strong>Encrypted Communications -</strong> Node-to-node encryption protects your data from intruders. With certificate-based SSL/TLS encryption and secure client communications with HTTPS, Shield keeps data traveling over the wire protected.</li>
<li><strong>Audit Logging - </strong>Ensure compliance and keep a pulse on security-related activity happening in your Elasticsearch deployment; record login failures and attempts to access unauthorized information.</li>
</ul>
<p>I've had Elasticsearch in the <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com/">API deployment research project</a> for some time now, but now I will add it to my&nbsp;<a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/">API management research as well.</a> If you can manage your API access, user roles, and generate log files for analytics from Elasticsearch API endpoints, the tool is moving squarely into the API management category.</p>
<p>I makes me happy to see open source tools like Elasticsearch improving their security features. Elasticsearch is something I recommend to government agencies to use when looking to open up access to document stores, using APIs. I would like to see more of the API management players working together to allow for interoperability between management platforms, but I&rsquo;m guessing this is a wish I won&rsquo;t get anytime soon.</p>

One of the new API management providers that have emerged is <a href="https://readme.io/">Readme</a>, who is looking to provide an attractive, simple, and intuitive way to launch developer portals for your APIs.</p>
<p>Readme reminds me of some of the landing page tools designed for web marketers over the last decade, to provide informative gateways for site visitors, but ReadMe is all about providing meaningful doorways to our API resources. First, I like ReadMe's definition of what is a developer hub?</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Documentation</strong> - Topical guides, tutorials and troubleshooting.</li>
<li><strong>API Reference </strong>- Low-level, deep-dive reference material.</li>
<li><strong>Community -</strong> Provide support and answer questions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Their definition of what is a developer hub is goes beyond just the technical documentation as what many developers see, and acknowledges that your portal should be about providing the resources necessary to educate API consumers, and potentially build community around their needs. ReadMe provides the essential building blocks I'd expect of any modern API portal builder:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Theme Builder </strong>- Easily create a beautiful dev community that matches your brand.</li>
<li><strong>Editor - </strong>Markdown-based drag-and-drop editor makes documentation almost fun.</li>
<li><strong>API Explorer - </strong>Let users play with your API right inside the documentation.</li>
<li><strong>Application Keys - </strong>Your users can view their application keys embedded right in the docs.</li>
<li><strong>Support - </strong>Let users ask questions and request features in the support forums.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then ReadMe goes a little further to include some concepts that I see in some of the leading API providers, features that go beyond just basic features, allowing you to better manage your API portal:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Collaboration -</strong> Crowdsource your docs! Users can keep docs current by suggesting changes.</li>
<li><strong>GitHub Sync -</strong> Keep auto-generated reference docs synced with your actual code changes.</li>
<li><strong>Versioning - </strong>Maintaining old or testing beta versions of your docs is a breeze.</li>
</ul>
<p>In 2014, emulating the social elements that Github has introduced into the world of coding, in your API program is essential. You cannot manage your entire API community by yourself, and including your developer in the process is essential. This adds relevant layers to the term "open" that everyone likes to use, providing the roots you will need to actually build trust with your developers, in something that goes both ways, and will also grow your own trust of developed within your own API community.</p>

<p>I'm keeping an eye on what ReadMe is up to, alongside the other API management providers I've been tracking on. I haven't give a lot of attention to the <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com">API management</a> space in the last year, as I've been focusing on the faster growing areas like API <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">discovery</a>, <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">design</a>, and <a href="http://integration.apievangelist.com">integration</a>, but now that I see new players stepping up, I will make sure and give the area equal attention in my research and monitoring.</p>

        <span class="post-date">03 Nov 2014</span>
        <p>I know. I&rsquo;m kind of a broken record this week, but I&rsquo;m trying to quantify the business model, and monetization strategies of APIs across various industries, and understanding what companies are charging for their services just makes me crazy sometimes. I don&rsquo;t know what people are thinking when they craft their approach to explaining what an API will cost to access.</p>
<p>Here is an example of what I&rsquo;m talking about over at <a href="http://www.stocklytics.com/">Stocklytics</a>. When you land on Stocklytics home page, this is what you see:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/stocklytics/stockyltics-completely-free.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>After spending some time looking for anything else about pricing, I signed up for the service, and after I logged in to my account I found this page, which then takes me directly to a Paypal page:</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/stocklytics/stocklytics-credit-account.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>Do companies even think about what this does to the on-boarding process? I&rsquo;m not evening focusing on the errors in my brand new developer account that I had to contend with before I discovered the add credits page. At this point, why would use this service? Even if the data is amazing? You just bullshitted me into signing up for your service. There was never a mention of cost until I signed up.</p>
<p>This is one of the things I love about the API space--the dead simple lessons in the value of honesty and transparency. I really don&rsquo;t care how you structure the pricing for API, I&rsquo;ll let developers vote with their usage of your API decide that. What I do care about is how you communicate your pricing. There really isn&rsquo;t any reason to hide your pricing&mdash;just be straight up about it, and I bet you&rsquo;ll do a lot more business as a result.</p>

        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-magic.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>When you look through as many APIs as I do, you start to get a feeling for many of the subtle signals, that can result in a wealth of information about the actual viability of an API. One signal I'm starting to track on more is pricing, and I'm gathering more details about how an API provider articulates their pricing, or often times doesn&rsquo;t. The way an API provider discusses their business model can tell you so much about their motivations, the amount of resources they have available, and the experience they have in managing APIs and engaging developers.</p>
<p>Pundits in the space love to talk about the viability of public vs private API, and that public APIs just aren't viable, and will be going away soon. When in reality the public vs. private discussion is not the issue, it is lack of business model, and monetization strategy that is the real tell in all of this. Public APIs like Twilio and Amazon do not have a problem, because they have put a lot of thought into their business models, and their pricing is well thought out, competitive, and front and center in their API developer areas--they aren't in danger because they are public?? DOH!</p>
<p>The companies who will be shuttering their API programs often do not have clear pricing on their site, reducing pricing to be simply a question in the FAQ, and something you have to request more information on.  Many companies are trained in sales techniques and are just looking to apply this knowledge in the world of APIs, but I&rsquo;d say for many of the companies I evaluate, hiding or obfuscating your pricing is not about entrenched sales practices, it is more about exploitation at every turn.</p>
<p>As I go through the <a href="http://theapistack.com">700 API companies in my API Stack</a>, I&rsquo;m tracking on the details of their business model, and will be judging APIs on how they showcase their pricing (or don't). I don't care if companies are still working to figure it out, or have top tiers that are &ldquo;enterprise pricing&rdquo;, and &ldquo;request more details&rdquo;. What I do care about is how communicative you are about your pricing, and enforcing that the pricing for API resources is one of the most important signals you can send as part of your API management strategy.</p>
<p>Remember, when you use Twitter as and example of how public APIs aren&rsquo;t viable, you are actually referencing the lack of a coherent business model that fully includes the developer ecosystem, and has nothing to do with the viability of public APIs. Public APIs are here to stay, but the smoke and mirrors of &ldquo;enterprise pricing&rdquo; will have to evolve if you expect to play in this new game, and actually get the attention of developers.</p>
<p><em>P.S. The magic wand is my new icon for "enterprise pricing", because I see the term being used as a magic wand for making up pricing, more than I see it used as viable sales cycles. I searched for images of pulling pricing out of your ass, but it didn't result in family friendly images I can show here, so I'm using a magic wand.</em></p>

<p>I'm just going to keep putting my ideas out there, so that y'all will build what is needed for the API space. In support of my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/25/if-i-could-design-my-perfect-api-design-editor/">API design tool</a>, and my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/24/someone-please-build-my-open-interactive-portable-and-visual-api-documentation-toolkit/">interactive API documentation tool</a>, I want a <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> generated visualization layer for APIs, using <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3.js.</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m envisioning a whole marketplace of visualizations I can choose from, driven from various popular APIs like Twitter, Crunchbase, OpenCorporates, and much more. There are number of proprietary data visualizations tools emerging out there (I&rsquo;m watching you), but what I'm looking for is specifically an open solution using D3.js.</p>
<p>I don't have a problem if there are premium layers, and features that are driven by commercial APIs, or there being added charges for API consumption in general, but I want the visualization, and underlying JSON to be open and configurable&mdash;encouraging access and re-use.</p>
<p>It can be tough to help people understand just exactly what an API is, and I feel like an open visualization layer using <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3.js</a>, driven from <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> would be one of the quickest ways to help people understand exactly what value an API can deliver.</p>

        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-dictionary.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going through each of the 100+ business sectors I track on as part of my <a href="http://theapistack.com">API Stack</a>. As I make my way through each sector, and generate <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a>, and <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a> files, the language of the resources used across a particular sector starts to come into focus. I&rsquo;m talking about the words used for crafting URLs, parameters, and the underlying data models for common APIs.</p>
<p>In a perfect world everyone would come together and use something like <a href="http://schema.org">Schema.org</a>, and work to extend, in an organized, collaborative way across different industries&mdash;I would call this the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) approach. Unfortunately what we have is a shitload of dialects popping up, driven from the dark depths of our legacy IT infrastructure, only seeing the light of day when an API gets exposed, and the dialect used by an isolated IT tribe all of a sudden becomes part of the mainstream world.</p>
<p>Some weeks my inbox seems to reflect where my research is going, and as I ponder the language used by popular news sites like NYTimes, USA Today, and NewsCred, I get an email from a reader in Europe, who works at the equivalent of BBC their country, who asks:</p>
<blockquote><em>Currently I'm thinking about the API vocabulary and i wonder if there is some kind of standard out there when it comes to the verbs, parameters, etc. that are used for Media/Broadcaster API`s. I think there should be some kind of standard (used by netflix, bbc, espn, abc, etc..) Do you have any idea if there is such a standard?</em></blockquote>
<p>If there is a schema.org for the broadcasting industry I&rsquo;m unaware of it. As I generate a crude dictionary for each of my API Stack business sectors I will stop, and conduct some due diligence on what is already out there for each industry regarding standards, etc. I&rsquo;m assuming if there is, it won't always be Internet ready, let alone API ready, but hopefully there is already something that is driven by the industry that can provide a starting point.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about the need for a common dictionary, when it comes to API design, in <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/06/25/if-i-could-design-my-perfect-api-design-editor/">my thoughts on a perfect API design editor</a>. I will work to publish any dictionaries that I aggregate, as they come into focus. As with much of the API space I suspect that dictionaries will be defined from bottom up, using common slang used in the space, as opposed to a top down from coordinated OED approach, but hopefully by aggregating and educating API designers we can make strides towards a more coherent API space in some of the business sectors currently being impacted by APIs.</p>

<p>Throughout 2014, when I look at the top 10 posts in my Google Analytics dashboard each month, there has been a consistent theme of what stories are driving page views. The concept of a page is only one metric I look at when evaluating where the API space might be going, and while I don&rsquo;t write stories specifically to page views, they do provide me with a general barometer of what my readers are interested in.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m seeing give areas consistently generating the most views across the API Evangelist Network:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Internal APIs - </strong>This slot is pretty much dominated by <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/">The Secret To Amazons Success Is Internal</a> story getting thousands of page view each month, even with being written back in January of 2012.</li>
<li><strong>Single Page App Tooling - </strong>Simple, easy to use formable single page apps like my <a href="http://csv-converter.publicprivatesector.org/">CSV Converter</a>, and my <a href="http://data.ongithub.com/">Data.Ongithub.com</a> produce some really long lasting traffic, providing value to users.</li>
<li><strong>API Design - </strong>This is definitely the topic of 2014, with all of my stories talking about <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">API design</a> tools like Swagger and API Blueprint dominating the top 10.</li>
<li><strong>Hypermedia - </strong>Its time has come in 2014, and hypermedia stories like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/15/what-are-some-good-examples-of-hypermedia-apis/">What Are Some Examples of Hypermedia APIs</a> are popular with developers, and non-developers when it comes to understand what hypermedia is all about.</li>
<li><strong>API Roundups -</strong> A pretty proven formula of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/26/payment-apis-that-i-am-watching/">rounding up listings of APIs for a specific purpose</a>, the only difference is when I do it, I personally look at each API and make sure there is something there, defining what I consider to be <a href="http://payments.apievangelist.com">API stacks or collections.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ll revisit this at the end of the year and see if it still stands up. For me it provides some sort of map of where my readers heads are at, and by no means is any measurement of where the API space is going, but is at least a place to start thinking about what is on people&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>I usually don&rsquo;t spend much time looking at metrics across my platform, but I see a lot of interesting trends, and I like being a transparent layer for the API space, so I think i will try to better track on some patterns I&rsquo;m seeing in my own network, as well as across the space, and share as stories here on the blog.</p>

<p>I was taking a look through the <a href="http://www.newscred.com/developer/docs">NewsCred API</a> yesterday and there was a parameter I have seen before, but find interesting, and wanted to share with you. It was a field called query_fields, which you could include the fields you wished to have searched, using a keyword provided in the parameter &ldquo;q&rdquo;.</p>
<p>You often see a parameter which determines which fields I get back with my response, but I like the concept of have a parameter to choose which fields I want searched in the first place. I think it is a simple, parameter based way to give developers more control over their API calls, in a way that will make sense to a wide audience.</p>
<p>Now I need to figure out a way to aggregate these simple little <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">API design</a> tricks and make them available to readers when they are designing their APIs. My goal is to help API designers make their APIs as powerful as possible, while keeping the surface area as simple as possible along the way.</p>

        <span class="post-date">29 Oct 2014</span>

<p>The production environment for delivering web and mobile applications has radically evolved in the last couple years, becoming more distributed, scalable, virtualized, and containerized. APIs, and new development frameworks are providing a smorgasbord of resources for developers to put to work, and devops is putting more power and control, throughout the development life cycle, directly into a developers hands. It is time that a developers environment evolves to keep pace with the environment developers are building applications for.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been talking about <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/04/07/containers-will-do-for-apis-what-apis-do-for-companies/">containerization in the API space</a>&nbsp;for a while now, something that is still a very manual process, so I have been looking out  for a potential development environment that matches my vision for orchestration with APIs for some time now. This is why I was stoked when I ran into Tyler Jewell (<a href="https://twitter.com/TylerJewell">@TylerJewell</a>) back in September, who introduced me to <a href="http://codenvy.co">Codenvy</a>&mdash;"a new SaaS developer environment that allows developers to create hosted environments optimized for creating, editing, compiling, testing and debugging applications authored in different programming languages&rdquo;.</p>
<p><a href="http://codenvy.com"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/codenvy/codenvy-api-ide-screenshot.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>At first glance Codenvy appears to be just another web-based IDE, with autocomplete, data source management, and Github integration. As you play with more you begin to realize you can configure and share projects, allowing you to setup environments, share and even clone them. Then you realize the whole IDE is configurable, clone-able, shareable, and scalable using the ever popular Docker, complete with API or CLI access to all work spaces, projects and files. This is the environment I was looking for&mdash;this is the orchestration I envision for building applications using APIs.</p>
<p>My head is swimming with ideas of how I can orchestrate application development environments now that both the development and production environments are containerized, scalable, bite-size goodness, complete with a Github layer in the middle. While many users of Codenvy will be using to manage their own devop workflow, I will be pursuing it to manage my own infrastructure, but more importantly using it as a platform to craft <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/01/28/virtualized-api-stacks/">custom API stacks</a>, share and publish publicly, and explore more opportunities around being an <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/10/exploring-the-possibilities-of-being-an-api-broker/">API broker</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">29 Oct 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://projects.eclipse.org/proposals/flare"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/eclipse/eclipse-logo.png" alt="" width="275" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Another layer to the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/29/now-our-development-environment-is-now-containerized-and-scalable-like-our-production-environment/">release of Codenvy this week</a>, was the <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/org/press-release/20141027_cloud_initiative.php">announcement of the Eclipse project Che</a>, an open source "project to create a platform for SAAS developer environment that contains all of the tools, infrastructure, and processes necessary for a developer to edit, build, test, and debug an application&rdquo;.  Che represents the next generation IDE that runs in the cloud, which coincides with other signs I've seen around <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com">API discovery</a> moving into the IDE with signals from API pioneers like <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/07/03/expanding-the-layer-of-api-discovery-from-with-the-developers-ide/">SalesForce&nbsp;and Google</a>, or from <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/08/19/bing-developer-assistant-for-visual-studio-delivers-relevant-api-code/">Microsoft in Visual Studio</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still learning about Che, but I&rsquo;m beginning to see two distinct ways Che and APIs can be employed. First lets start with the environment:</p>
<blockquote><em>You can build extensions for Che, and when those extensions are compiled into the kernel, Che creates server-side microservices, a RESTful API, and cross-browser optimized JavaScript, which is then pluggable into a browser IDE. With Che, developers are given the pluggable structure of Eclipse, but accessible through a cloud environment.</em></blockquote>
<p>This means you can orchestrate development workflows, with APIs. You can predefine, deploy, customize, maintain and orchestrate very modular development environment where everything can be controlled via API. What a perfect environment for orchestrating the next generation of application development.</p>
<p>Next I see APIs leading the development lifecycle as well, not just defining the development environment and process. Earlier stories I&rsquo;ve done on API discovery via SDKs, showcase SaleForce and Google providing native discovery of their APIs directly in Eclipse. In an Eclipse Che driven development environment, you could define pre-built, or custom API stacks, bringing exactly the API resources developers will need and bake them directly into their IDE&mdash;meaning APIs find the developers, developers don&rsquo;t have to find their own APIs.</p>
<p>This approach to API discovery via the IDE provides some various interesting opportunity for marrying with <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/10/10/exploring-the-possibilities-of-being-an-api-broker/">earlier thoughts I&rsquo;ve had around being an API broker</a>. I can envision a future where API evangelism evolves to a point where you don&rsquo;t just represent one API, you can represent many APIs, and configure API fueled developer environments for building any type of application. Think of what <a href="http://baas.apievangelist.com/companies.html">Backend as a Service (BaaS) providers like Parse and Kinvey</a> have been doing since 2011, but now think of pre-configured, or custom tailored IDE environments with exactly the resources you need.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just getting started with <a href="http://docs.codenvy.com/che/">Che</a>, and <a href="https://codenvy.com/">Codenvy</a>, so it will take me a while to work through my thoughts on using it as an API brokerage platform. The one thing you can count on me for, is that I will tell stories all along the way as I figure it out.</p>
