        <span class="post-date">27 Oct 2016</span>
        <p>Adrian Cockroft (@adrianco) turned me on to a DNS aggregation solution the other day while I was working on updating <a href="http://dns.apievangelist.com/apis/">the API definitions for the API providers that are included in my API DS research</a>. It was a very appropriate day for thinking deeply about aggregate DNS, with the DDOS attack against Dyn going on.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">DNS provider redundancy: the idea behind <a href="https://twitter.com/denominatorOSS">@denominatorOSS</a> - one API/tool for many providers to allow switching. /cc <a href="https://twitter.com/adrianfcole">@adrianfcole</a></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Netflix/denominator"><span>Denominator&nbsp;</span>is a portable Java library for manipulating DNS clouds</a>. It has pluggable backends, including AWS Route53, Neustar Ultra, DynECT, Rackspace Cloud DNS, and OpenStack Designate. Here is a good post on it from back in 2013, <a href="http://techblog.netflix.com/2013/03/denominator-multi-vendor-interface-for.html">describing it as a multi-vendor interface for DNS</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Netflix/denominator"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/68747470733a2f2f7261772e6769746875622e636f6d2f4e6574666c69782f64656e6f6d696e61746f722f6d61737465722f64656e6f6d696e61746f722e6a7067.jpeg" alt="" width="50%" align="center" /></a></p>
<p>There doesn't look to be a lot of activity around the project in the last year, but it provides a good model for what I'd like to eventually see across all the major stops along the API lifecycle. I picture a wealth of aggregate tooling like Denominator that can act as a broker between API service providers&nbsp;and help switch, migrate, and sync between providers whether you are deploying, managing, testing, monitoring, or dialing in your DNS.</p>
<p>As I read the multiple investigations into what happened with the DDOS attack on Dyn last week, it seems relevant to learn more about aggregate DNS API solutions like Denominator. I will spend some time looking for other similar open tooling that is vendor-neutral, as well as vendor-switchable. We are going to need open source circuit breakers like this to help route, switch, migrate, and sync DNS across many service providers in this volatile landscape.</p>

        <span class="post-date">27 Oct 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 5px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2016_10_26_at_9.05.40_pm.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></p>
<p>Managing developers access to an API is <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/">API management 101</a>. Managing the relationships between developers, and allowing for multiple users associated with an API application isn't something I have seen before. <a href="https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/build-together-with-app-collaborators-8162e31800f1#.e5cc4ci7">Slack just added the ability to add what they call app collaborators</a>--"<span>adding any existing member of your Slack team as a Collaborator, including members and&nbsp;</span><a href="https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/202518103-Multi-Channel-and-Single-Channel-Guests">Guest Accounts</a><span>."</span></p>
<p>The functionality felt a lot like the social aspects that made Github more attractive than just Git. When it comes to developing messaging apps and bots I can see a social layer doing pretty well. "<span>Once a Collaborator is added, they&rsquo;ll receive a notification from Slackbot letting them know they now have access to your app." Smells like an opportunity for API management providers to bake into user management solution, and if you wanted to take it to the next level, add a Slack messaging layer as option.</span></p>
<p>Its a small feature, but I think it is one of the things that made Github work, and could have a similar impact at the API management level, allowing for more engagement between users who are working together on API integration. I am going to add it as a building block for my <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/">API management research</a>, even if I haven't seen it elsewhere. It is something I'd like to see more of, and maybe if I plant the bug, more providers will implement.</p>

        <span class="post-date">26 Oct 2016</span>

<p class="p1">I am diving deep into the DJi drone developer platform, and one of the elements of <a href="https://developer.dji.com/guidance-sdk/documentation/introduction/index.html#api">the DJi Drone Guidance API that caught my attention was the data transfer control methods</a>. In this situation, the transfer control methods are designed for just the data being sent as part of the drone guidance systems, but I think it provides a blueprint that can be used across almost any IoT device connectivity.</p>
<p class="p1">DJI provides four methods for managing the drone data transfer control:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Start Transfer -&nbsp;</strong>Inform guidance to start data transfer.</li>
<li><strong>Stop Transfer -&nbsp;</strong>Inform guidance to stop data transfer.</li>
<li><strong>Release Transfer -</strong>&nbsp;Release the data transfer thread.</li>
<li><strong>Wait For Board Ready -</strong>&nbsp;Set callback function handler for hen data from guidance comes, it will be called by data transfer thread.</li>
</ul>
<p>The "wait for board ready" method acts as a sort of web hook, that can notify any application build on the API that data is now being transferred, opening up the possibilities for notifying a device owner, and operator that data is being transferred. To me, this can be a critical aspect of building trust that our devices have our best interests in mind, providing some essential transparency in the data layer of the IoT space.</p>
<p>Data transfer control APIs for IoT devices like this will not ensure healthy data practices. This implementation is designed to provide transfer control capabilities to the developer, it is now up to the developer to include the end users in this process. Many current mobile application business models do not incentivize this type of transparency, as you do not want end users, and often times 3rd party developers involved in data gathering, and revenue generation this valuable "exhaust" of Internet-connected devices.</p>
<p>I am hoping this evolves and changes as the Internet matures, and the number of connected devices increases. We need transparency at the device data transfer level, and we need all humans involved / impacted to be a literate, active, and will participate in the IoT data flow. I know many entrepreneurs think the end user isn't sophisticated enough to be involved, but this is more about your desire to keep any value generated for yourself&nbsp;than it is about the end-users capacity to grasp this stuff.</p>

        <span class="post-date">26 Oct 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2016_10_25_at_1.08.16_pm.png" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></p>
<p>Many folks see me simply as a cheerleader for APIs&nbsp;when in reality I am more of an evangelist for the bad that can happen with APIs. I believe that sharing of data, content, and algorithms using web APIs has the potential for good, but in reality, they are often be used for doing some pretty shady shit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An example of this is found in my inbox this morning, and I'm sure is something everyone will encounter at some point in their daily lives. It is an email for an undelivered Fedex package, which I know better than to click on, but sadly I think it is one that many folks will fall for.</p>
<p>Why do they fall for this? Because the email potentially has relevance, as I just ordered a handful of packages from Amazon, which were being shipped via Fedex (I do not order much online). Using the FedEx&nbsp;API, anyone can query the status of a&nbsp;package. I'm assuming that there are&nbsp;folks out there who are scanning for the presence of delivering notifications--I'm not up to speed on the details of how you can do this. I'm unsure if they can get my email alongside this information, but I don't think this matters. I think they can correlate data about where I live, and the fact I'm receiving packages--whether the email came from API, or through other forms intelligence, it doesn't matter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My point is more around the fact that APIs are increasingly opening up signals about our daily lives, providing a wealth of context for phishing campaigns, increasing the chance that people will fall for these attacks. My solution to this problem does not involve a knee-jerk response to providing APIs, I am just looking to just warn API providers that they should be&nbsp;monitoring for this type of behavior on top of an API, and we should help the average email users&nbsp;and Amazon&nbsp;package&nbsp;receiver that these dangers exist. Everyone should pause and think deeply about each link or file attachment we click on--no matter how relevant it might seem in our daily flow.</p>

        <span class="post-date">26 Oct 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/dji_phantom_3_pro.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I am going through the <a href="https://developer.dji.com/">DJi DJI drone developer area which has three distinct SDKs</a>, which allow us to leverage a variety of APIs that make the drone magic happen. I'm still wrapping my head around the intersection of drones and APIs, and this is my attempt to distil down what I'm finding in their developer area, and absorb some of what is going across the industry. This is not &nbsp;meant to be a complete list. It is meant for my learning, and hopefully yours along the way.</p>
<p>There are a variety of devices being connected to the Internet, but other than the automobile I don't think there is another object that is as complex as the drone. I'm fascinated by what is possible with this device, and the variety of APIs it has, the interaction with the RC controller, mobile device, and with other resources the clouds. I personally fly a DJI drone, so I am going through the DJI developer area, learning about their three SDKs, as they seem to be the ecosystem furthest along in their understanding the API potential -- think Twitter for IoT.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><a href="https://developer.dji.com/onboard-sdk/">The DJI Onboard SDK</a></strong>&nbsp;<br />This SDK allows for communication with the DJI flight controller over a direct serial connection, to monitor and control aircraft flight behavior with the Onboard API&nbsp;while utilizing the built-in Intelligent Navigation Modes to create autonomous flight paths and maneuvers. Some of the actions for the onboard SDK are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Activation -&nbsp;</strong><span>Before you start exploring DJI Onboard SDK functionality via our ROS examples, you will need to go through the "Activation" process.</span></li>
<li><strong>Obtain/Release Flight Control - </strong>Managing the process to get flight control.</li>
<li><strong>Take Off - </strong>Initiate a take-off&nbsp;for the drone.</li>
<li><strong>Landing - </strong>Tell the device to land.</li>
<li><strong>Go Home </strong>- Tell the device to go home.</li>
<li><strong>Gimbal Control </strong>- Manage gimbal for camera.</li>
<li><strong>Altitude Control -</strong> Manage the altitude for the drone.</li>
<li><strong>Photo Taking - </strong>Allow for taking photos</li>
<li><strong>Start/Stop Video Recording - </strong>Start and stop the video for camera.</li>
<li><strong>Virtual RC Control - </strong>C<span>ontrol the drone through serial port by simulated channel values.</span></li>
<li><strong>Broadcast Frequency Control -</strong> Manage which frequency drone is broadcasting on.</li>
<li><strong>Arm/Disarm Control -</strong> Arm or disram the controls.</li>
<li><strong>Timestamp Synchronization&nbsp;-</strong> Synchronize the timestamp -&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Native Waypoint -</strong> Manage the waypoints for mission.</li>
<li><strong>Hotpoint -</strong> Manage the hotpoint for circling.</li>
<li><strong>Local Navigation - </strong>Go to specified local position</li>
<li><strong>Global Navigation - </strong>Go to specified global position</li>
<li><strong>Waypoint Navigation -</strong> Manage flying through a series of GPS coordinates)</li>
<li><strong>WebSocket With Baidu Map (for navigation) -</strong> Real time mapping.</li>
<li><strong>MAVLink And QGroundStation -</strong> Managing the vehicle to air communication.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">These are the actions that onboard SDK open up, but the SDK has other layers, that go beyond the drone itself, and is more about the space and environment around a drone, and its interaction with this world.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Velodyne LiDAR<br /></strong>Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors are for commercial UAS applications, such as 3D aerial mapping, surveying, inspection, collision avoidance, and autonomous navigation in potentially either indoor and outdoor environments. There are three distinct elements of the drones LiDAR system:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lidar API </strong>- Supporting the computation of point cloud and logging LiDAR data in real-time into a standard LAS (LiDAR Aerial Survey) or PCAP (packet capture) file</li>
<li><strong>Lidar Simulator -</strong> A LiDAR simulator for playing back PCAP files in real-time via the same Ethernet output as a real LiDAR for facilitating development and debugging for the system integration</li>
<li><strong>Lidar Logging -</strong> An API based example to demonstrate how to use the API of real-time point cloud computation and LAS/PCAP logging. It can also be used for the use case of the integration of Velodyne LiDAR with M100 without the onboard SDK</li>
</ul>
<p>LiDAR opens up another universe within the DJI onboard SDK, allowing for access the system through API, manage the logging around activity, also simulating common navigation elements in the environment.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>uAvionix ADS-B Receiver</strong><br />The pingRX ADS-B receiver allows the drone to receive real-time traffic information broadcasted by other manned or unmanned aircraft, as well as temporary flight restriction (TFR) information broadcasted&nbsp;by the government. With this type of situation awareness, the onboard embedded system (OES) will be able to make some safety-critical decisions like collision avoidance or self-separation.</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>Precision Trajectory Mission Planning</strong><br />With the Onboard SDK Precision Trajectory Mission Planning suite, DJI developers can now plan complex missions without having to use GPS waypoints. The new DJI Precision Trajectory Mission Planning library has the flexibility to deal with complicated trajectories, issues with GPS accuracy and cases when GPS is simply unavailable.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Trajectory following library that can autonomously execute preplanned smooth spiral trajectories</li>
<li>SketchUp plugin to visualize trajectories, import 3D CAD models and geolocate the scene</li>
<li>Configurable speed, start/end radii and pitch for the spiral</li>
<li>Start your drone from anywhere - real-time path planning to get to the trajectory's GPS location</li>
<li>Integration with DJI Assistant 2 to visualize simulations of the drone following the trajectory in the SketchUp scene</li>
</ul>
<p>That is a pretty robust SDK. I'm taking the&nbsp;time to learn about each action, as well as the more communication and mission planning components separately. I can tell that they are having trouble to keep the large amounts of functionality and features coherent, and organized in the documentation, one of the reasons I'm breaking out separately here on my blog.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><a href="https://developer.dji.com/guidance-sdk/">DJI Guidance SDK<br /></a></strong>Guidance SDK enables allows you to develop vision-based applications, by granting you full control over drone guidance. You can access all output data for any device using the DJI Guidance SDK--they break things down into five separate groups.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Initialization</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reset Config -&nbsp;</strong>Clear subscribed configure, if you want to subscribe data different from last time.</li>
<li><strong>Initialize Transfer -&nbsp;</strong><span>Initialize Guidance and create data transfer thread.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><strong>Subscription Data</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>IMU -</strong>&nbsp;Subscribe Inertia Measurement Unit (IMU) data.</li>
<li><strong>Ultrasonic -&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Subscribe ultrasonic data.</li>
<li><strong>Velocity -</strong> S<span>ubscribe velocity data, i.e. velocity of Guidance in body coordinate system.</span></li>
<li><strong>Obstacle Distance -</strong>&nbsp;<span>Subscribe obstacle distance.</span></li>
<li><strong>Depth Image -&nbsp;</strong><span>Subscribe rectified greyscale image.</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Disparity Image -&nbsp;</strong><span>Subscribe disparity image, which can be filtered with functions such as filterSpeckles.</span></span></li>
<li><span><strong>Greyscale Image -&nbsp;</strong><span>Subscribe rectified greyscale image.</span></span></li>
<li><span><strong>Motion -</strong>&nbsp;<span>Subscribe global motion data, i.e. velocity and position of Guidance in global coordinate system.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Set Callback and Exposure</strong></p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/mobile_sdk_54b1bdda33.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<ul>
<li><span><strong>Event Handler -&nbsp;</strong><span>Set callback function handler. When data from Guidance comes, it will be called by data transfer thread.</span></span></li>
<li><strong>Exposure Parameters -&nbsp;</strong>Get stereo calibration parameters.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><strong>Get Data</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Get Online Status -</strong>&nbsp;<span>Get the online status of Guidance sensors.</span></li>
<li><strong>Get Sterio Calibration </strong>- <span>Get stereo calibration parameters.</span></li>
<li><strong>Get Device Type -</strong>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;Get the type of devices. Currently only support one type of device: Guidance</span></li>
<li><strong>Get Image Size -</strong>&nbsp;<span>Get the size of image data.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><strong>Transfer Control</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Start Transfer -&nbsp;</strong><span>Inform guidance to start data transfer.</span></li>
<li><strong>Stop Transfer -&nbsp;</strong><span>Inform guidance to stop data transfer.</span></li>
<li><strong>Release Transfer -</strong>&nbsp;<span>Release the data transfer thread.</span></li>
<li><strong>Wait For Board Ready -</strong>&nbsp;<span>Set callback function handler. When data from guidance comes, it will be called by data transfer thread.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>This SDK seems to be real time senses of the drone, allowing you to develop the experience you need to be in control, and guiding the device.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Data Types<br /></strong>One of the thing that captivates me about the whole drone thing is its data collection capacity. I'm still learning about what is possible with the drone itself, but I know that much of the value generated by these flights will be based&nbsp;on the data that is gathered, as well as the images and video recorded. Here are the data points I have found so far in the DJI documentation for the DJI Guidance SDK.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Error Code -</strong> Enumerates possible error codes. When error occurs, usually an error code will be given, and the developer can reference this enum to find the error type.</li>
<li><strong>Velocity Data - </strong>Velocity in body frame. The unit is millimeter/second and the frequency is 10 Hz.</li>
<li><strong>Obstacle Distance Data -</strong> Obstacle distance from five Guidance Sensors. The unit is centimeter and the frequency is 20 Hz.</li>
<li><strong>IMU Data -</strong> IMU data including accelerometer (in unit of acceleration of gravity g) and gyroscope (in quaternion format) data. The frequency is 20 Hz.</li>
<li><strong>Motion Data - </strong>Pose and velocity data including quaternion orientation, position in the global frame, velocity in the global frame.</li>
<li><strong>Ultrasonic Data - </strong>Outputs ultrasonic data from five Guidance Sensors, including obstacle distance (in unit of meter) and reliability of the data. The frequency is 20 Hz.</li>
<li><strong>Greyscale Image - </strong>Outputs Greyscale images for five directions. The image size is 320*240 bytes for individual sensor. The default frequency is 20 Hz and can be scaled down using API functions.</li>
<li><strong>Depth Image - </strong>Outputs depth images for five directions. The image size is 320*240*2 bytes for each direction. The default frequency is 20 Hz and can be scaled down using API functions.</li>
<li><strong>Disparity Image -</strong> Outputs disparity images for five directions. This data is useful when developers want to further refine the disaprity images using functions like speckle filter.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>This data is generated constantly by a drone, and you have control over this transfer process through the DJI Guidance SDK. I'm thinking I need to aggregate some JSON schemas for this data, to better help me understand the depth&nbsp;and relationships in this data. There is a lot going on here, and a wealth of data to consider in a wide range of scenarios.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>DJI Drone Mobile SDK</strong><br />I use the DJI drone application to operate my two drones. The DJI Drone Mobile SDK is where you can get to work crafting your own custom application, to deliver exactly the drone operation experience you want. This is what the iPhone application was for mobile, but this is for the consumer and commercial drone world. There are a wealth of areas you can develop around in this SDK:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://developer.dji.com/mobile-sdk/documentation/introduction/component-guide-flightController.html">Flight Controller</a></strong> - The flight controller is an onboard computer that combines control information from the pilot with sensor information to adjust the thrust at each propellor and fly the aircraft as desired.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developer.dji.com/mobile-sdk/documentation/introduction/component-guide-camera.html">Camera</a></strong> - The camera captures photos and videos. Many different modes of operation, resolutions, frame rates, exposure settings, picture settings and file types can be selected. Cameras have local storage to hold the media which will typically be an SD card, and in some cases an SSD (solid state drive).</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developer.dji.com/mobile-sdk/documentation/introduction/component-guide-gimbal.html">Gimbal</a></strong> - Cameras fixed to an aircraft will record images that pitch and roll with the aircraft as it moves. Multi rotor aircraft need to pitch and roll simply to move horizontally, and so getting a stable horizontal shot is not possible.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developer.dji.com/mobile-sdk/documentation/introduction/component-guide-airlink.html">Airlink</a></strong> - AirLink describes the wireless link between aircraft, remote controllers, handheld cameras and mobile devices.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developer.dji.com/mobile-sdk/documentation/introduction/component-guide-remotecontroller.html">Remote Controller</a></strong> - The remote controller allows manual flight, gimbal and camera control, and provides a robust wireless control link for aircraft. The mobile device can connect to the remote controller to communicate to the aircraft and receive the live video stream from the camera.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developer.dji.com/mobile-sdk/documentation/introduction/component-guide-battery.html">Smart Battery </a></strong>- Smart batteries provide the energy required to run the products. Together with the flight controller, the smart battery can estimate remaining flight time and provide warnings when low battery thresholds are crossed. Batteries are easily swapped between flights, extending product use considerably.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developer.dji.com/mobile-sdk/documentation/introduction/component-guide-missions.html">Missions</a></strong> - Missions can be used to easily automate flight. There are many different mission types that offer different product behavior. Some missions can be uploaded to and managed by the aircraft, while other missions are managed from the mobile device.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://developer.dji.com/mobile-sdk/documentation/introduction/sdk-guide-sdkmanager.html">SDK Manager</a> -</strong> Application registration to use the DJI Mobile SDK, product connection, debugging and logging services are handled through the SDK manager class DJISDKManager.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think that this stack of features speaks for itself. Providing a wealth of valuable API-driven resources to think about. This blows my mind as I begin to think about the possibilities&nbsp;for developing drone applications&nbsp;but gets even better when you think about how this also applies to the rest of the IoT world. Flight controller might not apply universally, but cameras, batteries, remote control, and the network are all ubiquitous with other IoT devices, and in my world should be considered beyond just drones.</p>
<p>I just needed to wrap my head around what programmatic resources are available to me as a DJI drone operator and developer. Next, I will be diving in and learning about some of the more interesting layers of this drone ecosystem, but first I am more interested in spending time looking through the platform API and SDK resources for other drone platforms, as well as some of the data solution providers like <a href="https://www.airmap.com/">Airmap</a>, and other physical components providers like <a href="http://www.flir.com/home/">FLIR for imaging</a>, and <a href="https://www.lumecube.com/">LumeCube for lighting</a>. I am always having to pick my battles on how deep on want to go down each rabbit hole&nbsp;or stay at the high level for a wider perspective.</p>
<p>There is a lot going on here. I find drones fascinating from a technical perspective, and terrifying when it comes to surveillance, privacy, policing, and some of the other bad behavior we've seen recently. Like other areas of the tech space, I think APIs are important for not just managing devices and the experience, but also provide transparency, logging, auditing, and other <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/10/25/thinking-about-an-api-observability-stack/">observability considerations</a> when it comes to the Internet of Things space.</p>

<p>I get why people are interested in voice-enabled&nbsp;solutions like Alexa and Siri. I'm personally not a fan of speaking to get what I want, but I get the attraction for others. Similarly,&nbsp;I get why people are interested in bot enabled solutions like Facebook and Slack are bringing to the table, but I'm personally not a fan of the human-led noise in both of these channels, let alone automating this mayhem with bots.</p>
<p>In short, I'm not 100% on board that voice and bots will be as revolutionary as promised. I do think they will have a significant impact and are worthy of paying attention to, but when it comes to API driven conversational interfaces, I'm putting my money on push driven approaches to making API magic happen. Approaches like <a href="https://zapier.com/zapbook/push/">Push by Zapier</a>, and <a href="https://webtask.io/">Webtask.io</a>, where you can initiate a single, or chain of API driven events from the click on a button in the browser, in a web page, on my mobile phone, or hell, using the <a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2016/10/18/aws-iot-help-button/">Amazon Dash button approach</a>.</p>
<p>These web tasks operate in an asynchronous way, making them more conversational-esque. Allowing those of us who are anti-social, and have <a href="http://kinlane.com/2016/10/07/an-air-gap-between-me-and-the-online-world/">adequate air gapped our social and messaging channels</a>, and haven't fully subscribed to the surveillance economy, alternate solutions. These mediums could even facilitate a back and forth, passing machine readable values, until the desired result has been achieved. Some conversations could be predefined or saved, allowing me to trigger using a button at any point (ie. reorder that product from Amazon, retweet that article from last week). I'm not saying I don't want to have an API-enabled conversation, I'm just not sure I want a speaker or bot always present to get what I need to get done in my day.</p>
<p>I understand that I am not the norm. There are plenty of folks who have no problem with devices listening around their home or business, and are super excited when it comes to engaging with half-assed artificial intelligence wich accomplish basic tasks in our world(s). But I can't be that far out in left field. I'm thinking the landscape for conversational interfaces will be diverse, with some voice, some chat, and hopefully also some asynchronous approaches to having conversations that can be embedded&nbsp;anywhere across our virtual and physical worlds.</p>

<p>One of the things I love about my world as the API Evangelist is the time I get diving into rabbit holes and learning about different areas where technology is being applied. I do not always agree with the business motivations behind what is going on, which can result in some often pretty shady situations, but I enjoy stepping back and understanding the data, API and approaches behind what is going on.</p>
<p>I was doing some research on drone APIs recently, and as I was falling down the rabbit hole,&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.quandl.com/drone-data-for-investing">I found myself reading about drones being a source of alpha</a>? WTF is alpha? I had no idea and wanted to learn more about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_generation_platform">what an alpha generation platform</a> was, and how drones and APIs are playing a role--here is the definition I found:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>An alpha generation platform is a technology solution used in algorithmic trading to develop quantitative financial models, or trading strategies, that generate consistent alpha, or absolute returns. The process of alpha generation refers to generating excess returns.</em></p>
<p>The article that triggered this is about drones generating alpha was focused on the data generation, and communication capabilities of drones, and how they can be used in trading algorithms. Companies are looking to fly over crops, and predict yields, aggregate data, and add to the resources that available in the "alpha generation platform".</p>
<p>I'm not convinced of the reality of this approach, but it does provide for some interesting scenarios as I am learning about the data drones can gather, how this transfer occurs to the cloud, and be put to work using existing approaches to video, image, analysis, and visualization APIs. Also, it provides fuel for my alternate design fiction writing, where I explore the possibilities&nbsp;of technology, both good and bad.</p>
<p>From what I understand, this type of data would be considered "dirty" in the alpha workflow, in the same category of other data, you might gather from Amazon sales, Twitter sentiment, and other common API implementations. It's experimental, and not proven (yet) to produce the consistent or absolute returns I guess. What the article is discussing, are just early discussions, speculations, and desires of people looking to create a market--interesting fairy tales to tune into. Well, this is how markets operate right? On stories?</p>
<p>I'm adding high-frequency trading&nbsp;and alpha&nbsp;generation to my list of sectors potentially being impacted by drones. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/08/access-to-satellite-imagery-via-a-web-api/">Another area I'm diving into that intersects with this work are satellite APIs</a>. Satellite and drones intersect as drones are being used to fill in where satellite imagery can fall short (weather, low level buildings, etc.), but satellites are also being used as an alpha generation tool for high-frequency trading. I'm guessing drones and satellites are going to overlap with many other sectors like agriculture, mining, and the environment.</p>
<p>Lots of API and drone goodness to keep my mind busy.&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">25 Oct 2016</span>

<p>Internet-connected devices generate data. The most recent wave of mobile devices has opened up an unprecedented world of data generation and harvesting from the network, device, and application layers. The location data, photos, videos, and other valuable exhaust from these devices is why there has been so much investment in technology, and why we are seeing continued investment in the Internet of Things (IoT).</p>
<p>When it came to mobile phones this opportunity was new, and it isn't always clear that we are the product when it comes to making money off connecting these devices to the Internet. People aren't always aware of how much data they are generating, and how much this data is generating revenue for the latest generation of entrepreneurs--because it's new. Things have moved along, and it's not a secret anymore that devices connected to the Internet generating data has the potential to be very valuable in the right situation.</p>
<p>I have been historically frustrated with people's lack of awareness of this, but I'm hoping that with each wave of technology that comes in the future, we will get smarter about this, and stop being the product when we can, and begin demanding a piece of this action (if we do it at all). If our wearable fitness device is used in any healthcare study, if that weather, water, or pollution sensor in our yard is generating revenue, we should get a piece of the action. If a device in our homes or businesses is generating data, we should be a more aware of, and willing participant in this new supply chain.</p>
<p>The average person may not always care about their privacy&nbsp;in the surveillance economy, but maybe they'll care about lost opportunities for making money. At the consumer level this isn't always a coherent&nbsp;argument, but as you approach the work at home world, and into the professional territory, it can begin making more sense. Not all weather and pollution monitors might make sense for this, but when you start thinking about participating in clinical trials and operating your own drone fleet in farm country, revenue share models for Internet-connected devices might seem a little more realistic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Silicon Valley prefers an unaware, data-illiterate consumer, and even business class of users. I prefer a more aware, and data literate society, which is one reason I'm so big on APIs. Opening up 3rd party access, metering, and potentially revenue share opportunities for business, professionals, and individuals is one of the reasons I think APIs are important for all of this to work. I will keep studying how APIs are being used to generate, transmit, and generate revenue for platform providers, and device operators, so that I can hopefully keep pulling back the curtain on how the sausage is being made so that more of us can play in the game, and get a piece of the action.</p>

        <span class="post-date">25 Oct 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/datadog_observability_dashboard.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I am learning about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observability">observability</a> from reading Stripes <a href="https://stripe.com/blog/introducing-veneur-high-performance-and-global-aggregation-for-datadog">post on Veneur, a high performance and global aggregation for Datadog</a>. While the math of it all is over my head, the definition makes a lot of sense and provides me with a nice Venn&nbsp;diagram overlap across <a href="http://apievangelist.com">several areas of my API research</a>, including testing, monitoring, logging, analysis, and visualization.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observability">The Wikipedia definition for observability is</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Formally, a system is said to be observable if, for any possible sequence of state and control vectors, the current state can be determined in finite time using only the outputs (this definition is slanted towards the state space representation). Less formally, this means that from the system's outputs it is possible to determine the </em>behavior<em> of the entire system. If a system is not observable, this means the current values of some of its states cannot be determined through output sensors.</em></p>
<p>Stripe provides a great technical breakdown of the tools, services used to establish observability as part of their system operations, but I wanted to step back, and think about observability through a business and political lens. The business imperative for observability might seem clear, as you want as much visibility and awareness into your API operations as you possibly can, so you can provide a reliable level of service. I am thinking about the incentives for extending this observability beyond internal groups, to partners, developers, regulators, or the public--encouraging transparent observability.</p>
<p>This moves into <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/04/pushing-for-more-algorithmic-transparency-using-apis/">the area of API and algorithmic transparency you hear me ranting about regularly</a>, and t<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/10/14/transparency-in-police-access-to-social-platforms-using-oauth-and-apis/">he benefits APIs bring to the table when you apply in areas like policing and surveillance</a>, or other more regulated sectors of our society. When you take <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/10/07/regulatory-api-monitoring-for-validating-algorithmic-assertions/">the assertions applied as part of API testing and monitoring practices</a>, and you link them up to this observability stack definition, and open things up beyond just core technical groups, I think we are moving into new territory where we can begin to observe the real-time state of the systems that are increasingly making critical decisions in our lives.</p>
<p>I saw the potential for observability and awareness in the API layer back in 2010 with the <a href="http://logging.apievangelist.com">logging</a>, <a href="http://analysis.apievangelist.com/">analytics</a>, <a href="http://visualization.apievangelist.com/">visualizations</a> aspects of early <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/">API management</a> solutions like <a href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a>. In 2016, I'm thinking these benefits are going well beyond just the business of APIs, and can provide some of the critical transparency we are going to need to understand the behavior of increasingly complex corporate, institutional, and governmental systems, that in many cases we will have to be able to understand from the outside in using existing "output sensors".</p>
<p>In the future, we should be able to define any system as observable or not, when APIs are in play.</p>

</ul>
<p>As I curate the interesting news from across the API space each week I tag things to put them into different buckets. At the end of each week, I look through each bucket, deciding which area(s) I will be writing about each week. I am always trying to identify patterns and evolve the different areas of my research. One of the areas I'm considering adding as a formal area of API research is when it comes to certification.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been seeing the area come up quite a bit, making me think it is something I should be thinking more about, and researching&nbsp;as its own project. This week there were four items thought caught my attention:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://blog.bigml.com/2016/10/21/bigml-certifications-are-here/">BigML Certifications are Here!</a> - Professional certification on machine learning APIs, from a leading API provider.</li>
<li><a href="http://boingboing.net/2016/10/20/better-business-bureau-yanks-w.html">Better Business Bureau yanks Wells Fargo's accreditation</a> - &nbsp;Ok, not quite certification, but a classic representation and story to consider.</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.erratasec.com/2016/10/why-cybersecurity-certifications-suck.html">Why cybersecurity certifications suck</a> - A look into why certifications can be better, and applied in a critical area of the online world.</li>
<li><a href="https://eligible.com/blog/eligible-announces-soc2-certification/">Eligible Announces SOC2 Certification</a> - Certification than an insurance API provider on their availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, or privacy.</li>
</ul>
<p>These posts came after another four items from last week, providing, even more, to think about when it comes to APIs and certification:</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://boingboing.net/2016/10/13/a-new-certification-program-fo.html">A new certification program for Open Source Hardware</a> - I certify that I am truly open source, not that faux open source you see a lot of--we are the real deal!</li>
<li><a href="http://www.avnetwork.com/avnetwork/online-dante-certification-program-now-available/125135">Online Dante Certification Program Now Available</a> - Professional certification on audio APIs, from an older school software provider.</li>
<li><a href="https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2016/10/transform-your-business-become-a-Google-Certified-Professional-Data-Engineer.html">Transform your business; become a Google Certified Professional Data Engineer</a> - Professional certification that you know your stuff when it comes to data, specifically data in the Google ecosystem--data engineers are hot.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/ibm-launches-watson-application-developer-certification/">IBM launches Watson application developer certification</a> - Another professional certification for machine learning and artificial intelligence, this time from big blue.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a lot going on here when it comes to the concept of certification. I guess the BigML, Dante, and IBM certifications are more of what had in my head entering this post, but thinking about the shady shit that Wells Fargo has been up to, and thoughts on certifying that you are "ethical open source", or "honest open source" is fascinating to ponder as part of the big picture.</p>
<p>Another thing that stands out for me in these certification stories, is that there are two separate certifications for machine learning across the last two week. I can't help but think that there is some sort of purification going on in this ritual, or a sort of validation of the thing behind the certification, meaning that if you certify that professionals know this thing, then the thing, must be a thing. Right? IDK, I just can't help but think more of the motivations behind doing certifications, and the psychology behind how they are perceived (right or wrong)</p>
<p>I'm inches away from adding certification as an official API research area, so I can keep a closer eye on it. I've never been a big certification guy, but I understand why they exist, and why some people invest in them. If I add it as a research area, I'll dive in deeper to map out which API certifications exist out there, and which ones might provide a good model for other API providers to look at, or maybe even what to consider NOT doing when crafting your certification program.</p>

<p>I am seeing more people asking that we put on the brakes when it comes to technology, looking to slow the adoption of new technology, in favor of mastery of the existing, and getting our house in order with the technology we already in play. One of the core tenets of my message as the API Evangelist centers on the importance of doing what we are already doing&nbsp;and doing it better. <a href="https://www.govfresh.com/2014/01/next-us-government-api-strategy/">You can see this message present in my 2014 recommendation on an API strategy for the US federal government</a>--do more of what is already in motion, don't disrupt by just doing the new.</p>
<p>I have seen a lot of API technology float by in the last six years of doing API Evangelist. I can still get excited by some of it, but far less than I did in 2010 when I first started. This is partly because I'm tired, but mostly it is because I've seen a lot of shit float by, and it has to be meaningful in some way to get me excited. I am fairly willing to keep an open mind when it comes to microservices, DevOps, GraphQL, voice, bots, drones, and the other technological frontlines, but I refuse to accept that technology has to mindlessly march forward. This is more about selling us new things than it is every about truly bringing us real solutions to everyday problems.</p>
<p>Whether it's addressing technical debt and monoliths, the security concerns of the Internet of Things, or anything in between, we should always work to step back and ask if the new technology will actually provide a solution, or create three new problems for each solution it brings. I am not anti new tech, I love new shiny tech objects, but I think for our own sanity we should learn to be more thoughtful. New technology trends can be exciting, and fun to play with, but when it comes to production environments, and getting important things done, maybe it should stay in the R&amp;D lab or sandbox until it matures.</p>
<p>Maybe we can spend 2017 just taking care of what we already have in motion, and put a moratorium on any new and exciting projects until we get better at testing, usability, security, and other areas we seem to regularly suffer from in our operations. Maybe we can just do all those API implementations that we have the queue, over the next version of existing resources. IDK, if nothing else, maybe we can just a breather and allow us to play catch up a little, and ponders on what matters most.</p>

        <span class="post-date">25 Oct 2016</span>
        <p><a href="http://dns.apievangelist.com/patents/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/company/logos/uspto.png" alt="" width="25%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/01/27/my-stance-on-apis-and-patents/">I have been tracking on API related patents for some time</a>. I regularly pull XML dumps from the US Patent Office, a process in which I am getting more refined, so that I am able to easily tag, and organize them alongside the rest of my research. I spent some time this last week diving <a href="http://dns.apievangelist.com">into my DNS API research</a>, and after updating the rest of the data behind, I added <a href="http://dns.apievangelist.com/patents/">some DNS related patents</a>.</p>
<p>The patent information is already available in my API monitoring system, I just needed to be able to tag the patents, and write a script to publish the tagged patents&nbsp;to each of my Github projects. Now that I have this in place, it is pretty easy for me to spend an hour or two looking through the patents that come each week, and putting them into each area of the API space I study--which is why I have organized my API research the way that I have.</p>
<p>The patent information provides shines another light on each layer of the space for me. Understanding the companies, tools, and individual API endpoints provide me with important insight on what is going on, but the patents being submitted are an extremely important indicator of what is actually going on behind the curtain within industries, and companies. With this addition, my research is finally reaching the levels I originally envisioned when I first began organizing my work in this way, going beyond what is available on the "features" page for each company, organization, institution, or government agency is doing with APIs.</p>
<p>I can extract a lot of information from the product pages of the companies who are doing APIs, but these pages are designed to tell a specific story. I find that API definitions, press releases, and patent filings often tell a different story than the company's main product page. I would say that all these areas lie, but marketing, API definitions, press releases, and patent filings are all designed to tell specific untruths designed for different masters, and when you lay them side by side you begin to see a more complete picture of what is really going on in the API space.</p>

        <span class="post-date">24 Oct 2016</span>
        <p>I have blogged about this topic in the last 60 days, but I predict it is an area you will hear from me about regularly until I see it baked into more software solutions. <a href="http://cloudflare.com">CloudFlare, one of my favorite DNS API providers</a>&nbsp;has what I think is the best approach to linking to an API in the bottom corner of every UI element in their dashboard. If you look in the bottom right corner, next to the help icon you will see an API link.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/cloudflare_ui_api_1.png" alt="" width="75%" align="center" /></p>
<p>When I click on the API link I'm given the API path that corresponds to the UI element. In this scenario it allows me to purge the cache for my domain.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2016_10_23_at_11.14.58_pm.png" alt="" width="75%" align="center" /></p>
<p><a href="https://api.cloudflare.com/#zone-purge-all-files">I am also given a link to the full CloudFlare API documentation</a>. I have always been an advocate for companies making sure to have an "API" or "Developer" link in the footer of their main website. If you can make sure and have it front and center in the global navigation--all the better. Now I"m going to be advocating for an inline approach like CloudFlare. If all software as a service (SaaS) providers provided API transparency and access in this way, it would be a much different landscape.</p>
<p>The more people that know about APIs, the more people are putting them to work developing web and mobile applications, to assist us in moving our valuable bits and bytes around the cloud using iPaaS services like Zapier, and the increasing number of other applications APIs are being put to work in. When you make APIs accessible in this way, it transforms <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/10/11/ipaas-in-your-browser-with-push-by-zapier/">API solutions like Push by Zapier</a> into some pretty empowering solutions for helping the average business user put APIs to work, whenever and wherever they need.</p>
<p>Inline access to the API resources behind ALL UI elements is something I will be writing about regularly. Hopefully, I won't have to just keep talking about CloudFlare, and some other SaaS providers step up as well. If you are doing this, or know of a software provider that is as well, let me know so I can showcase here on the site.</p>

<p>I was pretty happy when my friend Arnaud Lauret&nbsp;(<a href="https://twitter.com/arno_di_loreto?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">@arno_di_loreto</a>) developed&nbsp;<a href="http://apistylebook.com/">API Stylebook</a>. I want to see his work expand and grow into someday containing hundreds or thousands of API design guides. To help contribute to his work I took the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/arno-di-loreto/apistylebook-api/blob/master/design/topics.yaml">YAML core of the design topics</a>&nbsp;he's aggregated and began developing <a href="https://api-evangelist-tools.github.io/api-design-guide/">an API design guide builder that runs 100% on </a><a href="https://api-evangelist-tools.github.io/api-design-guide/">Github</a>, allowing anyone to fork, and use to build their own API Stylebook on top of Arnaud's work.</p>
<p>Currently, I have two screens for API design guide builder:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://api-evangelist-tools.github.io/api-design-guide/edit/">Editor</a>&nbsp;- Allows for the editing of the YAML API Design Stylebook stored in the Github repository.</li>
<li><a href="https://api-evangelist-tools.github.io/api-design-guide/view/">View</a>&nbsp;- Allows you to view the API Design Stylebook stored in the Github repository.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm a big fan of this approach to developing little machine readable (YAML / JSON) micro tools that are simply HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a data core. In this scenario, Arnaud's design topics act's as the machine readable YAML core. I just developed the self-contained editor, and viewer, allowing anyone to fork and use to manage their own API design guide.</p>
<p>This is just a prototype. I am just getting started. I am looking to add autocomplete suggestions based on the other API design guides that Arnaud has aggregated in his API Stylebook. I am adding this, and some other features to the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist-tools/api-design-guide/issues">Github issues for the project</a>, if you have any feedback or suggestions feel free to submit an issue to the Github repository.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My objective here is to allow anyone to quickly fork, and build their own corporate or project API design guide, built on top of the existing best practices out there. I envision a future where every company, organization, institution, and an agency has their own API design guide, building on the best approaches available. Arnaud can continue to aggregate and merge the best practices (using Github) out there, and API providers can keep forking, and building on top of the best practices of the APIs they look up to across the landscape (another feature I want to add).</p>
<p>I really like what Arnaud has done with the&nbsp;<a href="http://apistylebook.com/">API Stylebook</a>. It reflects my own building block approach across <a href="http://apievangelist.com">my 70+ API research projects</a>, where I'm looking distil down what is happening&nbsp;across each stop along the API life cycle. I will be forking the API Stylebook design topics, and API design guides they have indexed, and adding to my own <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">API design research</a>. I am having fun building on top of his work&nbsp;and look forward to what other folks build on top of it as well.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2016/10/24/preserving-the-twitter-api-field-guide/">Preserving The Twitter API Field Guide</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">24 Oct 2016</span>
        <p>I'm a fan of the human elements of this technological shift that is going on in our world. We tend to focus on the technology, and the dudes who do the technologies (the cyber is HUGE), but what will really matter in 50 or 100 years will be the more human aspects of how we did all of this. Trust me, it is hard to make this boring ass API shit human in any way, so I am always excited when there are people&nbsp;who soften the hard edges of the gears as they grind forward.</p>
<p>One of the moments that has stood out for me in the last decade&nbsp;was the Twitter API Field Guide created by Taylor Singletary (<a href="https://twitter.com/episod">@episod</a>) during his time as an evangelist at Twitter. This field guide was removed by Twitter (not sure when as I just noticed today), but <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2012/field-guide-of-platform-objects">the original blog post remained</a>. Thank the Internet gods <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131017194923/https://dev.twitter.com/docs/platform-objects">for the Internet Archive (and Tyler pointing it out),</a> because a copy of his work still lives on for us all to enjoy.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2016_10_24_at_3.54.55_pm.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>I wanted to make sure a copy of it lives on beyond Twitter, and the Internet Archive, <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist/twitter-field-guide">so I copied (cleaned up) and published on Github (ha)</a>. While this work may seem out of date, and irrelevant, it is art and will be something we will look back on fondly in the future--it shouldn't simply be deleted. This is one of the problems with the constant change we have embraced in the tech space--many things we care about will just be deleted and lost forever.</p>
<p>For me, the Twitter Field Guide represents a specific time in the history of the web, and as I write this post I realize this was a dark time for API optimism in the Twitter API ecosystem, something that was having an effect on the wider API movement. I think this field guide was a very creative human response as we are struggling with not just the technical of the Twitter API, but the business and politics of operating an API platform at this scale. While it was just one iteration in the API documentation, it is like that vintage auto industry poster from 1930s&nbsp;and provides us with an important snapshot of this period in time, and should be preserved.</p>
<p>I understand that the documentation is out of date, which is probably why it was taken down, but this reflects what is wrong with technology as our master. It demands that we always march forward, with almost no consideration for human things that exist in the cracks. I do not expect tech companies to maintain everything old, but they should allow for archiving and preservation. <a href="http://twitter-field-guide.apievangelist.com/">I have copied and cleaned up a copy of the Twitter API Field Guide from the Internet Archive, and operating as a Github repository</a>. If you work at Twitter, please don't ask me to take this down--I'm not trying to disrespect the brand or platform, I'm just trying to keep your history alive. Plus I have copies, and I'll just keep putting back up. ;-)</p>
<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/04/12/the-api-purgatory-museum/">I have talked about the API purgatory museum before</a>, and if there are any API relics you'd like to see preserved feel free to drop me a line, and I'll see what I can do.

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2016/10/24/amazon-groups-should-share-more-api-design-patterns/">Amazon Groups Should Share More API Design Patterns</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">24 Oct 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/squirrelbin_arch.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>The sharing of common API design patterns is something we are really bad at in the API space. I'm not a believer that there is one API design pattern to rule them all, but I am a believer in learning from what works, consuming other people's APIs, and sharing design tips over the cubicle wall. I don't believe that everyone should be 100% REST-compliant in the crafting of their APIs, but you should be picking your head up from time to time, and learning from what the rest of the world is up to, especially across the other groups within your own company.</p>
<p>I tend to shy away on critiquing companies on API design, and prescribing any specific approach, but I can't help but point out inconsistencies in any approach, when it is clear that they aren't tuning into some of the common patterns out there, especially between their own internal groups. An example of this can be found at one of the API gods, Amazon Web Services. Amazon isn't known for their RESTful APIs, which is something I can overlook, but&nbsp;when it comes to their lack consistency between their different APIs, I think there are lessons for all of us to learn from.</p>
<p>I have not hacked against all of the Amazon APIs, but here are the four distinct patterns I've seen:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTBucketOps.html">S3</a>&nbsp;- </strong>/?{method}</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_Operations.html">EC2</a>&nbsp;- </strong>/?Action={method}</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_Operations_Amazon_Route_53.html">Route 53</a>&nbsp;-</strong> /2013-04-01/{methodname}</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_Operations_Amazon_Route_53_Domains.html"></a><a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_Operations_Amazon_Route_53_Domains.html">Route 53 Domains</a>&nbsp;-</strong>&nbsp;route53domains.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/ header: x-amz-target:Route53Domains_v20140515.{method}</li>
</ul>
<p>There might be additional patterns employed over at other Amazon APIs, but these are the four that I'm exposed to in my own integrations. The presence of two separate patterns within the Route 53 team was what prompted me to write this post. While I'm not a fan of the action={method} approach, which is the most common AWS pattern I have seen used, the passing of method as part of custom header just seems even wackier to me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not get dogmatic about specific API design patterns, but I do think that a lack of awareness of common patterns, especially across groups within the same company is counterproductive. I think Amazon has done amazing things as a pioneer in the space, forever changing how we deliver data, content, and algorithmic resources online, but I think they would benefit from a company-wide API design campaign. <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/tools/design-guides/">Something like Microsoft, Paypal, and others have done, to help standardize how they design APIs across all internal groups</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Oct 2016</span>
        <p>Amazon Web Service teams sure have been rocking their architectural icons across their storytelling lately. They standardized a set of icons for each of their cloud services and published in a variety of formats as the&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/icons/">AWS Simple Icons for Architecture Diagrams</a>. I am a big fan of the <a href="http://api.thenounproject.com/">Noun Project API</a> for use across my storytelling&nbsp;and find that having a standardized library of meaningful images and icons to be extremely valuable in helping quickly convey meaning (or entertain).</p>
<p>I was reading&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/optimizing-amazon-s3-for-high-concurrency-in-distributed-workloads/">optimizing Amazon S3 for high concurrency in distributed workloads from AWS</a>, and the diagram they provided, daisy chaining each of the AWS services at play, really brought the concept home for me. I read a lot, but I also scan a lot, and meaningful diagrams like this can go a long way to help me get up to speed as quickly as possible.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/parquetrename.png" alt="" width="75%" /></p>
<p>I have been <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/01/25/moving-towards-a-meaningful-set-of-icons-for-the-api-community/">an advocate for establishing icon sets for common API technologies, and even service providers</a>, and I think I will add individual API resources to the stack. It would be valuable to have icon sets for common API resources like images, video, storage, etc. Icons that spoke to what they did, but also clearly identifies them as an API resource&nbsp;and allowing them to possibly be daisy chained together like Amazon does.</p>
<p>API industry icons will have to wait until some benefactor steps up to invest in this crazy idea. I'm graphically challenged, I know what looks good, but I can't craft anything graphical to save my life--look at my logo. Even if we don't have an industry-wide set of icons, it might be something individual API providers would want to consider creating for their API resources, like Amazon does. It is something that could help make your storytelling more impactful, and provide a common set of icons for everyone to use when referencing specific API resources.</p>

<p>I've been thinking about the concept of a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/09/is-your-api-ready-for-wholesale/">wholesale API</a> for some time. Going beyond how we technically deploy our APIs, and focusing more on how we can provide a wholesale version of the same API resources, with accompanying terms of services that go beyond just a retail level of API access in the cloud. Not all APIs fit into this category of API, but with the containerization of everything, and the evolving world of Internet of Things (IoT), there are many new ways in which API resources are being deployed.</p>
<p>You can see this evolution in how we are deploying APIs present in one of the latest API deployment platforms I added to my <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">API deployment</a> research, <a href="http://www.nanoscale.io/platform/">Nanoscale.io</a>. This image is just a portion of their platform, but the separation of deployment concerns articulates the technical side of what I'm talking about, we just need to add in considerations for the business and political side of how this works.</p>
<p>We've seen API deployment move from on-premise and back again, and now we are seeing it move onto everyday objects like cameras, printers, routers, and other everyday objects. I'm watching service providers like Nanoscale.io emerge to help us deploy our APIs exactly where we need them. I'm guessing that the companies who have their business models in similar order, allowing for API service composition from the <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/">management layer</a> to further slide down the stack to the <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">deployment</a> layer, will come out ahead.</p>

If you are selling me API services you should have an API for all your services, especially one that allows me to discover&nbsp;and manage all the APIs I'm applying your service to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/12/07/minimum-viable-api-service-provider-blueprint/">expanding my definition of a minimum viable blueprint for API service providers</a>, and adding an API API as one of the default APIs. I'm going to be adding the account, billing, and a handful of other essential APIs to my default definition. If I'm using your service to manage any part of my API operations, I need to be automating discovery, management, and billing in our relationship.</p>
<p>It seems obvious to me but I'm looking to provide a simple checklist that other API service providers can consider as they craft their strategy. My goal is to help make sure each stop along the lifecycle can be orchestrated in a programmatic way like Tyk.</p>

        <span class="post-date">20 Oct 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-forward.png" alt="" width="30%" align="right" /></p>
<p>This is a&nbsp;topic that has come up in several discussions lately&nbsp;and is a topic I struggle with on a regular basis. What is more important, helping new users, both developer and non-developer be more aware of APIs, or is helping push forward the concept of APIs amongst those who are already tuned in? While I don't think there is a perfect answer, I think it is an important concept to explore and discuss.</p>
<p>I started API Evangelist on the premise of helping educate new users about the importance of APIs&nbsp;and is something I regularly strive to do, but if you read my blog I definitely do not always keep things simple and accessible&nbsp;to a wide audience. I keep coming back to this founding premise of API Evangelist&nbsp;and work hard to write about 101, and 201 level concepts, despite definitely being a card carrying member of the core API community.</p>
<p>There are a number of leading-edge topics in the space right now from hypermedia to GraphQL, as well as leading edge implementations like bot and voice enablement, but should we be careful to not focus too heavily on these leading issues, and make sure we all invest in new users education as well. I'm feeling like we should keep a core academic group focusing on the big issues, but also enlist armies of folks to help translate down the food chain.</p>
<p>I do not feel there is a right answer to this question. You ask me on separate days, I will answer differently. Sometimes the topics that push forward the API conversation seems most important, but then sometimes educating the developer masses, and the average business users about APIs seems like what will truly push forward the conversation. Even with my flip-flopping, which is why I will never run for president, I think this topic is something we should ask ourselves regularly, and try to understand where we stand as time marches forward.</p>

        <span class="post-date">20 Oct 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2016_10_19_at_4.41.44_pm.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>While it can be easy to bash on API providers for being tight with their API resources, it can be very difficult to be an API provider operating in today's online environment. Some developers are just badly behaved and hold some pretty unrealistic expectations when it comes to opening up access to valuable content, data, and algorithms.</p>
<p>This is why I work to be supportive of providers when locking down their API resources, as long as they do it a constructive way. One positive approach I came across recently was from <a href="https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com/signup">the Oxford Dictionaries API</a>, who ask a lot of questions as part of their API signup form, but I felt it was a positive experience, and provided no barriers to me gaining access to their valuable API resources.</p>
<p>They asked me details about what type of application I'm developing, as well as the platform and language I am employing--allowing me to provide a summary of what it was I would be doing. They provide me with a summary of the terms of service, and the ability to opt into a platform email list, and they also let me know that they will not be selling my personal details to third parties.</p>
<p>I have never been a fan of lengthy API signup forms, as I tend to feel like I'm just a lead in their sales funnel, but this left me feeling the opposite. The Oxford Dictionary API signup form felt more like it was about making sure everyone was informed&nbsp;and in the service of protecting valuable API assets. I'm a supporter of API providers requesting more details on what API developers are up to, as long as they do it in the right way. If you don't make me feel like I'm a criminal, that I'm just one of many users in your sales funnel, and that you are just looking to extract value from me, I'm more than happy to share more information about myself as I consider a deeper business relationship with you.</p>

        <span class="post-date">20 Oct 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2016_10_19_at_9.04.43_pm.png" alt="" width="20%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I enjoy learning from the OpenAPI Specs of the API providers I track on. Just having an OpenAPI Spec present tells a lot about an API provider in my book, but the level of detail some providers put into their API definitions adds another level to this for me. While reviewing <a href="https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com/swagger/spec/public_doc_guest.json">the OpenAPI Spec for the Oxford Dictionaries API</a>, I noticed their robust usage of the OpenAPI Spec parameters definitions collection, which provides an interesting overview of the surface area of the API, augmenting the benefits brought to the table by the definitions collection of an APIs underlying data schema.</p>
<p>When you are defining each path for an API you can either define the parameters using each paths parameters, or you can add them to the overall parameters definition object, allowing them to be reused across all paths. This object provided me with a centralized place to learn about the parameters used when making calls to the Oxford Dictionary API, and I'm assuming it helped them be more organized in how they defined the surface area of their APIs.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2016_10_19_at_9.04.05_pm.png" alt="" width="20%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I can see how the processing of defining each path's parameters, and centrally organizing them for reuse can be a healthy thing. The more you lift yourself out of the individual&nbsp;definition&nbsp;of each path&nbsp;and consider the parameter patterns that have been used for other paths, the chances you will have a better view of the landscape will increase. I am optimistic about this OpenAPI Spec object, and curious about how it can be evolved as part of other conversation around GraphQL--something I'll work to understand better in the future.</p>

<p>I keep an eye on <a href="https://github.com/trending?since=weekly">things that are trending daily and weekly on Github</a>&nbsp;because it is a great way to discover new companies and individuals doing interesting things with APIs. While looking at this earlier this week I came across <a href="https://github.com/open-guides/og-aws">the open guide to Amazon Web Services</a>, a pretty robust, and well organized&nbsp;getting started guide to everything AWS.</p>
<p>Here is their description of this resource out of the leading cloud computing platform:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>A lot of information on AWS is already written. Most people learn AWS by reading a blog or a &ldquo;<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html">getting started guide</a>&rdquo; and referring to the&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/">standard AWS references</a>. Nonetheless, trustworthy and practical information and recommendations aren&rsquo;t easy to come by. AWS&rsquo;s own documentation is a great but sprawling resource few have time to read fully, and it doesn&rsquo;t include anything but official facts, so omits experiences of engineers. The information in blogs or&nbsp;<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/amazon-web-services">Stack Overflow</a>&nbsp;is also not consistently up to date.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>This guide is by and for engineers who use AWS. It aims to be a useful, living reference that consolidates links, tips, gotchas, and best practices. It arose from </em>discussion<em> and editing over beers by&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/open-guides/og-aws/blob/master/AUTHORS.md">several engineers</a>&nbsp;who have used AWS extensively.</em></p>
<p>I find it interesting when API providers invest in authoritative&nbsp;solutions like this, acknowledging the scattered and often out of date nature of blogs, QA sites, forums, and the wealth of other self-service resources available for APIs. Amazon is getting seriously organized with their approach to provider resources for developers--they have been doing this a while, and know where the pain points are.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Amazon's organized approach, the breaking down by service, and the usage of Github are all interesting things I think are worth noting as part of my research. AWS is a tough API pioneer to showcase because they have way more resources than the average API provider, but as one of the early leaders in the API&nbsp;space they possess some serious&nbsp;wisdom&nbsp;and practices that are worth emulating. I'll keep going through <a href="https://github.com/open-guides/og-aws">their open guide</a>, and see what other patterns I can extract and showcase&nbsp;so that my&nbsp;readers can consider.</p>

<p>I am going through <a href="https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com">the Oxford Dictionaries API</a>, learning about this valuable resource. Their onboarding process for registration, and learning about what the API does using interactive documentation, is very smooth. One of the things that really cuts the rough edges off learning about each API are the enums that are available for each path.</p>
<p>The parameters required for making calls to many of the paths, like language and country, have their enum values populated as part of <a href="https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com/swagger/spec/public_doc_guest.json">their API definition</a>. I look at numerous OpenAPI Specs in the course of my work&nbsp;and they rarely have values present for enum, providing critical default values for developers to use--eliminating some often serious frustration.</p>
<p>Not having the right values available when making even the simplest of API calls can be a significant point of friction when trying to get up and running using an API. While it may seem like a small thing, the work the <a href="https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com">Oxford Dictionaries API</a> team has put into this level of detail for their API definitions will go a long way towards making their API resources more accessible and usable.</p>

<p>I have a number of folks at companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies come to me saying that they want to do APIs, and they need some help. In many of these discussions, the first task centers around addressing the motivations behind this declaration and helping folks realize they are already doing APIs, they are just not doing it in any sort of coherent and organized fashion.</p>
<p>Any business, organization, institution and government agency is moving machine readable data between internal, and with external systems in 2016, for use in a variety of applications. This is just done in a variety of often proprietary, ad-hoc, data dump, and other approaches that are often dictated without any coherent vision. API does not always mean 100% REST, it is about establishing interfaces between systems for programmatic usage across a variety of applications--the trick is to do all of this in a simplified, standardized, consistent, and low-cost way modeled on what has been working for the web.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are already doing API. You need to identify all the different ways you are already exporting, importing, migrating, syncing, and putting data to work across operations and begin to establish a coherent roadmap and approach to communicating about all of this. Then get to work identifying where the opportunities for standardizing how everything is defined, how&nbsp;access is needed, and a baseline for communication around these critical integrations on an ongoing basis. It's not about whether we should do APIs or not, you are already there, it is how do start doing it in a more organized and coherent way.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/20/d3js-visualizations-using-yaml-and-jekyll/">I have been playing around with different ways of using Google Spreadsheet to drive YAML and JSON data to Jekyll data projects hosted as Github repositories</a>. It is an approach <a href="http://government.services.adopta.agency/">I started playing around with in Washington DC, while I was helping data stewards publish government services as JSON-LD</a>. It is something I've been playing around with lately using to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/20/d3js-visualizations-using-yaml-and-jekyll/">drive D3.js visualizations</a>&nbsp;and even <a href="https://kinlane.github.io/teh-jigz-up/two/">a comic book</a>.</p>
<p>There are couple of things going on here. First, you are managing machine-readable data using Google Spreadsheets, and publishing this data as two separate machine readable formats: JSON and YAML. When these formats are combined with the data capabilities of a Jekyll website hosted on Github Pages, it opens up some pretty interesting possibilities for using data to fuel some pretty fun things. Plus...no backend needed.</p>
<p>To push this approach forward I wanted to apply&nbsp;to managing <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification">OpenAPI Specs</a> that can be used across the API life cycle. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dDrCFm8C2jtAkTm4zw86YJeREyCs9Vq49dAQeLiTxtg/pubhtml">I pulled together a spreadsheet template for managing the details I need for an OpenAPI Spec</a>. Then I created a Github repository, forked my previous spreadsheet to YAML project, and modified it to <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist-tools/openapi-spec-google-spreadsheet-to-jekyll-github-yaml">pull data from a couple of worksheets in the Google Doc&nbsp;and publish as both JSON and YAML OpenAPI Spec</a>s.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://api-evangelist-tools.github.io/openapi-spec-google-spreadsheet-to-jekyll-github-yaml/">My OpenAPI Spec Google Sheet to YAML for use in a Jekyll project hosted on Github is just a prototype</a>. The results don't always validate, and I'm playing with different ways to represent and manage the data in the Google Sheet. It is a fun start though! I am going to keep working on it, and probably start a similar project for managing an APIs.json&nbsp;index using Google Sheets. When done right it might provide another way that non-developers can participate in the API design process, and apply OpenAPI Specs to other stops along the API life cycle like with API documentation, SDK generation, or testing and monitoring.</p>

        <span class="post-date">19 Oct 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-flame.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>It is tough to keep a sustained fire burning in the world of technology, at the individual, organizational, and community level. I have been doing API Evangelist full time for six years, and it is no secret that I have had several moments where I've experienced a crisis of faith, and I do not doubt that there will be&nbsp;many more of these in my future--there is no perfect solution. It takes hard work, creativity, and a myriad of other considerations to keep going, stay energized, and keep other folks doing the same.</p>
<p>I have spent a great deal of time this fall thinking about all of the factors that influence me, and contribute to the fire burning, or acting as a flame retardant to me and the API space. When exploring these contributing factors, it is only logical we start with the external forces right? Because this all sucks because of everything external, aka all of you! Couldn't possibly be me?</p>
<p>So what are some of the external forces out there that contribute to the fire burning brightly, or possibly being dampened across API space are?</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>People Aren't Always Nice -</strong> For some reason, the Internet has brought the worst out in many of us. I personally feel this is the nature of technology -- it isn't human, and the more time you spend with it, the less human we are, and less empathy we will have for other people.</li>
<li><strong>Everyone Takes A Little -</strong> Until you've spent a great deal of time in the spotlight writing, speaking, or otherwise you don't fully grasp this one. Every person you talk to, every hand you shake, takes a little bit from you -- making it super critical for people to give back -- it all takes a toll, whether we acknowledge it or not.</li>
<li><strong>Few Ever Give Back -</strong> The general tone set by startup culture and VC investment is to take, take, take, and rarely give back. The number of people who want to pick your brain, take your open work, and not ever give anything in return is far greater than the people openly giving back, or acknowledging they should pay you for your time.</li>
<li><strong>Use &amp; Subscribe To Open Channels -</strong> Follow me on Twitter, and Medium. Subscribe to the Atom Feed and email newsletter. Support those people in the space who provide open channels of information by tuning in and engaging.</li>
<li><strong>Fork, Contribute &amp; Build Upon -</strong> When you fork someone's work plan on how you will contribute back, build upon, and cite their work. Don't just use open source, contribute back to it, and augment it with the value you bring to the table.</li>
<li><strong>Events Are Exhausting - </strong>Producing, organizing, and pulling of valuable events that focus on ideas over products are fucking hard, and you should support the open tech events you think contribute most to the tech space. Invest time, money, and your energy wherever you can afford it. I know your company demands you get the most out of your sponsorships, but step back and consider how you can give the most as part of your sponsorship as well.</li>
<li><strong>Where We Invest - </strong>95% of the investment in the APi space is into proprietary products, services, and technology. The other 10% is an equal investment in ideas, open concepts, specifications, definitions, and software. If companies do invest in "open" it is in name only, and not a true invest. Everyone suffers from this behavior, making the space pretty fucking business as usual--which is a fire that nobody wants to tend&nbsp;to for very long.</li>
<li><strong>Intellectual Property - </strong>Unhealthy views on IP lock up ideas. I'm not saying copyright, patents, and licensing shouldn't exist. I am saying that aggressive, greedy views will continue to act as a wet blanket when it comes APIs making a meaningful impact, and making the game pretty untenable for individuals.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>Next, up, what are some of the internal forces (aka my responsibility) that can contribute to the fire burning more brightly in the API space?</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Going To Burning Man -</strong> Yes burning man will reinvigorate you each year, but we have to find a way to establish a regular alter that we can burn on a regular basis, finding renewal on a regular basis without so much fucking dust involved.</li>
<li><strong>Eat Well -</strong> If we've learned anything over the last six years it is that man cannot live on pizza alone. Words of caution for you youngsters--eventually you will start falling apart, and this shit will break if you do not eat well.</li>
<li><strong>Alcohol -</strong> Drinking is fun&nbsp;and an important social lubricant, but it can also lead to some very bad behavior in real-time, as well as contributing to a multitude of other issues in life ranging from health to relationships.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Exercise -</strong> We just can't sit on our ass all the time, as much as we'd like to think we can. Again, this isn't a problem for the youngsters, but as we get on in life, it will catch up with you, and we are better off finding a way to work it in regularly.</li>
<li><strong>Family Time -</strong> Spending time with family is important. Too much travel, screen time and work all hurt this. Regularly check in on what is important when it comes to family. Even if it is just working on API integrations with your kids (did I tell you I'm doing a project with my daughter) -- woohoo!</li>
<li><strong>Creativity - </strong>Take time to invest in and move forward creative projects. All work and no play makes us all very fucking boring, and are not conducive to any flame burning. The less I invest in my creative side, the less productive I am in my regular work. As an individual and a business make sure there is the investment in creative projects and space.</li>
<li><strong>Money -</strong> Money is not everything, but making some is required. I've had several waves of $$ making good in my career, and it rarely ever brought me more happiness, and always brought me more concern. There is a lot of focus on VC investment, and showcasing the successful founders in the space. To keep a sustained fire burning we have to realize there is a lot more to all of this than just making money.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just some of the key external and internal forces contributing to the fire burning within me individually when it comes to APIs, and I also feel contribute the fire burning also across the community (which I am part of). Startup and VC investment success do not equal community and individual success. Rarely does a startup winning contribute to any single individual success, or the wider community being more vibrant, creative, and rich?&nbsp;You have a rare rock star founder, and always the wealth of corporate and brand success, but these do not make a fire burn brighter in the community. It might attract a few moths to the flame along the way but doesn't truly enrich everyone, and provide fuel for a sustained burn--it is about burning bright, fast, and hard, which aren't good for most of us humans.</p>
<p>I keep going as the API Evangelist because I'm interested in what I'm doing. I'm fulfilled by learning, writing, sharing, and building. I will keep going for another 10, 20, hopefully until the end of my life, because a real fire is truly burning--not because I met my sales goals, sold my startup, or reached API economy nirvana (that is API singularity). Most of the time I'm learning, I am being creative, and I've made more money than was required to pay my rent, my bills, and could eat well. More meetings. More projects. More handshakes. More money does not always nurture me, and keep the fire alive personally, or within the wider API community.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/twitter_logo_blue.png" alt="" width="25%" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="http://branding.apievangelist.com/">API branding</a> is an area that I find to be contradictory in the space, with the loss of brand control being in the top concerns for companies when doing APIs, while simultaneously one of the most deficient areas of API operations, with most API providers have no branding guidance in their developer portal whatsoever. I think it is just one of those telling aspects of how dysfunctional many companies are, and how their concerns are out of alignment with reality, and where they are investing their resources.</p>
<p>Every API should have some sort of branding page or area for their API operations--<a href="http://apievangelist.com/branding-guidelines/">I even have a branding page</a>. ;-) If you are looking for a healthy example to consider as a baseline of your branding page, <a href="https://brand.twitter.com/">take a look at Twitters branding page</a>, which provides the essential building blocks you should be considering:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Simple URL </strong>- Something easy to find, easily indexed by search engines, even a subdomain like Twitter does.</li>
<li><strong>Logos &amp; Assets -</strong> Provide us with at least a logo for your company, if not a wealth of assets&nbsp;to put to use.</li>
<li><strong>Branding Guidelines -</strong> Offer up some structure, helping guide us, and show you've put some thought into branding.</li>
<li><strong>Link to Embeddables -</strong> If you have any buttons, badges, and widgets, point us to your embeddable resources.</li>
<li><strong>Link to Terms of Service -</strong> Provide us with a quick link to the terms of service as it applies to branding.</li>
<li><strong>Contact Information -</strong> Give me an email, or another channel for asking a question if I get confused at any time.</li>
</ul>
<p>I do not agree with all of Twitter's branding enforcement, but I respect that they have set a bar, and provide the ecosystem with guidance. At the very least, it makes sure all of us are using the latest logo, and when done right it can help encourage consistency across every integration that is putting API resources to work. I find it hard time respecting branding concerns from companies who don't have a dedicated branding resource area for me to consult.</p>
<p>When done right, APIs extend the reach of any brand. Think about Twitter and Facebook sharing, and other embeddables. Most API consumers are more than happy to help extend your brand, but we are going to be lazy, and ALWAYS need guidance&nbsp;and things to copy / paste. At the very least, make sure you have the minimum viable branding assets and guidance like Twitter does, it really is the minimum bar for any API operating out there, and should not be ignored.</p>

<p>I am working on a project with a 16-year-old young lady to extract and tell a story using the <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/">YouTube API</a>. I'm pretty excited about the project because the young lady happens to be my daughter Kaia Lane. If you've ever seen my API Blah Blah Blah t-shirt, you've seen her work. Historically she could care less about APIs, until recently when pulling data about one of her favorite YouTube stars came up--suddenly she is interested in learning more about APIs.</p>
<p>During regular chatting with my daughter, I shared a story <a href="http://polygraph.cool/kickstarter/">on&nbsp;the entire history of Kickstarter projects broken down by a city</a>. She is a little geeky and likes Kickstarter, so I figured I'd share the approach to telling stories with data, and said that if she ever wanted help telling a story like this using YouTube, Instagram, or another platform, that she should let me know. She came back to me a couple days later asking to learn more about how she could tell a story like this using data pulled from one of the YouTube stars she follows. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Ok. I have to stop there for a moment. My 16-year-old daughter&nbsp;just asked me to learn more about APIs. :-) As an old goofy dad who happens to be the API Evangelist, I am beside myself.</p>
<p>I'm not 100% sure where this project will go. Right now I'm just seeing what data I can pull on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/DanAndPhilGAMES">Dan &amp; Phil's video game YouTube channel</a>, and from there we'll talk more about what type of story we want to tell about their followers&nbsp;and get to work pulling and organizing the data we need. I couldn't think of a tougher audience to be trying to get her interested in APIs. She isn't going to care about APIs, wants to learn about APIs, let alone become proficient with APIs unless they are relevant and interesting to her world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not think this lesson is exclusive to teaching 16-year-olds about API. I think this applies to ANYONE potentially learning about APIs. I am a big fan of EVERONE learning about APIs because they are the plumbing that moves our bits and bytes around in our personal and professional worlds. The more we are aware and the more we know we can put APIs to work, the more successful we are going to be in our lives. I want EVERYONE to open up and learn about APIs for this reason, but I REALLY REALLY want my daughter to find success in this way.</p>
<p>Just something to consider, as we are trying to help key internal, essential partner and other public stakeholders understand the API potential. How can we present APIs in a way that is relevant and interesting? Otherwise, most people probably aren't going to care, and it will all just be API Blah Blah Blah!</p>

<p>I was reading <a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/document-description-formats-web-apis">a virtual panel: document and description formats for web APIs</a>,&nbsp;and thought the conversation was very productive when it comes to helping bring the world of API documentation and definitions into better focus. I encounter daily reminders that folks do not see the many dimensions of API definitions, and the role they play in almost every stop along the life cycle. This virtual panel helps move this discussion forward for me, providing some clarification for when it comes to the separation between API definitions and API documentation.</p>
<p>One of the questions asked of the panels was "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Do you see API Documentation and Description formats as a single thing? Or multiple things?"</span> Which I found&nbsp;Zdenek Nemec (<a href="https://twitter.com/zdne">@zdne</a>) answer to be a great introduction for folks when it comes to understanding the importance of this separation:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>There are definitely two different things. But truth be told, the initial incentive for the use API description formats was definitely the vision of API documentation without much work. However, the tide is turning as more and more people are discovering the benefits of the upfront design, API contracts, and quick prototyping</em></p>
<p>Many people still see machine readable definitions as purely something that drives API documentation. OpenAPI Specs are just for deploying Swagger UI, and API Blueprint is just for using Apiary. When in reality, the why and how you are doing API definitions is much, much deeper. As Z from Apiary points out, it is key to the API design and prototyping process, and critical to establishing the API contract.</p>
<p>Realizing that crafting machine readable API definitions is not just about API documentation, and that it is essential to establishing a meaningful technical, business, and legal contract internally, with partners, and maybe the public, early on in this API life cycle is empowering. I would say that I didn't fully appreciate API design, and understanding the depth of it until I had OpenSpec providing me with a scaffolding to hang things on.</p>
<p>Anyways, <a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/document-description-formats-web-apis">it is a great conversation from some very smart folks over at InfoQ</a>, I recommend heading over and spending time absorbing it. I'm leaving open for a week and rereading until it all sinks in.</p>

<p>I look at a lot of websites for companies who are providing APIs and selling services to the API space. When I find a new company, I can spend upwards of 10 minutes looking for all the relevant information I need to connect. Elements like where their Twitter and Github accounts are. These are all the key channels I am looking for so that I can better understand what a company does and stay in tune with any activity, but they are also the same channels that developers will be looking for so that they can stay in tune a platform as well.</p>
<p>I spend a great deal of time looking for these channels, so I'm always happy when I find companies who provide a near complete set of icons for all the channels that matter. <a href="https://restlet.com/">Restlet, the API design, deployment, management,and&nbsp;testing&nbsp;platform</a>&nbsp;has a nice example of this in action, providing the following channels:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facebook</li>
<li>Twitter</li>
<li>Google+</li>
<li>LinkedIn</li>
<li>Vimeo</li>
<li>Slideshare</li>
<li>Github</li>
<li>Stack Overflow</li>
<li>Email</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these channels are available as orderly icons in the footer of their site. Making my job easier, and I'm sure making it easier for other would be API developers. They also provide an email newsletter signup along with the set of icons. While this provides me with a nice set of channels to tune into, more than I usually find, I would still like to have a blog and atom feed icons, as well as maybe an AngelList or Crunchbase, so that i can peak behind the business curtain a little.</p>
<p>I know. I know. I am demanding, and never happy. I am just trying to provide an easy checklist for companies looking to do interesting things APIs of the common channels they should consider offering. You should only offer up channels that you can keep active, but I recommend that you think about offering up as many of these as you possibly can manage. No matter which ones you choose, make sure you organize them all together, in the header and footer of your website, so nobody has to go looking for them.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-contract.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>One of the reasons I write so much on API Evangelist is to refine how I tell stories about APIs and hopefully make a bigger impact by being more precise in what I'm saying. I feel like one of the reasons <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/10/12/we-understimated-the-time-it-would-take-for-hypermedia-to-be-absorbed/">why hypermedia API concepts have to take longer than we anticipated to spread</a> is because many (not all) of the hypermedia elite suck at telling stories. I am sorry, but you have done a shit job selling the importance of hypermedia, and often times were just confrontational and turning many folks off to the subject.</p>
<p>I am working on playing around with telling different stories about hypermedia, hoping to soften some of the sharp edges of the hypermedia stories we tell. One of the core elements of hypermedia APIs is they provide us with links as part of each API response, emulating much of what works with the web, in the system to system, and application layers of the web. One of the benefits of these links is they help facilitate&nbsp;the evolution and change that is inevitable in our API infrastructure.</p>
<p>The default argument&nbsp;for hypermedia folk is often about versioning&nbsp;and change-resistant API clients. I'm looking to help make these concepts more human, and that employing hypermedia&nbsp;as part of our API contracts is more about providing an honest and flexible view of the business relationship we are entering into. As API provider and consumer, we are acknowledging that there will be change and evolution in the resources that are being delivered, and being more honest that this exists, as we craft this API contract.</p>
<p>As an API provider I am not just going to dump this JSON product response on you, and expect you to know what to do, refusing to have a discussion with my consumers that this product will change. it might be out of inventory, and might be replaced by another product, and any number of evolution changes that may occur in the normal course of business. Hypermedia gives me a framework to acknowledge that this will indeed evolve upon entering our agreed&nbsp;upon API contract, and provide a channel for all integrated API clients to receive future instructions about what is possible when things do change--our API contract is flexible.</p>
<p>As an API provider, when I share this machine-readable representation of my product I'm not just assuming you know you can add it to the cart, or to a wish list, I am providing you with the links to do this, and the link relations that define this relationship. As things change and evolve, I have a way to share other opportunities, and changes to this business contract. When a product is recalled, there is a link routing you to what you need. When a product is replaced, you are routed to what you need. As an API provider, I'm committed to providing you with what you need to be successful when putting API resources to work.</p>
<p>Hypermedia goes being just providing links, managing versioning, and ensuring more resilient API clients--a very technical story. Hypermedia gives us a more honest and flexible way to define the API business contracts we are entering into when we make API resources available internally, with partners, and even with the public at large. Change is inevitable, and I feel like we need to be more honest about this change and be less rigid in how we are doing things, and I keep coming back to hypermedia as a meaningful way we can make this happen.</p>

        <span class="post-date">17 Oct 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-conversational-interfaces.png" alt="" width="30%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I am spending a lot of time thinking about conversational interfaces, and how APIs are driving the voice and bot layers of the space. While I am probably not as excited about Siri, Alexa and the waves of Slack bots being developed as everyone else, I am interested in the potential when it comes to some of the technology and business approaches behind them.</p>
<p>When it comes to these "conversational interfaces", I think voice can be interesting, but not always practical for actually interacting with everyday systems--I just can't be talking to devices to get what I need done&nbsp;each day, but maybe that is just me. I'm also not very excited about the busy, chatty bots in my Slack channels, as I'm having trouble even dealing with all the humans in there, but then again maybe this is just me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am interested in the interaction between these conversational interfaces and the growing number of API resources I track on, and how the voice and bot applications which are done thoughtfully, might be able to do some interesting things&nbsp;and enable some healthy interactions. I am also interested in how webhooks, iPaaS, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/10/11/ipaas-in-your-browser-with-push-by-zapier/">push approaches like we are seeing out of Zapier</a>, can influence the conversation around conversational interfaces.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conceptually I can be optimistic about voice enablement, but I work in the living room across from my girlfriend, I'm just not going to be talking a lot to Siri, Alexa or anyone else...sorry. Even if I move back to our home office, I'm really not going to be having a conversation with Siri or Alex to get my work done, but then again maybe its just me. I'm also really aware of the damaging effects of too much messaging, chat, and push notification channels open, so the bot thing just doesn't really work for me, but then again maybe it's me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am more of a fan of asynchronous conversations than I am of the synchronous variety, which I guess could be more about saved conversations, crafted phrases or statements that run as events triggered by different signals, or even by me when I need via my browser--like Push by Zapier does. I see these as conversations, that enable single or a series of API enabled events to occur. This feels more like orchestration, or scripted theater which accomplishes more of what I'm looking to do&nbsp;than synchronous conversations would accomplish for me.</p>
<p>Anyways, just some exercising of my brain when it comes to conversational interfaces. I know that I'm not the model user that voice and bot enablement will be targeting with their services, but I can't be all that out in left field (maybe I am). Do we really want to have conversations with our devices or the imaginary elves that live on the Internet in our Slacks and Facebook chats? Maybe for some things? What I'd really like to see is a number of different theaters where I can script and orchestrate one time, and recurring conversations with the systems and services I depend on daily, with the occasional synchronous engagement required with myself or other humans, when it is required.</p>

<p>With a lot of my storytelling, I feel like captain obvious, but I also recognize the importance of simple, and sometimes repetitive storytelling to help reach my audience of time and resource-strapped&nbsp;API providers. Sometimes API providers are just too busy to remember the small things, and this is where I come in to help you remember some of the most obvious aspects of providing APIs that can be essential to success.</p>
<p>This morning's reminder is that nobody will know the cool things your API does if you do not showcase what is being done with it. This is why I added my <a href="http://showcase.apievangelist.com/">API showcase research</a>, to highlight the approach of the successful API providers, and give me a regular reminder to write about the topic. I understand you are busy, but so are your API consumers, and there is a good chance they need a little help understanding what can be done with your super valuable API resource(s).</p>
<p>Showcasing your successful API integrations is where the rubber meets the road with API operations. Tell us all about the cool things people are doing with your APIs. It doesn't have to be a full blown&nbsp;case study (although that would be nice too), it can be 250 words, plus some bullets, and another 250 words, helping us understand the possibilities in 2 minutes or less. From my experience in the space, people eat up these simple, easy to read examples of APIs solving problems, and providing solutions.</p>
<p>Ideally, you are showcasing the cool things being done with your API on a regular basis via your blog, but if for some reason, you are too busy, make sure and at least share your thoughts with me via email. You never know, if it is worthy, I might take the time to share here on API Evangelist.</p>

<p>I tune into a number of different channels looking for signs of individuals, companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies doing APIs. I find APIs using Google Alerts, monitoring Twitter and Github, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/14/harvesting-companies-who-are-doing-apis-from-press-releases/">using press releases</a> and&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/02/api-patent-search-as-way-to-discover-companies-who-are-doing-apis/">via patent filings</a>. Another way I am learning to discover APIs is via alerts and notifications about security events.</p>
<p>An example of this can be found via the <a href="https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/">Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team out of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/icscert">@icscert</a>), with the recent issued advisory <a href="https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSA-16-287-01">ICSA-16-287-01 OSIsoft PI Web API 2015 R2 Service Acct Permissions Vuln to ICS-CERT website</a>, leading me to <a href="https://techsupport.osisoft.com/Products/Developer-Technologies/PI-Web-API/Overview">the OSIsoft website</a>. They aren't very forthcoming with their API operations, but this is something I am used to, and in my experience, companies who aren't very public with their operations tend to also cultivate an environment where security issue go unnoticed.</p>
<p>I am looking to aggregate API related security events and vulnerabilities like the feed coming out of Homeland Security. This information needs to be shared more often, opening up further discussion around API security issues, and even possibly&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/10/11/expanding-on-the-3rd-party-analysis-of-security-threats/">providing an API for sharing real-time updates and news</a>. I wish more companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies would be more public with their API operations&nbsp;and be more honest about the dangers of providing access to data, content, and algorithms via HTTP, but until this is the norm, I'll continue using API related security alerts and notifications to find new APIs operating online.</p>

I am a huge fan of what interactive documentation like Swagger UI, and Apiary brought to the table, but I'm an even bigger fan of the creative ways people are evolving&nbsp;upon the concept, making learning about APIs a hands-on, interactive experience wherever possible.</p>
<p>To kick off my education of the YouTube API I started playing with <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/search/list">the search endpoint for the Youtube Data API</a>. As I was playing with I noticed the had an API explorer allowing me to call the search method and see the live data.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2016_10_16_at_2.35.09_pm.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>Once I clicked on the "Authorize requests using OAuth 2.0" slider I got a popup that gave me options for selecting OAuth 2.0s copes, that would be applied by the API explorer when I make API calls.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2016_10_16_at_2.34.01_pm.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>The inline OAuth is simple, intuitive, and what I needed to define my API consumption, in line within the Youtube API documentation. I didn't have to write any code&nbsp;or jump through a bunch of classic OAuth hoops. It gves me what I need for OAuth, right in the documentation--simple OAuth is something you don't see very often.</p>
<p>I'm a supporter of more API documentation being an attractive static HTML layout like this, with little interactive modules embedded throughout the API docs. I'm also interested in seeing more web literacy being thrown in at this layer as well, <a href="http://webconcepts.info/">pulling common web concepts and specification details</a>, and providing popups, tooltips, and other inline API design learning opportunities.</p>
<p>I'm adding YouTube's approach to OAuth to my list of approaches to a modular approach to delivering interactive API documentation, for use in future storytelling.</p>

<p>Someone turned me on to <a href="https://github.com/mermade/widdershins">an OpenAPI Spec to Slate / Shins compatible markdown converter on Github</a> this last week. I have been an advocate for <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2015/06/25/we-should-be-generating-slate-from-swagger-so-we-maintain-a-machine-readable-core/">making sure we are still using machine readable API definitions for our API documentation, even if we are deploying the more attractive Slate</a>. I've been encouraging folks to develop an attractive option for API documentation driven by OpenAPI Spec for some time, so I am happy to add this converter to my <a href="http://documentation.apievangelist.com">API documentation research and toolbox</a>.</p>
<p>The OpenAPI Spec to markdown converter also introduced me to <a href="https://github.com/mermade/shins">a version of Slate that is ported to JavaScript / Node.js called Shins</a>. I'm going to add Shins to my API documentation research, and "widdershins" the OpenAPI Spec to markdown converter to my <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">API definition research</a>. The auto-generation of attractive API documentation like Slate and Shins seems like a valid approach to getting things done, and worth including in my research.</p>
<p>I am increasingly publishing&nbsp;<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/api-evangelist/monitoring/gh-pages/_data/api-commons/runscope/account-api-openapi-spec.yaml">YAML editions of my OpenAPI Specs</a> which drive <a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com/apis/">API documentation that operates on Jekyll, using Liquid</a>. So I am all about having many different ways to skin the API documentation beast, allowing it to be easily deployed as part of any CI flow, and enabling the publishing of API docs for many different APIs, in many different developer portals or embedded on any device as part of IoT deployments. I think that a diverse range of approaches are optimal, as long as we do not lose our machine readable core.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Oct 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/facebook_instagram_and_twitter_provided_data_access_for_a_surveillance_product_marketed_to_target_activists_of_color__american_civil_liberties_union.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.aclu.org/blog/free-future/facebook-instagram-and-twitter-provided-data-access-surveillance-product-marketed">I was learning about&nbsp;Geofeedia providing law enforcement access to social media data from Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram via their API(s) this week</a>. Geofeedia was making money by selling surveillance services to law enforcement build on top of these social APIs and is something that I guess Facebook and Instagram have cut-off access, but they could still have Twitter access through a reseller (Gnip?).&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>This isn't something that will just go away. If law enforcement wants access to user's data on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, they are going to get it. I am guessing that the rules regarding what law enforcement can or can't do aren't clear (I will have to learn more), and something that is just left up to platforms to enforce via their terms of service. It is a problem that modern approaches to API authentication, management, and analytics are well designed to help make sense of--we just have to come up with a new layer defined specifically for law enforcement.</span></p>
<p><span>Law enforcement should be able to fire up any standard, or customized solution they desire to search against social media data via APIs. However, they should be required to obtain an application key, and obtain the OAuth tokens that any other developer would need to. Rather than law enforcement being the customer of companies like Geofeedia, they should each get their own app id and keys, providing an identifying&nbsp;application that represents a specific law enforcement agency. They can still buy the software from providers, they just need the unique identifier when it comes to API consumption.</span></p>
<p><span>Along with this access, we also need to begin to define an auditable or regulatory layer, where other government agencies or 3rd party auditors can get access to the access logs for all applications registered to law enforcement&nbsp;agencies. A kind of real time FOIA access to the API management layer, allowing for a window into how law enforcement agencies are searching and putting social media data to use.</span></p>
<p><span>Of course, there will be special considerations regarding the OAuth interactions at play. At what point are end-users notified that their data is being accessed by law enforcement, and at what point do other government agencies and 3rd party auditors have access to API access to log file APIs for the law enforcement applications that are consuming Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and other APIs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>There is a lot of work ahead to define how law enforcement can put social data to work via APIs, but the tools are there. Modern API infrastructure excels at this when done right. We can give law enforcement access to the data they need, while also enabling transparency in the process, making the platform operators like Twitter and Facebook feel better, while also respecting the privacy of US citizens. We need to just hammer out the OAuth scopes for these relationships similar to how we do it for <a href="http://partners.apievangelist.com/2014/05/14/the-future-of-public-private-sector-partnerships-being-negotiated-at-the-api-oauth-scope-level/">energy</a>, <a href="http://openid.bitbucket.org/HEART/openid-heart-fhir-oauth2.html">healthcare</a>, and other vital data being served up via APIs.</p>
<p><span>This is a problem that will keep popping up. We can't just rely on groups like ACLU to find the companies who are acting as brokers&nbsp;and waiting for the platforms to play whack a mole when these companies are singled out. We need a formal definition to guide how law enforcement&nbsp;is obtaining access to increasingly vital social media and network data via APIs. We need some transparency and consistency in the process, something that APIs do well when executed properly.</span></p>
<p><span>While it makes cringe think about. I predict that many companies will be required to have API access in the future--specifically for this purpose. My hope is that there is also some transparency and consistency baked into this approach, leverage what web APIs do best. Allowing law enforcement to get what they legally need, allowing other government agencies, watchdog groups, and journalist to get self-service, predefined access to understanding what law enforcement is up to when it comes to surveillance using online services.</span></p>
<p><span>I will spend more time on this subject. Mapping out how it might work across the top platform like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. I'm hoping that we can make some movement in this area before too many other episodes occur.</span></p>

<p>While spending some time going through my <a href="http://monitoring.apievangelist.com/">API monitoring research</a> I found myself creating <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/api-evangelist/monitoring/gh-pages/_data/api-commons/datadog/apis.yaml">an OpenAPI spec and APIs.json&nbsp;index for the DataDog API</a>, and had the realization that this is the beginning of what I'm looking for when <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/23/who-is-going-to-do-the-devops-aggregation-api-platform/">I was talking about a DevOps aggregation API platform</a>. DataDog is just the monitoring layer of this vision I have, but it has many of the other elements I'm looking for.</p>
<p><a href="http://docs.datadoghq.com/api/">DataDog has all the monitoring elements present in their API platform</a>, and they have <a href="http://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/">all the platform integrations I'm envisioning in a DevOps aggregate API</a>. We just need the same thing for <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">design</a>, <a href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com">deployment</a>, <a href="http://virtualization.apievangelist.com">virtualization</a>, <a href="http://serverless.apievangelist.com">serverless</a>, <a href="http://dns.apievangelist.com">DNS</a>, <a href="http://sdk.apievangelist.com">SDK</a>, <a href="http://documentation.apievangelist.com">documentation</a>, and the other <a href="http://apievangelist.com">critical stops along a modern API life cycle</a>.</p>
<p>I'll keep profiling the APIs for the service providers in my life cycle research&nbsp;until I get more of this DevOps aggregate API definition mapped out. Hopefully, I will stumble across other providers like DataDog who are doing such an interesting job with the choreography, and orchestration that will be needed to work across so many platforms. I appreciate API aggregation service providers who 1) have an API, and 2) share so much of the definition behind their work.</p>
<p>The next thing I will work on is profiling the metrics that DataDog has defined across the platforms they integrate with. <a href="http://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/awskinesis/">Take a look at the metrics they have defined for each integration</a>, there are some valuable patterns available in their work. I'd love to see a common set of API monitoring metrics emerge from across providers, something that if we standardize and share in a machine readable way, others will emulate--making&nbsp;interoperability much smoother when it comes to monitoring.</p>
<p>I just wanted to keep beating my drum about the fact that APIs aren't just about building applications, they are also critical to the API life cycle, and making sure there are stable, scalable APIs to build applications on top of in the first place.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Oct 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/twitter_developers.png" alt="" width="30%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I am working on profiling <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/">the Twitter API</a> again, and I thought their stack of APIs have evolved significantly beyond what we tend to think of as the Twitter API, and was worth taking another look at. It is easy to think of Twitter API being about tweeting, friends, and following people, and #hashtags, but they have an interesting mix that I think tells its own story about Twitter's journey.</p>
<p>Here is the current Twitter API stack:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public">Public REST API</a></strong> - The public REST APIs provide programmatic access to read and write the Twitter data -- what we think of when we talk about the Twitter API.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/media">Media API</a></strong> - The APi for managing photo, videos or animated GIFs, that are used by other Twitter API endpoints when tweeting, direct messaging, and others.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/collections">Collections API</a></strong> - The API for managing collections of tweets to tell specific stories, providing a single URL that represents each Twitter collection.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/ton">The TON (Twitter Object Nest) API</a></strong> - Allowing implementers to upload media and various assets to Twitter, allowing for resumable, and single file uploads.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/curator">Curator API</a></strong> - Provides broadcasters their curator-created streams for on-air graphics systems, or other digital displays.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/overview">Streaming APIs</a></strong> - Deliver new responses to REST API queries over a long-lived HTTP connection, providing a regular stream of tweets from the platform.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://dev.twitter.com/ads/overview">Ads API </a></strong>- The Ads API gives partners a way to integrate Twitter advertising management in their product. Selected partners have the ability create their own tools to manage Twitter Ad campaigns while easily integrating into existing, cross-channel advertising management solutions.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.gnip.com/">Gnip</a></strong> -&nbsp;<span>Gnip is Twitter&rsquo;s enterprise API platform, delivering real-time and historical Twitter firehose data for large use applications.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>It is interesting to think about Twitter's long API evolution that got them here. I hear people often reference Twitter as the most extreme example of a public API out there. Granted, it is definitely the original example and has a very public element to it, but it also has several APIs that require partner status&nbsp;or special permissions to access, with the documentation available publicly--pushing back on the Twitter stereotype often used when we discuss APIs.</p>
<p>While most API providers will never reach Twitter scale, I think there are lessons in growth present here. That you don't always have to be 100% public, that you'll probably need streaming and higher volume solutions, including sensible handling of heavy media objects like images and video, as well as make money--do not forget to make money. It makes me sad that monetization on the Twitter platform is all about advertising, a huge missed opportunity for them in my opinion, but the advertising API is still worth documenting alongside the others.</p>
<p>Ok, that concludes my fresh look at the Twitter API stack. I'm going through each of them and documenting all available endpoints&nbsp;while profiling their current approach to the business of API operations. I figured that I better document everything before they get purchased by someone for Christmas. I haven't heard back on my offer yet, so I' guessing I was outbid. ;-)</p>

<p id="24c2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was reading the <a href="https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/hard-questions-about-bot-ethics-4f80797e34f0#.6615uvn7q">hard questions on bot ethics from Slack</a>, and their thoughts on bot advertising grabbed my attention. Trying to understand how bots will be monetizing things has been something I'm learning about, so I found Slack's post rather timely, and relevant to this fast growing layer of the API world.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Here was Slack's view on advertising with bots by developers:</p>
<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>A bot should not serve ads unless it has a strong, expressed purpose that benefits the user in doing so, and even then only on B2C platforms. I would hate to see bots becoming the new tracking pixel. Bots should not be prompting users to click on things and buy things unless explicitly asked to do so.</em></p>
<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They continue by adding that, <em>"ads in apps are against the&nbsp;<a href="https://api.slack.com/">Slack API</a>&nbsp;terms of service, and that makes me rather proud"</em>. I'm hoping that the Slack's business model is solid enough that they'll never need to consider bot advertising. I think it is an interesting constraint upon the community, and one that I'm curious how they'll work around when it comes to making money with bots. Could we be looking at a post-advertising world, when it comes to generating revenue?</p>
<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">From what I can tell, bot monetization will either be about mining data from users,&nbsp;paying for premium features, or a little of both. I'm still a few weeks off from having more examples of how the bots are generating revenue, but I wanted to make sure I recorded Slack's stance on the subject, for reference in future work.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Oct 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2016_10_13_at_9.17.46_pm.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>One request I get from folks on a regular basis, is an example of file upload APIs. Each time I get one of these requests I regret that I do not have more file upload and storage APIs profiled, allowing me to share a list of examples. So file upload APIs are high on my list to keep an eye out for as I'm doing my regular monitoring and mapping of the API universe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An API I wanted to add to this list was <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/ton">the&nbsp;TON (Twitter Object Nest) API</a>, which "allows implementers to upload media and various assets to Twitter".&nbsp;The TON API is an interesting model for me because it supports resumable, and non-resumable uploads--with all files over 64MB required to be resumable. I wanted to profile the API in a story, and add some of the key aspects to my research on file upload APIs, so that I could reference in future conversations.</p>
<p>Some of the core features of how the TON API operates are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Content-Type of requests cannot be application/x-www-form-urlencoded.</li>
<li>The Content-Type of requests&nbsp;are&nbsp;a valid media type as defined by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml">IANA</a>.</li>
<li>Chunks should be in integer multiples of X-TON-Min-Chunk-Size (except the last).</li>
<li>The Location header after upload needs to be saved to be used in other Twitter API calls.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is the basic makeup of the initial request to kick off a resumable upload:</p>
<ul>
<li>Authorization: See 3-legged authorization</li>
<li>Content-Length: Set to 0</li>
<li>Content-Type: The Content-Type of the asset to be uploaded.</li>
<li>X-TON-Content-Type: Identical to Content-Type</li>
<li>X-TON-Content-Length: Total number of bytes of the asset to be uploaded</li>
</ul>
<p>The initialization response contains a Location which can then be used in other calls to the Twitter API. After you make the resumable upload initialization call, you can make each of the follow-up chunk uploads for the file--here is an example resumable video upload request:</p>
<ul>
<li>PUT /1.1/ton/bucket/{bucket}/SzFxGfAg_Zj.mp4?resumable=true&amp;resumeId=28401873 HTTP/1.1</li>
<li>Authorization: // oAuth1.0a (3-legged) details here</li>
<li>Content-Type: video/mp4</li>
<li>Content-Length: {number of bytes transferred in this request}</li>
<li>Content-Range: bytes {starting position, inclusive, 0-indexed}-{end position, inclusive}/{total content length}</li>
</ul>
<p>Anything under 64MB in size can just be done in <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/ton/single-chunk">a single chunk</a>. Next, I'm going to create an OpenAPI Spec for <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/ton">the Twitter TON API</a>, and hack together a simple server side edition of it in PHP, just so I can play with a complete example, in a sandbox environment. I will play with the Twitter TON API as well, and get familiar with how it works in relationship to the rest of the Twitter API.</p>
<p>Once I profile the file upload APIs for a couple of other providers I will add as a single area of my API stack research. I'm hoping to establish a common set of design patterns that I can point people to when designing their own file upload APIs, providing a single repository of API definition patterns that anyone can fork and put to use.</p>

<p>We like to talk about the API economy in this space. It is kind of the grand dream of API obsessed, that helps us articulate how big of a deal we think APIs are going to be. We know APIs are going to be big, but in reality, the impact most APIs make don't size up. This is one of the reasons I'm such a big support of APIs in the public sector, as the potential for a positive impact tends to be greater in my opinion.</p>
<p>One of the APIs that has the potential to contribute at the API economy scale is out of a partnership between the Department of Labor and the University of Chicago--the <a href="http://www.dataatwork.org/">DataAtWork Open Skills API</a>. Providing "a complete and standard data store for canonical and emerging skills, knowledge, abilities, tools, technologies, and how they relate to jobs". Opening up a pretty useful API from their collaborative work to "<span>map the DNA or genome of the U.S. labor market."</span></p>
<p><a href="http://api.dataatwork.org/v1/spec/">The Open Skills API uses Swagger UI for the documentation</a>, which always makes me happy because it means there is <a href="http://api.dataatwork.org/v1/spec/skills-api.json">an OpenAPI Spec behind</a>, for use in <a href="http://getpostman.com">Postman</a>, <a href="http://apimatic.io">APIMATIC</a>, and other API solutions. It's a simple, open API, that has some serious potential for use in web, and mobile apps, as well as visualizations, analysis, and other types of applications--making it worthy to add the APIs in my list that I think could actually make an impact at API economy scale.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/screen_shot_2016_10_12_at_6.28.48_pm.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>My friend Jordan Walsh (<a href="https://twitter.com/jordwalsh">@jordwalsh</a>) just <a href="https://jordwalsh.com/2016/10/10/swagger-gist-io-saving-and-versioning-swagger-definitions/">released a new take on the Swagger editor</a>, that inches closer to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/19/my-dream-api-sketchbook-and-portfolio/">my vision of a dream API sketchbook and portfolio</a>. His&nbsp;<a href="http://swagger-gist.io">swagger-gist.io tool</a> allows you to open and save your API definitions to Github Gists, allowing you to use the snippet sharing solution to manage your API definitions, and their evolution.</p>
<p>While it isn't my entire vision for an API sketchbook and portfolio, swagger-gist.io's usage of Github Gists is a move in the right direction. This is just the first draft of his&nbsp;tool, and it looks like he plans on building in more of the API definition management features I am looking for--leveraging Github Gists as the book, in my sketchbook definition. #Creative</p>
<p>I like this model, especially when it comes to collaboration and storytelling around the API design process. I could see offering more sharing features for API definitions within the editor, enabling you to email, Slack, and share throughout an API's life cycle. I can also see more copy and paste opportunities, embedding API definitions using Github Gists in blog, knowledge base, and forum posts--grabbing the embed code from within the editor.</p>
<p>I'm curious to see where Jordan takes it. I have lots of ideas, but will just keep an eye on his work. My only critique at the moment is to not couple the functionality too tightly with the word "Swagger", as that is a trademarked product. I recommend relying on "OpenAPI Spec" or even better, some other way of identifying Gists that contain an OpenAPI Spec definition. ;-)</p>
<p>Cool stuff Jordan, keep up the good work.</p>

<p>I'm following along as the Sunlight Foundation winds down their operations and gathering any lessons along the way, that can help&nbsp;us open data and transparency folks can learn from as we do our work. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/23/learning-from-the-sunlight-foundation-situation-and-baking-transparency-into-projects/">I wrote earlier that we should be learning from the Sunlight Foundation situation and that we are making sure we bake transparency into our projects</a>&nbsp;and wanted to continue to extract wisdom we can reuse as they turn out the lights.</p>
<p>The Sunlight Foundation <a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2016/10/04/github-and-internet-archive-helping-to-preserve-the-sunlight/">shared that they are working with the Internet Archive and Github to preserve their projects</a>, and that they are "trying to ensure the open source community can understand and use our projects in the future" by:</p>
<ul>
<li>adding documentation</li>
<li>standardizing licenses&nbsp;</li>
<li>scrubbing sensitive info</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the benefits of being transparent and open by default is that you tend&nbsp;to do all of this in real-time. If you are in the business of opening up data, making it accessible with open APIs, you should be using Github, documenting, and telling the story as you go along. Then you do not have to do it all when you are walking away--everything is open by default.</p>
<p>This is why I work out in the open on Github each day, it allows people to take my tools like <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/csv-converter">the CSV Converter</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/api-stack/api-stack">the API Stack</a>, and put them to work, even as I'm still evolving them. When I step away from a project, it can continue to live on with all the code, definitions, schema, data, licensing, and the story behind in a nice forkable package--no extra work necessary.</p>
<p>Anyways, just a couple of nuggets to consider as we are working on open data and API project across the space.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-drone-signal.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was learning about&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/verizon-to-start-selling-wireless-data-plans-for-drones-1475774573">Verizon starting to sell wireless data plans for drones in the Wall Street Journal</a>, as part of my research on what could be a drone API stack. As an Internet of Things (IoT)&nbsp;concept, I find drones fascinating because they can have so many dimensions of APIs at play. The drone, its camera, battery, and other components can have APIs. They can publish video to Youtube, Facebook via APIs. They can receive real-time updates about weather, fire, infrastructure, and other changing events via APIs. This post is about thinking through about network API layer when it comes to drones.</p>
<p>If we are going to be rolling out networks for specific devices like drones, automobiles, and other IoT devices, it seems like every object should have an API, including the underlying network itself. As I wade through <a href="http://network.apievangelist.com/organizations/">the different companies in my network API research</a> and learn about <a href="http://api.openswitch.net/rest/dist/index.html">the myriad of ways web APIs are being exposed at the network level</a>, I am left thinking about the programmability of the network in service of specific devices like this, and what this will mean for net neutrality.</p>
<p>Let's take that to another level. What happens when drones can be programmed to fly around and either be the network, or program the network? This is what captivates&nbsp;me about drones and APIs. It all breaks me free from thinking about APIs from just a provider and consumer dimensions&nbsp;and blurs all the lines. I know that Verizon is just reselling its existing network to a new type of device ($$$), but I think the potential with rolling out networks for IoT devices will be in making sure it is also programmable, along with every object that is connected.</p>
<p>All of this opens up some really interesting security concerns&nbsp;when you have so many dimensions of the physical and virtual world possessing APIs. Drones with APIs, flying around providing and consuming APIs, redefining its own network with an API--it is a recipe for pure API mayhem. ;-) Well, for now, I'll add the reference for drone specific networks to my research, and keep my eye out for other device specific networks like this--maybe as I continue to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/08/18/expanding-my-awareness-of-how-apis-are-being-used-at-the-network-level/">push my understanding of software defined networks</a> forward, I can further&nbsp;merge the concepts more.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-hourglass.png" alt="" width="30%" align="right" /></p>
<p>While I still see a steady uptick in the number of hypermedia APIs out there in the wild, as well as conversations around the different media types that are available, I think we severely underestimated the time it would take for the average API developer to absorb and accept the concept. When you are immersed in any of the leading formats, from HAL to Siren, and you have the aha moment about why hypermedia makes sense, it can be easy to think everyone will see the future like we do. When in reality, I just don't think people are always seeking the wisdom in the same way, they are often just looking to get the job done.</p>
<p>It takes a lot of work to become hypermedia literate. An investment, not everyone can afford. While I am seeing more APIs employ hypermedia I have not seen an increase in the tooling and definitions we need to help developers speed up their understanding--providing examples they can reverse engineer. <a href="https://github.com/kevinswiber/siren">Siren is my hypermedia format</a> of choice&nbsp;and I found that <span>the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://developers.wurl.com/">TV and streaming video API platform Wurl</a>&nbsp;gave me a strong example to reverse engineer&nbsp;and learn from in my own journey.</p>
<p>Maybe not everyone learns like I do, but I can't help but feel like people need more common examples to learn from. I will spend some time going through <a href="http://hypermedia.apievangelist.com/apis/">the hypermedia APIs I've included in my research</a>, and generalize some of the design patterns that are present and publish them as simple examples on Github. I need to refresh my own hypermedia skills, as I dive back <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2015/12/02/realizing-i-need-hypermedia-to-bring-my-api-lifecycle-vision-to-life/">into my subway map API design</a>, which uses Siren as an enabler of the journey. It will also give me some good stories here on the blog--hypermedia is always an evergreen driver of users, as they Google for things in their hypermedia journey.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/webform/request-information-regarding-data-portability">The White House is looking for our thoughts on data portability</a>. While it is the U.S. federal government asking for our thoughts, something that could apply to our tax returns, veterans records, or student loan information. They seem to be most interested in what data portability means to us as consumers, or via many online services today--as the product.</p>
<p>Here is what they are looking for:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) is interested in understanding the benefits and drawbacks of increased data portability as well as potential policy avenues to achieve greater data portability. The views of the American people, including stakeholders such as consumers, academic and industry researchers, and private companies, are important to inform an understanding of these questions.</em></p>
<p>They want our input in 5000 words or less by&nbsp;<span>November 23, 2016. I am going to gather my own thoughts on data portability, and publish to API Evangelist, as well as submit via their RFI form. This is an extremely important topic&nbsp;and one I'm glad to see the White House picking up, and fingers crossed, will be moving forward in a consumer-centered way.</span></p>
<p><span>While I feel government open data is a critical piece of the puzzle, I think data literacy amongst consumer is just as critical. Data is what is fueling the tech sector, and in most scenarios, it is our personal data. The more control we have over this data, the better off we will be. The more opportunities we have to store locally, and migrate where we need to, the more data literate we will all be.</span></p>
<p><span>Anyways, I'll save my thoughts for my own response for the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/webform/request-information-regarding-data-portability">White House data portability RFI</a>. I'd love to hear your thoughts on the subject, if you want to post to your blog, or share with me via email.</span></p>

        <span class="post-date">12 Oct 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/acti_e77_10mp_od_dome_with_1027471.jpg" alt="" width="30%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I am continuing to learn from folks studying <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/who-makes-the-iot-things-under-attack/">the recent DDOS attack on Krebs on Security</a>. While not a straightforward API story, it overlaps with the API world in several ways, from the technical aspects of how the IoT devices were hacked and enlisted in the bot army, to how the hack has been analyzed online, and the sharing of machine-readable details of the attack.</p>
<p>There were some interesting nuggets from the attack analysis I wanted to include in my wider <a href="http://internet-of-things.apievangelist.com/">Internet of Things (IoT) research</a>. When it came to the security lapses in the surveillance cameras, printers, and other devices used as part of the DDOS, there were several key areas in play:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Username / Password - </strong>Default passwords for devices aren't changed, or the settings of unique passwords are not enforced. This makes it pretty easy to get right into the most common devices, after learning the default configuration.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play">Universal Plug and Play (UPnP)</a> - </strong>Increased usage of UPnP for the discovery and default opening up of networks to support device communication and monitoring. Often doing so without much consideration for security, and the bigger picture, serving the specific needs of a company and a single device.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Telnet/SSH_and_the_Command_Line">Telnet / SSH</a> - </strong>Even if one changes the password on the device&rsquo;s Web interface, the same default credentials may still allow remote users to log in to the device using telnet and/or SSH--providing a separate doorway for manufacturers, developers, and hackers to gain control over a device.</li>
<li><strong>Firmware Upgrades - </strong>A device may have had a patch released, but the actual firmware for a device has not actually been updated. The ease of installation, discover and access to the Internet, allows devices to be more easily installed by average folks unaware of wider security concerns, and the fact that devices&nbsp;will need to be updated regularly.</li>
</ul>
<p>While none of these areas speak directly to APIs, they definitely speak to some of the similar ways in which API security are compromised, and I think are also aspects of device operations that might be assisted, or improved upon with APIs. Right now I'm just adding this as security considerations for Internet of Things (IoT) implementations, but will also be keeping an eye out for any further role that APIs are playing in this type of attack, as well as the follow-up analysis.</p>
<p><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/who-makes-the-iot-things-under-attack/">Brian Krebs provides a wealth of insight into the attack</a>, as well as the multiple other reports I've read. Krebs provided a <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IoTbadpass-Sheet1.csv">CSV of the devices that had compromised passwords</a>, something I am going to add the company URL and logo, as well as more product information to. This will help me learn more about the products contributing to the mayhem, as well as the companies behind them. After that, I will put some more thought into how APIs can be put to work helping make sense of this growing problem--if nothing else we can just use them to make the forensic&nbsp;details of each attack available online, so we can sift through the wreckage easier with each future event.</p>
