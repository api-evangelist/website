<p>Building off a conversation I had with a fellow evangelist in the federal government today, regarding API service level agreements (SLA), I wanted to talk through some thoughts I&rsquo;m having about a couple of key <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">API building blocks</a>.</p>
<p>Reflecting what I see across the API space, API terms of service (TOS) are the legal agreement that API consumers agree to before using an API resource. API best practices, tends to reflect what the API TOS lays out, but are delivered in plain english, avoiding the legalese of the standard TOS. When these two building blocks (terms of service, best practices) are deployed well, an API consumer can easily make a decision on whether an API is in alignment with their goals, then also being able to pass it off to the lawyer for a deeper analysis.</p>
<p>Secondarily, API service level agreements (SLA) are the legal agreement that API providers agree to when offering up their service for consumption--setting the bar for what API consumers can expect from a service provider.</p>
<p>While TOS, SLA and best practices involve both API providers and consumers, I&rsquo;d say the TOS and best practices lean towards guiding API consumer behavior. Where the SLA leans toward guiding the API provider behavior. What I&rsquo;m looking for is a phrase to describe the friendlier, plain english version of an SLA. I want a building block that API providers can use to set the same eexpectations that a low-level SLA would, but without the legal baggage that comes with an SLA.</p>
<p>After reading through wikipedia entries, and several great articles on SLAs, and looking through what is contained in common SLAs, I&rsquo;m playing around with several phrases including <em>operational understanding, operational accord, and service accord</em>&mdash;leaning towards service accord, based upon the definition of accord:</p>
<ul>
<li>1) give or grant someone (power, status, or recognition).</li>
<li>2) (of a concept or fact) be harmonious or consistent with.</li>
</ul>
<p>Like best practices, a service accord would explain service levels in a plain english, non-binding way. An API consumer could read an API accord and get a pretty quick understanding what they can expect of an API service--if they have more questions and concerns they can read the SLA.</p>
<p>I think that API terms of service, best practices, service level agreements, and service accords can provide the building blocks necessary to define what is expected around both consuming, and providing of an API resource. I&rsquo;d love to hear your thoughts, what phrase do you think best represents a friendly version of an API service level agreements(SLA)?</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/03/13/the-power-of-designing-and-deploying-api-driven-resources-in-containers/">The Power Of Designing And Deploying API Driven Resources In Containers</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">13 Mar 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://autodevbot.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/autodevbot/autodevbot-icon.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>One of the transformative experiences of my career was when I worked for SAP, running SAP events as VP of Engineering at WebEvents Global. When I started, I was handed an architecture that was completely hosted in a hostage colocation facility, where I had no support. Long story short is, I was able to redefine my architecture using an API-centric approach,  coupled with AWS EC2 and S3 APIs, I re-deployed infrastructure piece by piece into the cloud, exiting my restrictive environment, but then also giving me a newfound agility, and the ability to scale in new an exciting ways, that were very liberating.</p>
<p>This experience was the birth of API Evangelist. After three years doing this, I needed a change, and knew that APIs was the space I wanted to be in, so I started a research blog to study the space--four years later I&rsquo;m still doing the research and publishing in real-time across the 60+ Github repos that make up API Evangelist. I evangelize APIs to not just spread the gospel of the technical benefits of APIs, I have remained passionate about APIs after four years by evangelizing the business, legal and cultural effects of an API-centric approach to business and government.</p>
<p>The ability to break up operations into little bite size resources, that allow these resources to be used in their current context, but also allowing them to be used in entirely new ways is very appealing. Along with a more modular approach to business, comes a flexibility, agility, and transparency that will change culture at any company, and potentially an entire industry, or <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/">industries as we saw with Amazon</a>. In my opinion business operations is about 30% technical, with the other 70% being about humans, and APIs deliver across 100% of that spectrum.</p>
<p>As it did in 2006, the cloud is playing a transformative role in the world APIs in 2014, building on the concept that an API is a single, modular resource, with the introduction of containers. Containers are a new approach to deploying cloud compute resources from providers like <a href="https://www.docker.io/">Docker</a>, <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">Amazon Cloud Formations</a>, and <a href="https://www.openshift.com/">Redhat Openshift</a>, that allow you to deploy small, isolated, modular compute resources from pre-defined blueprints.</p>
<p>This latest evolution will take one of the most important aspects of APIs and continue to taking it to the next level&mdash;modularity. APIs are about deploying simple, modular resources driven from data stores, code, and increasingly devices--containers allow you to deploy these same API resources but are:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Driven From Blueprints </strong>- Compute definition and functional code stored in blueprints that are managed via social coding environment like Github</li>
<li><strong>Isolated Resources </strong>- Each resource is independent, allowing for isolation and bundling within meaningful groups of development, deployment and production</li>
<li><strong>Run Anywhere -</strong> Local, sandbox, staging or production in the cloud, on-premise opening up operations to anywhere in the world&mdash;resource by resources</li>
<li><strong>API Surface Area - </strong>Simple, well defined API surface area for operations, deployment, testing and monitoring providing a single point of interaction</li>
</ul>
<p>Using multiple APIs is the way web and mobile apps are being built in 2014, providing a modular way to get the resources you will need for your apps. The containerization solutions available today allow you to take this further, changing the way you design, deploy, manage and scale the tens, hundreds and eventually thousands of API resources you will need for apps in the near future.</p>
<p>As I was exploring this new world of containerization I came across an API monitoring service called <a href="http://autodevbot.com/">AutoDevbot</a>, which monitors all your API endpoints, and notifies you when something goes wrong. Pretty standard feature in a new wave of API integration tools and services I&rsquo;m seeing emerge, but what is interesting is their&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/05/github-as-the-central-presence-definition-configuration-and-source-code-for-your-api/">use of Github as a central place to store the settings for the API monitoring service</a>.</p>
<p>After talking with the Garland Kan (<a href="https://twitter.com/gargar454">@gargar454</a>) of AutoDevBot, about this new containerization movement, and how they are using Github as a central configuration repository for their API monitoring service, I realized how this Github use was just the tip of iceberg when it came to the containerization of AutoDevBot. Everything about AutoDevBot is containerized.  You need a new data pipeline? They deploy a data pipeline container. You need a new NoSQL Data Store? They deploy a data pipeline container.</p>
<p><a href="http://autodevbot.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/autodevbot/autodevbot-data-pipeline.png" alt="" width="550" /></a></p>
<p>AutoDevBot is a suite of containers, that they&rsquo;ve organized into a workflow to help you monitor your API endpoints. AutoDevBot can design, develop, deploy, manage, and scale as needed, allowing them to orchestrate an experience, and resulting service that API providers need.  What AutoDevbot is doing represents the future of delivering digital services, across all industries.</p>
<p>This isn't my first, and won&rsquo;t be my last on APIs and virtualized containers. There is a lot of power in the containerization our valuable API resources, changing not just how we deploy APIs, but will evolve how developers consume APIs. APIs deployed as virtual containers, allow for the generation of valuable API blueprints that will be central to the API design process, as well as how define how APIs are deployed. Once deployed, containers will define how we scale, manage and orchestrate the valuable resources we depend on for everyday business, into agile, flexible, efficient and meaningful workflows that will drive the API economy.</p>

<p>I am getting psyched going through the <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/schedule.php">schedule lineup of 15 sessions</a> at <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/index.php">API Strategy &amp; Practice in Amsterdam</a>. In planning the session outline, Steve, Vanessa and I listened to what the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23APIStrat&amp;src=typd">#APIStrat</a> audience asked for after New York and San Francisco, which was more of the deep technical, as well as a balance of the business and politics of APIs.</p>
<p>I think our lineup delivers on this, which we've broken up into three tracks:</p>
<p><strong>API Provider</strong></p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/events/api-strategy-practice-conference/apistrat-sf-audience.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>

</ul>
<p>This lineup of sessions represent what we are seeing across the API space, with API design coming front and center, to hypermedia moving beyond an academic discussion and actually getting traction.  That is what <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/schedule.php">API Strategy &amp; Practice</a> is about, providing a venue to have discussions about the areas that are impacting the industry.</p>
<p>The best thing is, this is just the session lineup, we still have workshops, keynotes, fireside chats and panels.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Mar 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/trends/reciprocity.php"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/trends/reciprocity-trends.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m adding a new grouping to my list of <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">API management building blocks</a>, called reciprocity. If you want to know what I mean by reciprocity check out my earlier post <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/02/28/from-etl-to-api-reciprocity-looking-at-20-service-providers/">From ETL to API Reciprocity, Looking at 20 Service Providers</a>.</p>
<p>As I was working with Nimble the CRM system last night, and I was planning out some workflows associated with keeping contact data up to date, and noticed that Nimble provides access to <a href="https://zapier.com">Zapier automation tools</a> directly from their interface, using an iframe.</p>
<p>Providing access to API automation tools for your developers, and end-users, is an important piece of a larger reciprocity puzzle. As an API provider you should allow for developers and end-users to access, migrate, download, and orchestrate the flow of their own data.</p>
<p>With this in mind I&rsquo;m adding four building blocks for reciprocity as part of my API management recommendations:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Data Portability -</strong> Providing users with the ability to get data out of a system through a bulk download and via an API is essential to reciprocity existing. Along with other basic web literacy skills that every user should possess, every person should demand that any services they sign up for, should allow for data portability of all their resources. </li>
<li><strong>Terms of Service - </strong>The Terms of Service (TOS) is the central hub which makes the API economy work (or not work). TOS is where the protections for platform owners, developers and end-users exists. Restrictive TOS can suffocate the reciprocity of platform, while more sensible ones allow for the movement, and collaboration around resources that will make a platform thrive. </li>
<li><strong>oAuth -</strong> While not a perfect standard, oAuth is the best we have when it comes to providing an identify and access layer for API driven resource, one that allows for reciprocity to occur within a single API ecosystem, and between multiple ecosystems. oAuth gives the platform, developer and end-users a (potentially) equal role in who has access to API driven resources, governing how reciprocity is realized.</li>
<li><strong>Automation - </strong>Providers like Zapier and IFTT are delivering API automation services for hundreds of popular APIs, allowing developers and end-users to further automate their operations across multiple platforms, allowing anyone to better manage their resources using very simple API driven workflows.</li>
</ul>
<p>Reciprocity is not just about users getting the ability to download their data, so they can leave a platform. Reciprocity is about using APIs to empower everyone to maximize the exchange of resources. If a users is given a chance to use their data in other applications, and back again, the more valuable a resource will become, and the more likely a user will continue using a service&mdash;it is just good business.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/nimble/nimble-zapier-integration.png" alt="" width="575" /></p>
<p>I was able to use a service like Nimble to manage my contacts, which I first imported from Gmail, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter, then using the Nimble API I was able to publish contact from a proprietary CRM system. Now using Zapier, I&rsquo;m able to further automate workflow around my relationship management, adding to the features that are already available in Nimble.</p>
<p>None of this would be possible without reciprocity. Using Gmail, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Nimble and my own custom APIs, I am able to improve on how I manage my daily operations. This is why reciprocity is a pretty critical building block in how all of this is going to work. I put reciprocity in that space that is the overlap between the business and politics of APIs&mdash;that dark matter that helps make all of this API shit work.</p>

        <span class="post-date">12 Mar 2014</span>

<p>I am watching <a href="http://www.airpair.com/">Airpair</a> and <a href="https://theworkmob.com/">Workmob</a> step up to meet the demand for developer talent in the API space, and can&rsquo;t help but selfishly want to see the same for API evangelism talent.</p>
<p>Along with the growth of the API space, the need for quality API developer talent has grown exponentially. Airpair and Workmob have both identified this (obvious) need, and will do well, if they can truly qualify, organize and direct talent to where it is needed across the space.</p>
<p>I would call Airpair and Workmob, API talent agencies, with a focus on development. I want to see the same emerge for API evangelism, advocacy, or whatever label you give it where you are from. The need for developers is greater, but there is a huge, unmet demand for evangelists. This is literally from an email I received today:</p>
<blockquote><em>No one interesting is replying to our job postings, and I am wondering if you have any thoughts or suggestions on who the right person is and how to find them.</em></blockquote>
<p>I see this throughout the week, and feel bad for many of the companies reaching out. An API evangelism talent agency wouldn&rsquo;t be your average marketing or PR agency. An API evangelism talent agency would have to be a tech savvy group, bringing not just outreach skills to the table, but some serious hacking chops.</p>
<p>If you have the desire (and resources) to start such an agency, let me know. I don&rsquo;t have the desire to run such an operation (or the resources), but I have the understanding of what the market needs, and can probably bring all the clients you'd need.</p>

<p>I wish I had more time to take many of the questions I get behind the scenes via email and publish as stories, but with an insane inbox I only can make time for some of the more relevant ones. I had one from a couple weeks ago that I just got around to responding to, which had to do with which support building blocks should an API provider use. This particular question comes from Jamie Parkins (<a href="https://twitter.com/jamieparkins">@jamieparkins</a>) from <a href="http://www.justgiving.com/">JustGiving</a>:</p>
<blockquote><em>In your experience of documented APIs, when you come across the need for help, do you find the simple Google Group approach works or do you prefer the more ticket like approach that a Zendesk might offer (and possibly wrapped with some FAQs)? I only have a resource of 1 dev so have to pick my battles carefully but I can't help thinking I'll end up gaining time if I can help users solve their own problems or questions better from the start (i.e. A self service approach)</em></blockquote>
<p>Which building blocks you use in supporting your community is a balancing act based upon the amount of resources you have, the size of your community, and the types of users you have in your API community. Based upon what I've seen available at other APis, and the one's I've developed strategy for, you try and balance between <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">self-service and direct support building blocks</a>--with emphasis on self-service and asynchronous communication.</p>
<p>Depending on your target audience, some consumers may be needier than others, and will not be accustom to self-service API approaches, coming from more of a sales and direct support culture. The goal within any API community is to steer as many of these users as you can towards a self and community supported model, but you want to make sure your company is actively present as well, engaging and supporting your developers&mdash;not absent and relying just on your community and self-service.</p>
<p>There is no standard template for how to support your API community, the best way is actively engage with developers via real-time channels like Twitter, or at least asynchronous tools like Github Issue Management, and Forums.  Get to know your users, understand who they are, what they need, then provide as many self-service support resources as you can, augmented with your human presence.</p>

        <p><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/AWS_LOGO_CMYK.jpg" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been profiling the API management space for almost four years now, and one of the things I keep track of is what some of the <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">common building blocks of API management</a> are. Recently I&rsquo;ve pushed into other areas like <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">API design</a>, <a href="http://integration.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">integration</a> and into <a href="http://payments.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">payment APIs</a>, trying to understand what the common elements providers are using to meet developer needs.</p>
<p>Usually I have to look through the sites of leading companies in the space, like the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/26/payment-apis-that-i-am-watching/">38 payment API providers</a> I&rsquo;m tracking on to find all the building blocks that make up the space, but when it came to cloud computing it was different. While there are several providers in the space, there is but a single undisputed leader&mdash;<a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Cloud Services</a>. I was browsing through AWS yesterday and I noticed their new products &amp; solutions menu, which I think has a pretty telling breakdown of the building blocks of cloud APIs.</p>

<p>The reason I look through at these spaces in this way, is to better understand the common services that API providers are, that are really making developers lives easier. Through assembling a list of the common building blocks, it allows me look at the raw ingredients that makes things work, and not get hunt up with just companies and their products.</p>
<p>There is a lot to be learned from API pioneers like Amazon, and I think this list of building blocks provides a lot of insight into what API driven resources the are truly making the Internet operate in 2014.</p>

<p>I am spending time getting to know the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/09/i-am-up-to-34-apis-out-of-the-netherlands/">APIs coming out of the Netherlands</a>, as we prepare for <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/index.php">API Strategy &amp; Practice in Amsterdam March 26-28th</a>, and one API I was checking out is from the Portfolio platform <a href="http://www.viewbook.com/" target="_blank">Viewbook</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.viewbook.com/api/">Viewbook provides an API</a> for users to add and manage their photos, building very attractive portfolios for photographers. What I thought was pretty cool when I was going through their API, was their re-use of the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/services/api/">Flickr API</a> design, rather than re-inventing their own.</p>
<p>Viewbook is a great argument why we need <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>, and a central, sensibly licensed place to find leading API patterns that providers can put to use. There are a lot of benefits for Viewbook to use the same design as Flickr, allowing developers to reuse code and other resources available as part of the Flickr API ecosystem--as well as just developer familiarity with the interface.</p>
<p>When it comes to many types of APIs, there is no reason to reinvent the wheel, and making use of the best API patterns already available just makes sense. Help me convince API providers to <a href="http://apicommons.org/add-apis.html">contribute their API designs to the commons,</a> to help startups like Viewbook save time, and be successful in delivering their tools and services that make users lives easier--something that will only make all of our API communities stronger.</p>

        <p><a href="http://apiary.io/" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/apiary/apiary-logo-300x93.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I spent some time developing a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/08/hello-world-product-api-with-blueprint-raml-and-swagger/">hello world product API with Blueprint, RAML And Swagger</a> this last week, and along the way I had several experiences that I think are influential in the API design process. One of these was while I was designing my product API using <a href="http://apiary.io">Apiary.io</a>.</p>
<p>After I had gotten to a certain point in my design, and I wanted to see it in action, so I clicked on the preview button. A panel slid out showing me the interactive documentation my developers will see when it is published, and potentially see how it will work with sample API responses, and code samples in a variety of programming languages.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/apiary/apiary-preview-code.png" alt="" width="550" /></p>
<p>Just like interactive API documentation has been important in teaching developers about an API interface, it will also assist API providers in understanding their own interface throughout the design process, and be able to better articulate the interface to developers.</p>
<p>Another important thing I saw exposed in the Apiary preview pane was code samples for making calls against my product API in PHP, Python, Ruby, C#, Visual Basic, JavaScript, and Node.js.  I think this option, built into the API design process is a pretty significant part of the lifecycle, by providing API designers with a constant reminder that their API interface will be consumed in a variety of languages.</p>
<p>A common mistake I see from API deployments is that developers see the world through the lens of their preferred programming language. I&rsquo;ve seen very PHP centric design patterns, ones that cater to .NET and even APIs that consider only Node.js in their interface design patterns. It is not just the fact that they are thinking only in their programming language that is a problem, its just the fact that they aren't willing see the world through the eyes of their potential developers.</p>
<p>Anything we can do to expand the horizons of API developers during the API design process, helping them see the wider world they are entering into by exposing their API, is a good thing.</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Mar 2014</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-gears-questions.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" />APIs are being used as the pipes that drive mobile apps, and beginning to connect our homes, automobiles, buildings and public space to the Internet. The decision on whether or not this is a good idea isn not even on the table, it is already happening, and there isn't anything you can do about it.</p>
<p>What matters now is the path we take, and how open these API pipes are, how transparent providers are, how inclusive they are to developers and end users, and how much we respect privacy and invest in security. The big challenge in all of this is how do we steer all the actors in this new API economy towards a healthy balance:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Providers</strong> - The potential of innovation and new partnerships, as well as access to new talent, and fresh ideas around a company's resources.</li>
<li><strong>Developers</strong> - Access to free and low cost resources for apps, that they couldn't create on their own.</li>
<li><strong>End-Users</strong> - Access to apps that entertain and meet their needs, with better control over content and data, as well as privacy and security.</li>
<li><strong>Government</strong> - All government being machine readable by default, increasing efficiency, as well as transparency along the way.</li>
</ul>
<p>APIs offer a lot of benefits for everyone involved, and are quickly establishing a presence across all business sectors. When it comes to APIs, most of the benefit comes not from the technical usage of APIs, it will be from healthy business and political aspects that empower and incentivize not just companies, but developers and the end-users to build new things.</p>
<p>I don't evangelize APIs just so they get deployed, I evangelize API in hopes of persuading companies to adopt an API-centric approach to operating their company, a way of life that opens it up to partners, and the public&mdash;changing the culture of the company, the way it does business, and potentially changing the way we all do business.</p>
<p>There are just as many ways to exploit individuals via APIs, as there are ways to benefit users, companies and entire industries with APIs, it is up to us which future we create&mdash;the API economy is here, which version of it are you investing in?</p>

<p><span>As we gear up for&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/index.php">API Strategy &amp; Practice in Amsterdam, March 24-26th</a><span>, I&rsquo;m spending my time getting to know API companies across Europe. I published a&nbsp;</span><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/27/apis-coming-out-of-the-united-kingdom/">listing of APIs I found from the United Kingdom</a><span>&nbsp;a few days ago, and next up is taking a look at what APIs are coming out of the Netherlands.</span></p>
<p>Last week I did a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/04/apis-coming-out-of-the-netherlands/">roundup of 17 APIs out of the Netherlands</a>, but thanks to Twitter, and specifically&nbsp;Gerard van Enk (<a href="https://twitter.com/gvenk">@gvenk</a>) who was curating a spreadsheet of APIs, I was able to double the amount of APIs I'm tracking on out of the country.</p>

<p>The educational system in the Netherlands is complex, and many public bodies are tasked with keeping schools and students on the right track. However, data regarding this task is made available to the general public in a way it is not easily processable, which makes checks by the public (and press) more difficult. The OpenOnderwijs API alleviates this problem by providing a unified interface to data on education collected from several institutions with different responsibilities with regard to the Dutch educational system, such as DUO, Onderwijsinspectie and Vensters voor Verantwoording. The OpenOnderwijs API is built on open source technology, such as Scrapy for scraping school data (the scrapers can be found at Github), Sphinx for the documentation, and ElasticSearch for efficient data storage and retrieval. Also, all school addresses are geocoded using the BAG42 service, an Dutch initiative aiming to integrate high quality, official data sources with &ldquo;regular&rdquo; geocoding.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 Mar 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-building-blocks-design.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>Over the last couple months I&rsquo;ve been taking a deeper look at the API design space, trying to understand more about the tools and services that are emerging, and the different approaches being employed throughout the API design lifecycle.</p>
<p>I started first with trying to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/22/the-evolving-motivations-behind-api-definitions/">understand the evolving motivations behind why people are using API definitions</a>, then I spoke with API with the creators of API Blueprint, RAML and Swagger, the three leading API design providers out there, to understand more about the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/31/the-vision-behind-swagger-api-blueprint-and-raml/">vision behind their various approaches to API design</a>.</p>
<p>After talking to each of the providers, I wanted to understand more about the tooling that was emerging from each of the providers, and went through what has emerged out of each of the Blueprint, RAML and Swagger communities.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m continuing my research this week this time and expanding my understanding of the differences between the three API definition formats of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/27/api-design-tooling-from-api-blueprint/">API Blueprint</a>, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/01/api-design-tooling-from-raml/">RAML</a> and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/25/api-design-tooling-from-swagger/">Swagger</a>.  To push my understanding of each approach I worked on developing an API definition for a simple product API, in each of the three formats.</p>
<p><strong>API Blueprint</strong><br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/9442237.js"></script>
</p>
<p><strong>RAML</strong><br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/9442232.js"></script>
</p>
<p><strong>Swagger</strong><br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/9442340.js"></script>
</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not done with each of these definitions, I&rsquo;m still learning the nuances of each of the approaches to describing an API, but I learned a lot about each of the definition formats.  Honestly, each format has its pros and cons, but all of them get you to the end goal of being able to describe an API interface.</p>
<p><strong>JSON vs. Markdown</strong><br /> While evaluating the I can&rsquo;t help but bring some of my personal baggage to the table. When it comes to JSON vs. Markdown I feel like I&rsquo;m in 2008 and struggling to leave my love of XML behind and learn JSON, secondarily some of the same emotions I&rsquo;m having switching my blogs to use Jekyll where I can use either HTML or Markdown for my posts. In short, I have more experience with Swagger, and I love me some JSON, so the markdown is harder for me to adopt. This is just my baggage, but I&rsquo;m sure others will face it as well.</p>
<p>I personally have a preference for Swagger, because of my experience with it and the JSON formatting, but I can buy into the promise of a markdown approach like RAML and API Blueprint.  I feel like Swagger is machine readable formats, while Blueprint and RAML are more technical specifications. I&rsquo;m not completely sold on the fact that markdown will be significantly more easier for non-developers than the JSON format, something I&rsquo;ve stated before, but I could see a new breed of API designers emerge who will have a fondness for markdown over the JSON.</p>
<p><strong>All About The Tooling</strong><br /> The big thing I experienced in this process is understanding the difference the tooling makes. Using Apiary.io for designing with API Blueprint, the API Designer from from Mulesoft for working with RAML, makes a huge difference in the process. There is no design tooling for Swagger, using Apiary and API Designer showed me the importance the tools will play in the future of API design&mdash;I think it will be the tools, not necessarily the API definition formats that become the differentiator.</p>
<p>I think it will be the tools that will help API designers become fluent in either RAML, Blueprint or Swagger, much like WYSIWG editors have done for HTML. Each API definition format will be how we share, communicate and collaborate through the API design lifecycle, but the tooling will be how we create, manage and publish API definitions--few will hand-write API definitions.</p>
<p><strong>Templates</strong><br /> Maybe its just the way that I learn, but one thing that would help through the process of becoming fluent in RAML, Blueprint or even Swagger would be templates that act as live examples. I was able to find hello world examples for both Blueprint and RAML that I could work backwards from to learn each API definition format, but making templates more available would help. Apiary gives you a nice starter template when you first kick off a new API, and both provide you with a wealth of documentation to work from, but a library of API design templates of various complexity and applications would facilitate the learning process.</p>
<p>These are just some of my thoughts after spending time trying to define the same API design in three different API definition formats. I will keep pushing forward with my research into <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">API design</a>, and share as many stories as I can. I think I need to generate more API definitions in RAML and API Blueprint, before I will truly understand the nuances between each of the platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I'm adding Mike Amundsen's (<a href="https://twitter.com/mamund">@mamund</a>)&nbsp;<a href="https://gist.github.com/mamund/9443276">Hello World Products API in ALPS</a> he referenced below. I think it is a very intuitive, and clean approach to defining API interfaces, and it makes me happy to see so many roads to get to the same place--some roads are short, some are long, some have scenery and some are just on the freeway. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Github just announced <a href="https://github.com/blog/1790-announcing-the-github-developer-program">a new developer program</a>, which will allow <a href="http://developer.github.com/v3/">Github API</a> developers to receive notifications about upcoming changes to the API, and get early access on some feature releases.</p>
<p>As part of the new developer program, you can also submit your work for inclusion on their <a href="https://github.com/integrations">integrations page</a>, which is essentially a showcase of the best Github integrations out there.</p>
<p>A beta program or refined developer group within your API ecosystem makes sense. Having an API access tier where the more engaged developers can step up, and play a closer role in the API roadmap, can bring some serious value to the table.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve blogged about the benefits of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/31/four-potential-levels-of-an-api-business-ecosystem/">multiple levels of API access</a> for a couple years now, and Github&rsquo;s approach shows their API ecosystem is maturing, and they are further formalizing the incubation of ideas, applications and partnerships within the Github API ecosystem.</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Mar 2014</span>
        <p><a title="Pop Up Archive" href="https://www.popuparchive.org/" target="_blank"><img class="c1" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/pop-up-archive/pop-up-archive-logo.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>One of the most enjoyable thing about being the API Evangelist is talking to API providers about their strategy, and helping brainstorm what they should do next. I have multiple APIs I do this with regularly, either because I&rsquo;m an advisor, big fan, or simply because they pay me. ;-) My favorite discussions are from the providers that are fine with me retelling their story publicly, APIs like the <a href="https://www.cashtie.com/">Cashtie API</a> and the <a href="https://popuparchive.com/">Popup Archive</a>.</p>
<p>Anne and Bailey over at Popup, a audio transcription API, talk with me regularly about their API development, deployment and now evangelism strategy. The Popup Archive API meets the first rule of APIs for me&mdash;do one thing and do it well, providing clear value for developers. The Popup Archive does this with audio transcription, opening up a whole world of audio to being searchable via an API. Think about the potential of making old radio programs indexed, and searchable online, giving new life to legacy content.</p>
<p>Anne and Bailey have built a high value web site and API, and recently finished their <a href="https://developer.popuparchive.com/">interactive documentation</a>, and are ready for business. They are at that amazingly exciting, and at the same completely terrifying step of having to evangelize their API and make the rubber meet the road--they have a valuable API resource, but now what?</p>
<p>Anne and Bailey have some great ideas about how the audio transcription API could be used, and they have some partners who are kicking the tires, understanding what is possible with integrating with Popup Archive API. This is where you start! You harness the ideas, and the early integrations and you tell the story of how the Popup Archive is providing a solution. Tell these stories on the Popup Archive Blog, on the Twitterz, and anywhere else you can find an audience.</p>
<p><a title="Pop Up Archive" href="https://www.popuparchive.org/" target="_blank"><img class="c1" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/pop-up-archive/old%2Btime%2Bradio.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Then launch a formal idea showcase where you can submit ideas on how the Popup Archie could be put to use, allow people to browse and search the idea showcase and imagine what is possible. Next establish a section for actual case studies, and as partners and other developers successfully integrate, tell these stories as well, but in a more formal way, demonstrating established approaches for putting the Popup Archive API to use&mdash;not just the dreamy ideas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next I told them to start monitoring the landscape of where they think their potential users are, find the radio stations, and media outfits who have Twitter accounts. Understand who the audiofiles, archivists, DJs, performers and bloggers who care the most about the audio space. Spend time each week discovering, living and understanding this space, all while you are telling stories about the Popup Archive and its valuable API.</p>
<p>Gather your ideas on how an API could be put to use, showcase how the API is being actively used, tell the stories, and actively explore and get to know the landscape of the online world you think will find the API resource most valuable. Eventually you will find more stories, build relationships with new developers, and discover other business interests that can put the API to use. Its a natural, ongoing API evangelism cycle&mdash;not to be confused with marketing or sales.</p>
<p>In the end its not just API evangelism, its about building your own awareness of a space, and telling stories of the value your API delivers&mdash;then repeat, repeat, repeat. Each week you will learn more, your storytelling voice will get stronger, your community will get bigger, and your API will grow and mature.</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 Mar 2014</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-stack-cash.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>There is an interesting conversation triggered by a <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/us-government-apis/mQlwYRK5Y_0">question from Mr. Gray Brooks at the GSA on the federal government API Google Group</a>, regarding whether there are any agencies who are charging for access to their APIs. I thoroughly enjoy the growing community of open data and API folks that are operating around city, state and federal government currently, and how we are all turning these questions into full blown conversations that can actually help move things forward.</p>
<p>First Luke Fretwell(<a href="https://twitter.com/lukefretwell">@lukefretwell</a>)&nbsp;from Govfresh responded with <a href="http://govfresh.com/2014/03/government-charge-api-fees/">Should government charge API fees?</a> I totally agree with Luke, that we shouldn't be imposing fees on API consumers at this stage, potentially scaring users off, or stifling innovation that could occur. Government should understand that the costs of data gathering, publishing, and managing APIs should be an accepted cost of doing business as a public entity. Luke ends with potentially charging for high volume usage in the future, but for now let the resources flow!</p>
<p>Next Mark Head(<a href="https://twitter.com/mheadd">@mheadd</a>), Open Data Evangelist for City of Philadelphia chimed in with <a href="http://civic.io/2014/03/07/apis-to-charge-or-not-to-charge/">APIs : To Charge or Not to Charge</a>. Mark makes three excellent points that need to be considered before you charge for access to APIs 1) identifying who is using government APIs 2) APIs as a shared resource 3) sustainability of IT infrastructure.  Mark nails it, in that that are more questions to be asked, and great deal of understanding needs be achieved before you can answer the question of &ldquo;to charge or not to charge&rdquo;.</p>
<p><strong>Getting To Know Your Resources</strong><br /> Before government agencies consider charging for their API resources, they need to make sure they have an intimate understanding of what it takes to operate and scale existing APIs. Many people feel that applying API keys to government APIs is bad, and is all about locking up or controlling public data. In reality, keying up API access, measuring how APIs are actually used, applying meaningful metrics, presenting in sensible dashboards is how you begin the process of getting intimate with your API resources and how they are used&mdash;something government agencies need to step up.  There is not excuse for not doing this--there are <a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">freemium solutions in private sector like 3Scale</a>, and you have your own <a href="http://bit.ly/1g6zFJf">open source solution for government with API Umbrella</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Getting To Know Your Audience</strong><br /> Before government agencies consider charging for their API resources, they need to make sure they have initiate understanding of who is using their APIs. There is no way that you can set a price for an API resource, without knowing who is going to use it, and what price point the market will bear. If the API resource you are deploying is being used by civic open data groups, the market won't take much, but if consumers of the API resource is large financial institutions, it is an entirely different conversation. Price shouldn't just be based upon covering costs, as Mark said their are other considerations with APIs being a shared resource&mdash;in short there will be numerous conversations that have to happen before pricing can be set, and a healthy understanding of who is using your APIs, and how they are putting them to use is critical.</p>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist/federal-government/nationl-park-ranger.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>My answer to whether government should charge for APIs, is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">yes</span>. We have to make sure and cover the costs of operations, and make sure new API resources get funded. However I second Luke and Mark as well, we can't let pricing get in the way of API usage, and there are many variables to consider before pricing can be set. My personal opinion is that all government APIs should require keys, so that agencies can measure and understand API usage, if developers want to get full downloads of data they can, but to use APIs you need to register and key up.  Entry level tiers should allow for sensible rate limits, but always cap usage, with the expectation that developers can request rate limit increases, which at some point may warrant the charging of fees. If all agencies employ this method, APIs can still be freely accessed, agencies have the data they need to better understand how APIs are use, and by whom, and heavy or specialized API usage can be dealt with on a case by case basis&mdash;leaving open the potential for fees applied to API usage in future&hellip;or not.</p>
<p>I still like the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/02/01/should-the-government-subsidize-and-profit-from-data-markets/">city and national park example </a>I pulled from a conversation with Andrew Nicklin(<a href="https://twitter.com/technickle">@technickle</a>) in New York a couple years ago. Some public parks are free and open, some have small usage fees, but all commercial activity on public lands requires additional levels of access, fees and even revenue sharing in some situations.  We just haven't applied the same thought process to our virtual public lands, and like we had to do in the early days of governing our public lands, we have some experimentation, learning and standardization to do around the management of our virtual public resources.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/03/06/so-you-wanna-do-a-spreadsheet-or-database-to-api-startup/">So You Wanna Do a Spreadsheet or Database To API Startup</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">06 Mar 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/bw-spreadsheet-db.png" alt="" width="220" align="right" /></p>
<p>A question I get regularly at API Evangelist is around the need for spreadsheet to API, and database to API services. Every couple weeks I get DMs and emails from someone who ask what tools are available, and that they were thinking about developing a solution. Right now I have three separate people asking this, and rather than just reply in email I figured I&rsquo;d write a piece to respond, based upon my experience.</p>
<p>First, let me state that there is a need for simple spreadsheet to API solution. Much of the worlds data is locked up in spreadsheets, and in control of data stewards who don't access to API deployment resources. However, I'm not sure there is a lot of money to be made in providing this as a service, i feels like something that should just be default for all spreadsheet operations&mdash;you know like Google Spreadsheet.</p>
<p>Google Spreadsheet allows XML and JSON access to spreadsheets by default. in addition to the full blown <a href="https://developers.google.com/google-apps/spreadsheets/">Google Spreadsheet API</a>.&nbsp;The only problem is with Google Spreadsheet you have some size limitations that make it a solution for only the simplest of data sources. I have written several posts on deploying APIs from Google Docs for both <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/10/22/deploy-api-public-google-spreadsheet-to-api/">public</a> and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/11/12/deploy-api-private-google-spreadsheet-to-api/">private</a> spreadsheets, and have received numerous requests for a cloud version of this functionality, that would allow anyone to quickly deploy APIs from Google Spreadsheet sources.</p>
<p>I think the fact that Google Spreadsheet is free to use, and has API access to is spreadsheets, make this a real tough space to make money in, even if you do smooth out the process. To further convince people to not reinvent the wheel, there is already the &ldquo;Wordpress&rdquo; for data management, called <a href="http://ckan.org/">CKAN</a>, which is, "a powerful data management system that makes data accessible &ndash; by providing tools to streamline publishing, sharing, finding and using data.&rdquo; CKAN is open source, and a tool that city, state, county and federal governments around the globe are downloading and deploying in growing numbers.</p>
<p>Even with the availability of Google Spreadsheet and its API, and data portal solutions like CKAN, this is still a problem I try to tackle from time to time, when I get the same itch as the people who have triggered this post. I&rsquo;ve created what I call my OnGithub solutions, which allows for data management via Github, and API deployment using simple AWS hosted API framework.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://data.ongithub.com/">Data.OnGithub.com</a></strong> - My attempt at providing users with a free (if publicly licensed) place to upload and manage their open data that originates in spreadsheets and CSVs within Github repositories.  The entire app runs on Github Pages, using HTML, CSS ad JavaScript for core functionality, making it something that can be forked and implemented by anyone.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://api.ongithub.com/">API.OnGithub.com</a></strong> - My attempt to provide the API layer on top of data.ongithub.com, separating the data management from the API deployment. This application runs as simple PHP API framework, deployed on Linux on AWS.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.socrata.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/socrata/socrata-vertical.jpeg" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>While this work was interesting, it still didn&rsquo;t solve the problem of allowing the average data steward to easily manage their data that is warehoused in spreadsheets, and deploy APIs with no technical experience required.  However it was a fun exercise to see what is possible for developing open tooling around this problem.</p>
<p>When it actually comes to deploying services that address data management I&rsquo;ve watched providers like <a href="http://www.infochimps.com/">InfoChimps</a> try and end up pivoting, and others such as Kasabi and Emergent One try, then go out of business. There are successful providers like <a href="http://www.slashdb.com/">SlashDB</a>, <a href="http://www.junar.com/">Junar</a>, and <a href="http://www.socrata.com/">Socrata</a>, who focus on providing open data platforms, whether it originates from a database or a spreadsheet. In 2014 I predict we will continue to see new startups emerge that promise to solve this problem, but will run into walls when it comes to monetization. There is money to be made in delivering APIs from spreadsheets, there just won&rsquo;t be VC level money to be made when it comes to converting spreadsheets to APIs, but if you want to provide some open tooling and provide professional services, I think you can make an acceptable living.</p>
<p>The moral of this story is that if you want to do a startup, get funding and offer a data solution, you better demonstrate you have something really new and innovative, otherwise don&rsquo;t bother, the space is saturated. If you want to develop some open tools, or use existing open tools and help organizations tackle their open data problems, I think there is plenty of opportunity to make both significant change, but also make some money offering sensible consulting services.</p>

<p>I had the pleasure of doing <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKWgzOjgAjM">Carvoyant Connected Car Cast today with Bret Tobey and Matt Galvin, hosted by the infamous Mike Maney (@the_spinmd) today</a>. The session was nothing formal, just a conversation about cars and APIs.</p>
<p>The conversation triggered several potential stories for me, but after the talk I couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking about how they talked about the <a title="Carvoyant" href="http://www.carvoyant.com/" target="_blank">Carvoyant API</a> being a research &amp; development (R&amp;D) lab, and conversation starter about whats next for the automobile industry.</p>
<p>Auto companies are on board with APIs playing a significant role in the future of the auto industry, but their window for change is in not just years, but multiple years. Tech giants like Google and Apple are turning their attention to the opportunities surrounding the connected car, but their runway is pretty lengthy as well&mdash;highly dependent on the car manufacturers.</p>
<p><a title="Carvoyant" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKWgzOjgAjM" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/carvoyant/carvoyant-connected-car-cast.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Carvoyant has options for connecting cars right now, providing a device you can plug in cars that are 1996 and newer, and an API for developers to build apps that integrate with user&rsquo;s vehicles. Carvoyant isn&rsquo;t about delivering content to your vehicle like Apple and Google are working on, it is about getting data from your vehicle, about its location, engine, tires, fuel and other vehicle data points and automobile centric events.</p>
<p>Like other Internet connected devices in our lives its going to take some experimentation before we find the right formula that works for people and their beloved cars, the sort of R&amp;D that APIs are well suited for. I think vehicles play a pretty clear role in our lives, we understand the value they deliver, but I think its going to take some time to understand how to safely, and sensibly connect our cars to the Internet, and we need to jumpstart this conversation&mdash;not let it just be between car manufacturers and tech giants, but include auto enthusiasts, mechanics, developers and most importantly car owners.</p>
<p>As with other industries API are moving into, I&rsquo;m extremely excited about the opportunities, but also very concerned with the potential for exploitation of end-users. As we move towards a world of connected cars, we need to have some serious conversations appropriate uses of technology, access to data, privacy, security and numerous other challenges we face with the API connected automobile.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited that Carvoyant is available to connect cars now, and not having waiting for each year of new vehicles from manufacturers, allowing us to jumpstart not just the research &amp; development, but also the conversation about what a connected car in our world actually means.</p>

<p>As with all of my research, this is ongoing. My hopes is to better educate myself (and you too), about the payment API sector, which I consider a pretty critical aspect of the overall API economy.</p>

<p>I have a number of <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/08/02/the-apis-that-i-depend-on-for-my-business/">APIs that I've successfully integrated with</a>, and an even greater number that I've just played around with, pulling data, seeing what is possible. If you have spent the time learning what an API does, and gotten familiar with the interface, that is worth something.  If you've successfully integrated with an API, understand its ins and outs, have code in production that depends on that API&mdash;that is worth a lot.</p>
<p>With all of this experience in working with APIs, how do you demonstrate it? We are seeing <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/04/finding-good-api-developer-talent-is-hard/">freelance agencies emerge that are focused on delivering developer talent</a> that companies can put to use when building web and mobile apps using APIs&mdash;how will they demonstrate an individuals skills when it comes to a variety of APIs?</p>
<p>At some point we are going to need some sort of badging or credentialing system to help us demonstrate the mad API skills we all possess. I'm not talking badges in terms of check-ins or game levels, I&rsquo;m talking it terms of demonstrated project experience on specific APIs. How much of an API interface have I hacked on? Do I have production experience with an API, if so how much?</p>
<p>There needs to be a central badge authority, using an open technology like <a href="http://openbadges.org/">Mozilla Open Badges</a>, and each API provider can work to establish various levels of badging. There will probably be a lot of meaningless badges that will emerge, but I think if we work at it, we can establish some real ways to measure and demonstrate API talent.</p>
<p>Right now I have a lot of API related experience, but no real way demonstrate this to any company or individual, beyond my blog, Twitter, Github and my charming personality. It would be cool if we could establish a badging and credential system that would work for quantifying all the amazing talent in the API sector and make sure it is put to good use.</p>

<p>The shortage of good API developer talent is something I see regularly, with the constant stream of job and project offers I get via email and LinkedIn. The first place companies and recruiters go when looking for API evangelists, developer evangelists, and API developers is apievangelist.com.</p>
<p>I feel bad for some of the newbies I encounter, thinking they are going to easily find API talent. There just aren&rsquo;t enough developers who demonstrate their API skills, and even fewer who strive to be API evangelists. With the growth of the space, this is increasingly a problem, something I think is beginning to turn around.</p>
<p>I recently stumbled across a site called APIXChange which focused on delivering API developer talent, but has recently pivoted to become Workmob:</p>

<p>I think Workmob and Airpair are just the beginning. We will see talent shops who focus specifically on API developers, and eventually specific API sectors like healthcare, government, and education. We will also see PR agencies emerge that offer API evangelism and developer advocacy as a service, grooming the next generation of evangelist armies, and satisfying the needs of a growing API industry.</p>
<p>It is interesting to watch the API universe expand and new crops of specialized services that are focused on APIs emerge.</p>

<p>Over the last couple months I&rsquo;ve been taking a deeper look at the API design space, trying to understand more about the tools and services that are emerging, and the different approaches being employed throughout the API design lifecycle.</p>
<p>I started first with trying to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/22/the-evolving-motivations-behind-api-definitions/" target="_blank">understand the evolving motivations behind why people are using API definitions</a><a>, then I spoke with API with the creators of API Blueprint, RAML and Swagger, the three leading API design providers out there, to understand more about the </a><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/31/the-vision-behind-swagger-api-blueprint-and-raml/" target="_blank">vision behind their various approaches to API design.</a></p>
<p>After talking to each of the providers, I wanted to understand more about the tooling that was emerging from each of the providers:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/27/api-design-tooling-from-api-blueprint/" target="_blank">API Blueprint</a></li>
<li><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/03/01/api-design-tooling-from-raml/" target="_blank">RAML</a></li>
<li><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/25/api-design-tooling-from-swagger/" target="_blank">Swagger</a></li>
</ul>
<p>While each of these providers have their own approach to defining APIs, and the API design lifecycle, after looking through what they offer, you start seeing patterns emerge. After reviewing what API Blueprint, RAML and Swagger bring to the table, I squinted my eyes and try to understand what some of the common building blocks are for the API design space&mdash;resulting in what I consider 22 separate building blocks:</p>

<p>As I try to do with API <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">management</a> and <a title="API integration" href="http://integration.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">integration</a>, I&rsquo;m just trying understand what these providers offer, and how it is helping API developers be more successful in designing quality APIs. This isn&rsquo;t meant to be a perfect list, and if there are any building blocks you feel should be present, let me know.</p>
<p>You can follow my <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/">research in API design over at the Github repository</a> I&rsquo;m publishing everything to when it is ready. Like other areas of my research my goal is to produce a final white paper, while keeping the Github research repository a living store of API design information for the community.</p>

<p>As we gear up for <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/index.php">API Strategy &amp; Practice in Amsterdam, March 24-26th</a>, I&rsquo;m spending my time getting to know API companies across Europe. I published a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/27/apis-coming-out-of-the-united-kingdom/">listing of APIs I found from the United Kingdom</a> a few days ago, and next up is taking a look at what APIs are coming out of the Netherlands.</p>
<p>You tend to not think of what country an API is from, unless its attached to public infrastructure, or a company is extremely vocal about their home country. I confess that I couldn&rsquo;t name a single API from Amsterdam before this week, but now I notice that Distimo, Drillster, ElasticSearch, Peerreach, and TwitterCounter were all out of the Netherlands, and were APIs I am already familiar with.</p>
<p>I was able to easily find 17 separate APIs out of the Netherlands:</p>

<p>The educational system in the Netherlands is complex, and many public bodies are tasked with keeping schools and students on the right track. However, data regarding this task is made available to the general public in a way it is not easily processable, which makes checks by the public (and press) more difficult. The OpenOnderwijs API alleviates this problem by providing a unified interface to data on education collected from several institutions with different responsibilities with regard to the Dutch educational system, such as DUO, Onderwijsinspectie and Vensters voor Verantwoording. The OpenOnderwijs API is built on open source technology, such as Scrapy for scraping school data (the scrapers can be found at Github), Sphinx for the documentation, and ElasticSearch for efficient data storage and retrieval. Also, all school addresses are geocoded using the BAG42 service, an Dutch initiative aiming to integrate high quality, official data sources with &ldquo;regular&rdquo; geocoding.</p>

<p><span>I&rsquo;m working with the&nbsp;</span><a title="Cashtie API" href="http://bit.ly/1grzE1H">Cashtie API</a><span>&nbsp;to pull together an API evangelism strategy for the payments API. As I pull together, it seems like a great opportunity to share with you. Who knows, maybe you can use some of the elements in your own API strategy.</span></p>
<p>Next up is what I call <em>"landscape analysis"</em>, which is about monitoring the blogs, and other social network activity of the sector(s) you are evangelizing your API within:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Competition Monitoring -</strong> Evaluation of regular the activity of competitors, visiting their sites, and getting to know their customers.</li>
<li><strong>Industry Monitoring -</strong> Evaluation of relevant topics and trends of overall industry, industries that you are evangelizing within.</li>
<li><strong>Keywords -</strong> Established a list of keywords to use when searching for topics at search engines, QA, forums, social bookmarking and social networks&mdash;this should dovetail nicely into any SEO work your doing. You are doing SEO work?</li>
<li><strong>City and Country Targeting -</strong> Target specific markets with your evangelism. Get to know where your existing developers and target developers reside, and get local--be on the ground.</li>
<li><strong>Social Media Monitoring - </strong>Have a solid strategy and platform for pulling relevant data from Twitter accounts, #hashtag conversations, Github profiles, and other relevant platforms to use in your landscape analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p>The "landscape", is the space you are looking at each and every day out your virtual window, as well as what your existing and target developers will see each day. It is your job as an evangelist or advocate to know this space well, understand all the elements of the landscape, key players, relationships, and be a contributing member to this landscape.</p>
<p>Lanscape analysis should be something you do every day, weaving it into your regular social media, and other online activities. Remember you aren&rsquo;t targeting this landscape of companies and users, you are looking to participate in the conversation, while also bring your API resources to the table.</p>

<p>I am preparing a job description for an API evangelist position at the <a href="http://bit.ly/1grzE1H">Cashtie API</a>, something I do for companies from time to time. When working on a new one, I go out and look at current API evangelist job positions, to see what is new and noteworthy since last time I did it.</p>
<p>While doing this today, I came across a <a href="http://jobs.akamai.com/job/Cambridge-API-Evangelist-Job-MA-02138/45263300/">posting for API Evangelist at Akamai</a>, and while&nbsp;reading, two lines really stood out:</p>
<blockquote><em>As an API Evangelist, you are a thoughtful voice that represents a new developer mode of interaction, both inside and outside the company.</em></blockquote>
<blockquote><em>You will spread awareness of and encourage participation in our emerging API program to mold the future of our entire developer experience.</em></blockquote>
<p>Both of these lines reflect what any company should be looking for in their API evangelist. I really like the use of &ldquo;thoughtful voice&rdquo;, &ldquo;spread awareness&rdquo; and &ldquo;encourage participation&rdquo; and talking about how important the role is to the future of a company's &ldquo;entire developer experience&rdquo;.</p>
<p>When crafting your own role description for an API evangelist, make sure you spend some time looking through other companies job postings and see what details are most important to you.</p>

<p>I spend a lot of time thinking about the politics of APIs, which in my opinion is the soul of the API economy. There are numerous things that go into the politics of an API, including your terms of service (TOS), privacy policy all the way to sharing your security strategy and communicating with your developers.</p>
<p>The politics of APIs is all about the balance you take in your API operations, and how open, public, secure, transparent, accessible, and real you are in your overall approach. The politics of an API can reveal a lot about the company behind the resource, and will play a big role in how successful an API will ultimately be with the developer community.</p>
<p>Every once in a while I stumble across a new building block being used by a company, that I think is worthy of being added to my master list. This weekend I found a new one from the <a href="https://www.flowdock.com">chat &amp; inbox API Flowdock</a>&mdash;the &ldquo;thanks" page. Usually in the footer of an API developer site you will find links to an APIs terms of use, privacy policy, security and the other political building blocks of an API. Flowdock has all of this, but also has a new one&mdash;simply, <a href="https://www.flowdock.com/thanks">thanks</a>.</p>
<p>On their <a href="https://www.flowdock.com/thanks">&ldquo;thanks&rdquo; page</a>, Flowdock highlights &ldquo;the tools we use to create the best real-time teamwork environment possible&rdquo;, and says:</p>
<blockquote><em>Flowdock wouldn't be possible without some fine open-source software projects. These are some of the components we rely on, and we'd like to extend our thanks to all the authors</em></blockquote>
<p>Flowdock is right, we all depend on open-source software to make our increasingly API driven world go around. Whether it's the language(s) we program in, server OS, database platform, or the code libraries we use for API integration, open source software is an essential element of the API economy.</p>
<p>I think we all recognize this, and some of us talk about it publicly, and even fewer actively support the open source projects they depend on, but I don&rsquo;t think we showcase and pay tribute to this in a formal way. I like Flowdock&rsquo;s style, and think their approach to hanging a &ldquo;thanks: page right along with their terms of use, privacy policy and security overview, pays the proper respect to which building blocks are essential in building API driven platforms.</p>

<p><span>I&rsquo;m working with the&nbsp;</span><a title="Cashtie API" href="http://bit.ly/1grzE1H">Cashtie API</a><span>&nbsp;to pull together an API evangelism strategy for the payments API. As I pull together, it seems like a great opportunity to share with you. Who knows, maybe you can use some of the elements in your own API strategy.</span></p>
<p>Next up is blogging, an area I feel is the single most important part of your API evangelism strategy:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Projects</strong> - Establishing of editorial assembly line of technical projects that can feed blog stories, how-tos, samples and code libraries.</li>
<li><strong>Stories</strong> - Writing, editing and posting of stories derived from projects, with SEO and API area support by design.</li>
<li><strong>Syndication</strong> - Syndication to Tumblr, Blogger and other relevant blogging sites that actually add value to readers, not being spammy.</li>
</ul>
<p>This part of evangelism can be as involved as you like, being the work of a lone evangelist, or the work of a team of coders, writers, editors and community managers. The goal is to generate exhaust around your API, that will attract new developers to an API, as well as educate existing developers about the value an API delivers.</p>
<p>If you aren&rsquo;t producing interesting projects around your API, and telling these stories far and wide, nobody will ever know your API exists, let alone put it to use.</p>

        <p><a href="http://raml.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/raml/raml-logo.jpg" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><span>As part of my&nbsp;</span><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/16/api-design-do-you-swagger-blueprint-or-raml/">research in the world of API design</a><span>, I&rsquo;m looking into the different approaches by API Blueprint, RAML and Swagger, to provide API definitions, services and tools that assist developers in better designing APIs. I have already look at the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/22/the-evolving-motivations-behind-api-definitions/">evolving motivations behind API definitions</a><span>, and some insight into the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/31/the-vision-behind-swagger-api-blueprint-and-raml/">vision behind Swagger, API Blueprint and RAML</a><span>, next up is taking a look at the tooling that is emerged around each approach.</span></p>
<p>I began with a look at the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/25/api-design-tooling-from-swagger/">tooling around Swagger</a>, then I laid out what is <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/27/api-design-tooling-from-api-blueprint/">offered around API Blueprint</a>, from Apiary.io&mdash;next up, <a href="http://raml.org/">RAML</a> which is developed by <a href="http://www.mulesoft.com/">Mulesoft</a>, and reflects the evolution of the API design space, making it much more attractive to the enterprise.</p>
<p>Like API Blueprint, RAML is a markdown based API description format, which is an evolution from the XML of WADL, and the JSON of Swagger. I think this approach to defining APIs has significance when exposing API design beyond the developers community, but only time will tell.</p>
<p>Everything RAML centers around the RESTful API Modeling Language:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/raml-org/raml-spec">RESTful API Modeling Language (RAML) </a></strong>- A concise, expressive language for describing RESTful APIs. RAML is built on broadly used standards such as YAML and JSON and is a non-proprietary, vendor-neutral open spec.</li>
</ul>
<p>With RAML interpreters available in JS and Java:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>RAML JavaScript Parser </strong>- A reference implementation of a RAML parser for JavaScript. It's based on PyYAML, written in CoffeeScript, and can be used as a node.js module or in-browser. It is compliant with RAML 0.8, and provided under an Apache 2.0 license.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>RAML Java Parser -</strong> A reference implementation of a RAML parser for Java. It's based on SnakeYAML, and written in Java. It can be added as a Java library into a project directly or through Apache Maven. It is compliant with RAML 0.8, and provided under an Apache 2.0 license.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond the RAML interpreter you start seeing some pretty sophisticated tooling for the API design process emerge:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API Designer </strong>- A web-based API development tool that allows API providers to design their API quickly, efficiently, and consistently, and socialize the design. It consists of a RAML editor side-by-side with an embedded RAML console (the API Console). It is provided under the open-source CPAL license.&nbsp; </li>
<li><strong>API Console - </strong>A graphical user interface for a RAML-defined API that visually exposes the API&rsquo;s structure and important patterns and serves as interactive API documentation. It is provided under the open-source CPAL license.&nbsp; </li>
<li><strong>API Notebook - </strong>A web-based, persistent, JavaScript scripting workspace that enables live testing and exploring of APIs, and saving API use cases as markdown gists, so they are versioned, forkable and shareable. It's an example of literate programming. It is provided under the open-source CPAL license.</li>
</ul>
<p>These API design tools reflect the open enterprise  approach to software development from Mulesoft, but there is also other tooling emerging from within the RAML community:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SoapUI RAML Plugin - </strong>SoapUI is a very popular functional testing tool, broadly used for testing APIs. It supports not only SOAP but also REST and any other HTTP APIs, as well as JMS, AMF and JDBC. The RAML plugin for SoapUI allows importing RAML descriptions of APIs into SoapUI to test those APIs. The plugin is provided under the open-source Apache 2.0 license.&nbsp; </li>
<li><strong>APIkit</strong> - A declarative toolkit that leverages RAML to facilitate the implementation of APIs. It uses RAML as the definition of the API, which can then be used with APIkit Maven- and Mule Studio-based tools for mocking the interface and implementing its backend using Mule flows. It is provided under the open-source CPAL license.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>RAML Store  - </strong>A simple storage API plus a persistence plugin which enables you to run the RAML API Designer locally (rather than using a cloud service) and still be able to manage and collaborate on your design. The service is built with node.js, using express and mongodb.&nbsp; </li>
<li><strong>JAX-RS Codegen -</strong> A set of Java tools that support an API-first approach to implementing RAML-described RESTful services in Java with JAX-RS. Given a RAML specification of an API, it generates corresponding JAX-RS-annotated interfaces and supporting classes, which can be used in your project to implement those spec-compliant APIs. This project is in early alpha. It is provided under the open-source Apache 2.0 license.&nbsp; </li>
<li><strong>RAML Sublime Plugin - </strong>This is a simple syntax highlighter for Sublime that provides support for the RESTful API Modeling Language (http://raml.org/). It is provided under the open-source Apache 2.0 license.</li>
</ul>
<p>When reviewing the tooling for RAML, you can tell some serious planning has gone into it. Wordnik was developing open tooling based upon their immediate needs, and Swagger just happened, with API Blueprint being designed to match the API design workflow of Apiary. Mulesoft obviously had time to put a plan together when it came to RAML, based upon what they already saw occurring in the space, and their own experience.</p>
<p>When it comes to tools that facilitates the API design process, RAML is definitely the leader. However Swagger and API Blueprint definitely enjoy a first mover lead in the world of delivering API design services. I&rsquo;m not convinced a first mover advantagee, or a suite of well designed tooling will be more valuable to developers&mdash;I will play with actually designing and deploying each platform next, to see what I learn by actually using Swagger, API Blueprint and RAML to design a basic API.</p>

        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/europe11.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was able to update my API monitoring system to include the location of some of the APIs, allowing me to look at APIs by country and region. In preparation for <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/index.php">API Strategy &amp; Practice in Amsterdam</a>, I'm taking a closer look at what API innovation is coming out of Europe--first up the United Kindom.</p>
<p>I knew about some of the APIs like Datasift and The Guardian, but I enjoyed learning about the other 35 API companies that I discovered. I was only able to find the location of about 700 of the over 2000 API companies that I track on, but will continue to update the rest of the APIs as I can.</p>

<p>GoSquared helps you understand and improve your online presence. GoSquared creates two web applications for monitoring your website&rsquo;s traffic in real-time - Dashboard and Trends. Dashboard is a real-time traffic monitoring app that gives you an overview of your website&rsquo;s traffic right now - in a single glance. It lets you see which pages of your site are most popular, where your visitors are coming from, and info on every visitor currently browsing your website along with how they&rsquo;re browsing (what browser, operating system, screen size, etc.), which language they&rsquo;re speaking, and what city they&rsquo;re from. Dashboard doesn&rsquo;t just tell you who&rsquo;s on your site, it also knows what page they&rsquo;re on, and what pages they&rsquo;ve been on. It know&rsquo;s where they&rsquo;ve come from (Twitter, Digg, Google, etc.) making it easy to see when someone&rsquo;s talking about you. Trends takes all the data in Dashboard and builds beautiful, easy to read charts and tables so that you can analyse how your website has been performing over the past day, week, month, or year. Trends enables you to gain insights into your website&rsquo;s traffic data quicker than ever before - without having to click a single button.</p>

        <span class="post-date">27 Feb 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://apiblueprint.org/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/apiblueprint/apiblueprint-logo-2.png" alt="" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><span>As part of my&nbsp;</span><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/16/api-design-do-you-swagger-blueprint-or-raml/">research in the world of API design</a><span>, I&rsquo;m looking into the different approaches by API Blueprint, RAML and Swagger, to provide API definitions, services and tools that assist developers in better designing APIs. I have already look at the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/22/the-evolving-motivations-behind-api-definitions/">evolving motivations behind API definitions</a><span>, and some insight into the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/31/the-vision-behind-swagger-api-blueprint-and-raml/">vision behind Swagger, API Blueprint and RAML</a>, next up is taking a look at the tooling that is emerged around each approach.</p>
<p>I began with a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/25/api-design-tooling-from-swagger/">look at the tooling around Swagger</a>, and next up is to look at <a href="http://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>, from <a href="http://apiary.io/">Apiary.io</a>,&nbsp;which is centered around a markdown based API definition language:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="http://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a> -</strong> Apiary.io&rsquo;s API definition language designed to allow anyone, not just developers to design APIs</li>
</ul>
<p>To put API Blueprint to use, Apiary provides a parser:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/apiaryio/snowcrash">Snowcrash</a> -</strong> The API Blueprint parser built on top of the Sundown Markdown parser</li>
</ul>
<p>When it comes to tooling around API Blueprint, it is all about the Apiary.io platform:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Apiary.io -</strong> Collaborative design, instant API mock, generated documentation, integrated code samples, debugging and automated testing</li>
</ul>
<p>Apiary.io delivers the features we are seeing emerge around Swagger and RAML, and more:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Server Mock - </strong>Providing a mock API interface allowing you to experiment with an API interface before you write any code</li>
<li><strong>Interactive Documentation </strong>- Auto generated API documentation that allows developers to authenticate and make live calls to an API while learning the documentation</li>
<li><strong>GitHub Sync -</strong> Apiary uses Github to store each API Blueprint, allowing it to be stored publicly or privately on Github, with automatic updating of API docs with each Github commit</li>
<li><strong>Command Line Tools -</strong> A separate command-line interface available as ruby gem, allowing for the automation and integration of API Blueprints it your regular workflow</li>
<li><strong>Traffic Inspector -</strong> Providing a proxy to run API calls through allowing the breakdown of each call to APIs, helping developers understand and debug APIs much easier</li>
<li><strong>Discussion</strong> - Communication tools within API blueprint documentation allowing team and public developer conversations</li>
</ul>
<p>I did find two other open tools for API Blueprint:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/apiaryio/gavel">HTTP Call Validator</a></strong> - Gavel is a tool for deciding which HTTP API call is valid and which is not</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/apiaryio/dredd">API Blueprint Testing Tool</a> </strong>- Dredd is a command-line tool for testing API documentation written in API Blueprint format against its backend implementation.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;d say that Apiary with API Blueprint was the first company dedicated specifically to API design. Swagger was born as a set of tools out of Wordnik, and not designed to be a product, with RAML coming later.  While Swagger was pushing API design into new areas beyond just interactive docs, Apiary and API Blueprint was the first API design only startup to emerge.</p>
<p>During 2006-2012, API management was being standardized by pioneers like Mashery, 3Scale and Apigee--now API design is now being defined by providers like Swagger, &nbsp;API Blueprint, and RAML. It shows that the API space is continueing to expand and mature, increasing the need to refine not just API design, but the overall API lifecycle.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>I&rsquo;m working with the&nbsp;</span><a title="Cashtie API" href="http://bit.ly/1grzE1H">Cashtie API</a><span>&nbsp;to pull together an API evangelism strategy for the payments API. As I pull together, it seems like a great opportunity to share with you. Who knows, maybe you can use some of the elements in your own API strategy.</span></p>
<p>Next up is developer engagement, and focusing on the ways you reach out to API consumers. You don&rsquo;t need to describe every way you are going to engage with developers, but you should make sure and pick a handful of channels and stick with them, regularly reaching out to developers, providing a communication platform they can depend on.</p>
<p>There are some proven approaches to developer outreach:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Fresh Engagement -</strong> Emailing new developers who have registered to see what their immediate needs are, while their registration is fresh in their minds</li>
<li><strong>Active User Engagement -</strong> Reaching out to existing, active users of an API and find out what they need. Profile them, including Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and pull any profile information, then grade and categorize each developer</li>
<li><strong>Historical Engagement -</strong> Emailing historical active and / or inactive developers to engage and understand what their needs are and would make them active or increase activity, consider newsletter or personalized emails when appropriate</li>
<li><strong>Social Engagement - </strong>When emailing any developer, using Rapportive you can establish any URL, Twitter, Facebook or LinkedIn profile they have and reach out via these networks</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many other ways to reach out to developers, but you should have a regular rhythm for reaching out to new developers, existing developers will re-enforce relationships with your developers consistently through the channels that make the most sense.</p>
<p>If developers know they will get regularly information from you via a newsletter, and that you are accessible via common social media channels, they are more likely to reach out when they need help, and have you in the back of their mind when they do encounter a problem that your API provides a solution to.</p>

        <span class="post-date">25 Feb 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://helloreverb.com/developers/swagger" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/swagger/swagger-round.png" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>As part of my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/16/api-design-do-you-swagger-blueprint-or-raml/">research in the world of API design</a>, I&rsquo;m looking into the different approaches by API Blueprint, RAML and Swagger, to provide API definitions, services and tools that assist developers in better designing APIs.  I have already look at the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/22/the-evolving-motivations-behind-api-definitions/">evolving motivations behind API definitions</a>, and some insight into the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/31/the-vision-behind-swagger-api-blueprint-and-raml/">vision behind Swagger, API Blueprint and RAML</a>, next up is take a look at the tooling that is evolving around each approach.</p>
<p>First up is <a href="https://helloreverb.com/developers/swagger" target="_blank">Swagger</a>, from the folks over at <a href="https://www.wordnik.com/" target="_blank">Wordnik</a>. I would consider Swagger the first mover in this new world of API design, with the Wordnik team&rsquo;s approach centered around a JSON based API definition:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="Swagger Core" href="https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core">Swagger Core</a></strong> - A JSON based API definition format, which allows for the description of  REST APIs</li>
</ul>
<p>Around the Swagger core the Wordnik team developed a core set of tooling that met their immediate needs for the Wordnik API:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="Swagger CodeGen" href="https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-codegen">Swagger CodeGen</a></strong> - A template-driven engine to generate client code in different languages by parsing a Swagger Core definition</li>
<li><strong><a title="Swagger UI" href="https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-ui">Swagger UI</a></strong> - A dependency-free collection of HTML, Javascript, and CSS assets that dynamically generate beautiful documentation from a Swagger defined API</li>
</ul>
<p>Secondarily other more specific tools have emerged:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="Swagger JS" href="https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-js">Swagger JS</a></strong> - Javascript library to connect to swagger-enabled APIs via browser or nodejs</li>
<li><strong><a title="Swagger Node Express" href="https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-node-express">Swagger Node Express</a></strong> - Swagger module for node.js w/express module</li>
<li><strong><a title="Swagger Socket" href="https://github.com/wordnik/swaggersocket">Swagger Socket</a></strong> - A REST over WebSocket</li>
<li><strong><a title="Swagger Play 2" href="https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core/tree/master/modules/swagger-play2">Swagger Play 2</a></strong> - Provides automatically-generated Swagger JSON for the Play! framework</li>
</ul>
<p>Swagger was born out of Wordnik&rsquo;s desire for interactive documentation, but evolved into tooling for generating server and client side code, and has ended up providing a central language for facilitating discussions around API design, deployment and integration in many other areas.</p>
<p>I know there are some other tools available out there for Swagger, this just represents would I could find easily off their Github account. If there are other Swagger tools you know of, let me know and I&rsquo;m happy to add to this post and my research.</p>

<p>It can be pretty difficult to explain exactly what an API does to the average person. Some people think of APIs being associated with databases, where others think they are always attached to online applications like Facebook or Twitter.  Then there are so many types of APIs, where do you start, when someone asks what is an API?</p>
<p>To help people understand APIs, it is best to move away from the technical explanation and get closer to the actual problem being solved by your API. Example, a new API I&rsquo;m working with called the <a href="http://bit.ly/1grzE1H" target="_blank">Cashtie API</a> lets you generate barcodes that can be scanned from mobile phones at the point of sale (POS) systems at major retailers&mdash;a technical explanation</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about a problem. Anyone selling a product or service (online or offline) would love to have their product in major retailers like Walmart, Target and CVS. The problem is how do you get your product into these stores? In this case, the solution is the Cashtie API, which allows mobile application developers to generate the barcodes that allow your customers to pay cash for products and services, or pay their bills at these retail locations.</p>
<p>It can be easy to think of your API in a technical sense, especially if you are the geek who developed it. What is really important, is that you think of it terms of providing solutions to actual problems businesses are facing. If you think of your API in these terms, and can easily articulate to any random person the value it delivers, there is a much greater chance your API will be put to use.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/02/24/the-importance-of-a-government-api-phase/">The Importance Of A Government API Phase</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">24 Feb 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-government.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m stepping back and trying to understand more about where we are at in the <a href="http://history.apievangelist.com/">history of APIs</a>. Looking at the API space in terms of our past, provides me with a healthier understanding of where we are currently, and where things are possibly headed. I tend to not get blinded by the shiny new technology that surrounds us, hopefuly allowing me to see a bigger picture.</p>
<p>I just wrote about how I feel we are in what I would call the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/17/what-is-the-next-phase-of-apis/">enterprise phase of APIs</a>, where large companies, not just tech startups are seeing the benefit of web APIs. I think there will still be lots of innovation from startups, but to take the API economy to the level, where it is truly part of the global economy, the enterprise has to get on the train.</p>
<p>These phases of API evolution don&rsquo;t happen one after another, they overlap, with commerce, social, cloud and mobile all feeding into what is attracting large global enterprises to APIs, while all these sectors also need the enterprise to get on board--everything is interconnected. As with the enterprise layer of the API economy, I think the recent increased government awareness of APIs, is just as significant as the attention we are seeing from the enterprise.</p>
<p>While writing my post about the the enterprise phase, I noticed that I&rsquo;m speaking with just as many federal agencies as I have been from the enterprise. I can&rsquo;t help but look at this movement in government alongside the big moves from the enterprise. Many folks aren&rsquo;t seeing the movement they&rsquo;d like to from our government when it comes to APIs, but even though things aren't perfect, we are seeing big movement from all levels of government when it comes to open data and API, with over 75 federal agencies deploying APIs.</p>
<p>In the last month, I&rsquo;ve talked to numerous federal agencies about their API strategies, beyond just open data&mdash;I mean census, regulatory, patent, education, healthcare and other commerce stimulating aspects of our federal government, the big stuff. Thanks to the hard work of many open data and API savvy tech folks, the word is out across all levels of government, and people are asking for APIs. Citizens, leaders, other agencies, and even other countries are asking for simple web API access to our vital public resources, and the government is having to step it up.</p>
<p>Much like the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/17/what-is-the-next-phase-of-apis/">enterprise phase I described last week</a> needed social, cloud and mobile to make APIs work for the enterprise, I think it all will also depend on government having viable APIs. Much like our legacy economy, government and business work in concert, feeding each other&mdash;the API economy will be driven by not just the innovation of startups, and the global resources of the enterprise, it will depend on our government being machine readable by default.</p>
<p>Businesses will need to be able to efficiently monitor regulations, file and pay taxes, navigate the world of patents, and not just when they are required to interact with government&mdash;businesses need to be able to obtain resources from government in a frictionless, and beneficial way. Individuals will need to be able to apply for loans, file and pay taxes, and engage with government via their mobile devices and laptops--APIs will faciliate all of this.</p>
<p>When it come to the API economy, I am always stating that we can&rsquo;t just look at the technology of APIs, we have to look at the business and politics of APIs. As we try to understand where we are at, and where we are going, we have to look beyond the tech, understand that we not just need the enterprise on board, we also need the government to be up to speed on APIs, otherwise the rest of the space will suffer, and the API economy will sputter along, never quite achieving its full potential.</p>

<p>While looking through hundreds of blogs from API providers, one practice that I&rsquo;m seeing more of is companies showcasing their own use of their API. Some of you may think this is obvious, but I think a lot of companies are using their own API and never tell the story about how they are using their own services&mdash;I mean if your API is so great, demonstrate to people why it is so kick ass.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t just say dumb shit like we eat our own dog food, show us how, where and why you use it. Prove to us that you use the same APIs that you are delivering to external developers. Are you using to drive your website? mobile devices? partner integrations? Let us know the details about how it was designed, deployed and the challenges you face in not just managing but also integrating it with your apps.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you are using your APIs in some pretty cool ways internally, but if you don&rsquo;t tell the story to your external partners and developers, they will never know how cool your APIs really are. You never know, one of your stories might convince one of them to use your APIs as well.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/02/24/landscape-targeting-payment-apis/">Landscape Targeting: Payment APIs</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">24 Feb 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-target.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>When I want to understand a business sector as part of my overall analysis, or part of a specific API strategy, I kick off what I call a <strong><em>&ldquo;landscape targeting&rdquo;</em></strong> campaign. This time around I am interested in better understanding the the landscape of the payment API space.</p>
<p>Every landscape targeting campaign begins with some Googling of the top key phrase, which this time is <em>"payment API"</em>. From this I manually build a list of key players in the payment API space. My goal is to not build a complete list, but a list of the players doing it well&mdash;screw the rest. I only have time to target the best approaches, and in the payment space I find roughly 35 players, which I will publish later.</p>
<p>While I am conducting this same procedure on all 35 payment companies, I start with the one I know the best, and feel will produce the most meaningful results&mdash;<a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a>. To help me quantify Stripe&rsquo;s ecosystem landscape I execute the following:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Pull a Twitter profile for @Stripe, which gives me a snapshot of their Twitter account, via the Twitter API</li>
<li>Pull lists of @Stripe Twitter followers and friends Twitter IDs using the Twitter API</li>
<li>Pull a Twitter profile for the followers and friends of @Stripe, so I have each of their names, bios, location, and friend / follower count</li>
<li>Pull a Github profile for Stripe, which gives me a snapshot of their Github account, with overall activity, via the Github API</li>
<li>Pull a list of all Stripe repositories using the Github API</li>
<li>Pull a list of each repositories watchers, subscribers and contributors using the Github API</li>
<li>Pull each of those repo watchers, subscribers and contributors Github profiles using the Github API</li>
<li>Profile each Twitter follower using <a href="http://www.fullcontact.com/developer/">Full Contact API</a> to obtain their alternate Github or LinkedIn profile</li>
<li>Profile each Github user that shared their email address using Full Contact API to obtain their alternate Twitter or LinkedIn profile</li>
</ul>
<p>For Stripe, I ended up with 21K Twitter users, 30 repositories and over 5K Github users. &nbsp;You have 25K individuals and companies potentially depending on Stripe for payment API services. Of course a lot of these profiles will be useless, but once again I&rsquo;m looking for the cream on top of this landscape targeting&mdash;I don't have time to look at all details.</p>
<p>Multiple this by 35, and you have a pretty interesting definition of the payment API landscape. This is where the hard work begins. You need to sift through all of this data, find blogs, interesting tweets, leading companies, active developers, and any other gems that will potentially shine within the payment API landscape. I will spend next couple weeks refining, tagging and curating, and will continue in real-time as my research continues.</p>
<p>This approach is derived from what I've been doing to quantify the API space for the last 4 years, and also executing against other sectors like <a href="http://baas.apievangelist.com/">Baas</a>, Real-time, etc. My goal is to help me understand each business sector, while also producing enough data and content to tell stories on API Evangelist, publish open research projects on Github, and sometimes result in an industry white paper.</p>
<p>I Just thought I&rsquo;d share some of my approaches to using APIs to better understand the landscape of specific API business sectors, and show how I don't just talk about APIs, but I actually use them regularly to produce content.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m working with Phil Legetter (<a href="https://twitter.com/leggetter">@leggetter</a>) to put together a panel at API Strategy &amp; Practice in Amsterdam on APIs and realtime, and as I&rsquo;m working to bring together the leaders from the space together, I can&rsquo;t help but think of past APIStrat panels. At APIStrat we are looking to pull together the leaders from different business sectors and have a conversation on where we are, and where things are going with trends like API aggregation, automation, design, BaaS and realtime.</p>
<p>At <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Mobile-Back-end-Service">APIStrat, NYC 203 we brought together the leaders from the backend as a service (BaaS) space,</a> including <span>Ilya Sukhar (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/ilyasu">@ilyasu</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.parse.com/" target="_blank">Parse</a><span>, Morgan Bickle (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/morganbickle">@morganbickle</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.kinvey.com/" target="_blank">Kinvey</a><span>, Marc Weil (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/marcweil">@marcweil</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://cloudmine.me/" target="_blank">Cloudmine</a><span>, Miko Matasumura (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/mikojava">@mikojava</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="http://kii.com/" target="_blank">Kii</a><span>, Ty Amell (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/tyamell">@tyamell</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.stackmob.com/" target="_blank">StackMob</a><span>&nbsp;James Tamplin (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/jamestamplin">@jamestamplin</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.firebase.com/" target="_blank">Firebase</a>, resulting in a pretty interesting discuss about what is BaaS, and the future of the fast growing trend in using APIs for mobile development.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to March of 2014, Parse has been acquired by Facebook, Stackmob acquired by Paypal and shut-down just last week, and the speed at which the tech sector moves is really evident. I started tracking on BaaS in 2011, and just 3 years later the space has evolved fast&mdash;making conversations like the APIStrat BaaS panel critical in helping shape the industry.</p>
<p>As APIs + realtime technologies gain in popularity amongst startups and leading tech companies, its time to get together and have a conversation with leading tech companies in the realtime space like <a href="http://pusher.com/">Pusher</a>, <a href="http://www.pubnub.com/">Pubnub</a>, <a href="https://www.firebase.com/">Firebase</a>, and <a href="https://fanout.io/">Fanout.io</a> to name a few. Much like BaaS, the important conversations around key trends in API like realtime, will be occurring at APIStrat.</p>
<p>These conversations are why the <a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale</a> team and API Evangelist put on #APIStrat, and look forward to you being part of these important discussions. Make sure you are <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/index.php">registered for API Strategy &amp; Practice in Amsterdam, March 26-28th</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m working with the <a title="Cashtie API" href="http://bit.ly/1grzE1H">Cashtie API</a> to pull together API evangelism strategy for the payments API. As I pull together it seems like a great opportunity to share with you. Who knows, maybe you can use some of the elements in your own API strategy.</p>
<p>First up, is goals. What are the goals of your API initiative?</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Increase Awareness of API Program</strong> - The number one priority for any API, increase awareness that you even exist!</li>
<li><strong>Growth in New Users </strong>- Everyone wants new registrations for the API--it s a great goal, but don&rsquo;t get too caught up in just acquiring new users.</li>
<li><strong>Growth in Existing User API Usage -</strong> How do we encourage existing users to consume more, be more successful in using API resources.</li>
<li><strong>Brand Awareness -</strong> Elevate the awareness of not just an API but the overall company brand(s), establishing life long customers.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few initial goals every company should consider when crafting an API evangelism campaign, but don&rsquo;t stop there, what are some other goals?</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>New Customers For Other Products -</strong> Do you have other products and services you&rsquo;d like your API end-users to be aware of?</li>
<li><strong>Value Add For Existing Customers - </strong>Maybe you have an existing customer base you want to encourage development of products, services and features that add value to their existing engagement.</li>
<li><strong>Revenue</strong> - Money, of course, we all need to make money. How do we leverage API resources into new sources of revenue for our company?</li>
</ul>
<p>Having short term, and long term goals is essential to any API evangelism strategy. What are our long term goals? What goals do we have this week? How do they change over time? Documenting our goals is critical, so we can deliver on them, but also understand how we need to shift our goals to be more successful over time.</p>
<p>Do you have goals for your API program that aren't listed here? Share them with me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane">@kinlane</a> with hashtag #apigoals.</p>

<p>I've been polishing my version of the <a href="http://history.apievangelist.com/">history of web APIs</a> since I started API Evangelist. Through my research it became clear that the world of web APIs had evolved through several key phases that have gotten us to where we are at, and were essential in making the API economy a viable opportunity. So far my history tracks on 5 key phases:</p>

<li><strong>Commerce</strong> - The first wave of web apis came from commerce pioneers like Salesforce, eBay and Amazon deploying APIs to make commerce more distributed.</li>
<li><strong>Social</strong> - Early pioneers like Flickr, Delicious, Facebook and Twitter have made the Internet social by default using web APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Business</strong> - As APIs evolved API management providers like Mashery, 3Scale and Apigee have standardized the business approach of leading APIs, delivering tools and services that other API providers can put to use.</li>
<li><strong>Cloud</strong> - Amazon forever changed the way we compute using APIs, proving that we could deploy essential global infrastructure like compute, storage and DNS using web APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile</strong> - The final piece of the puzzle was the mobile computing device, ushered in by Apple with the iPhone, followed up by Google with Android, mobile phones will forever change how we interact, with APIs delivering the essential resources we need to make mobile possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>In my opinion, the 2014 API economy wouldn't be possible if APIs hadn&rsquo;t developed and evolved through these stages. Commerce, social, business, cloud, mobile are all essential to a thriving API economy. Sure there are other APIs in other genres that fill in the cracks, but these five areas are the pillars that not only showed that APIs are viable, but will also be the pillars that the API economy rests on from here forward.</p>
<p>As I track on the API space, I&rsquo;m trying to understand where we are at, and where we are going, hoping to identify the next phases of API history. I'm keeping an eye on trends like aggregation, realtime, data, baas, reciprocity, single page apps, Internet of things (IoT), and other areas trying to understand what is next. While I think IoT is definitely the most compelling and seems to be moving the fastest, I think we need to step back, and be careful not look at this through a technological lens.</p>
<p>I identified early on that this world of APIs wasn't going to be all about the tech. From an API provider, consumer or analyst viewpoint we should not only consider the technology of APIs, and remember that the business of APIs is essential to everything that happens. While I think there will be an incredible amount of innovation from startups when it comes to API deployment in new areas like real time and reciprocity, I think one of the phases we are in the middle of right now, is the enterprise phase.</p>
<p>In the last month I've talked with more fortune 500 companies about their API strategy, than any other group, well maybe the same as government (parallel phase?). I've talked with familiar enterprise players like AT&amp;T, but have also had conversations with newer entrants like Adobe.  There is always a place for startups to innovate with APIs, pushing us into new areas, but it is going to take the resources of the fortune 500 to truly make the API economy a reality when it comes to the global economy.</p>
<p>As I see it, all the phases I&rdquo;ve described don&rsquo;t happen one after another, they overlap and feed off each other, and much like we couldn't fully realize the potential of commerce, without cloud computing and mobile--I don't think the API economy will fully be realized until major companies have a solid API program, and working API strategy. As with other phases of API development, this won't all be good, I think there is a lot to be worked out at the city, state and federal level government levels, and important issues around the politics of APIs are growing more critical every day, but I still think the current shift by the enterprise towards APIs will be seen as a significant phase in the history of APIs, when we look back.</p>

<p>At <a title="API Strategy &amp; Practice" href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/">API Strategy &amp; Practice</a> in San Francisco last October, we streamed the event online. We are considering doing this again for <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/index.php" target="_blank">#APIStrat in Amsterdam this March 26-28th</a>.</p>
<p>We had an inquiry from Australia, asking whether or not we planned to do this for Amsterdam, and they wanted to stream some of the event as part of their local API meetup--what a great idea!</p>
<p>So we wanted to put out the word and see if there are other API meetup groups that were interested in doing the same thing in their local area. If you are interested in streaming the event go ahead and ping me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane">@kinlane</a> or email me at <a title="info@apievangelist.com" href="mailto:info@apievangelist.com">info@apievangelist.com</a>.</p>
<p>If we get enough groups signed up, we&rsquo;ll make sure the stream is available for Amsterdam.</p>

        <span class="post-date">14 Feb 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://baas.apievangelist.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/trends/baas-trends.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been <a href="http://baas.apievangelist.com/">tracking on BaaS since 2011</a>, and identified it was an important layer of the API space, dedicated to serving up the resources that mobile developers were needing to be successful.  BaaS is all about creating meaningful stacks of API driven resources, allowing developers to build on top of a single backend, and not have to assemble their own from disparate open source tools, cloud service and individual API providers.</p>
<p>During 2012 I saw the momentum picking up around BaaS and made sure I included it in my monitoring of the API space, resulting in a <a href="https://gum.co/ngAa">BaaS white paper</a>, which I will be updating for 2014 to include recent shifts towards the enterprise. In February 2013, <a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale</a> and API Evangelist also brought together <span>Ilya Sukhar (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/ilyasu">@ilyasu</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.parse.com/" target="_blank">Parse</a><span>, Morgan Bickle (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/morganbickle">@morganbickle</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.kinvey.com/" target="_blank">Kinvey</a><span>, Marc Weil (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/marcweil">@marcweil</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://cloudmine.me/" target="_blank">Cloudmine</a><span>, Miko Matasumura (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/mikojava">@mikojava</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="http://kii.com/" target="_blank">Kii</a><span>, Ty Amell (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/tyamell">@tyamell</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.stackmob.com/" target="_blank">StackMob</a><span>&nbsp;James Tamplin (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/jamestamplin">@jamestamplin</a><span>) of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.firebase.com/" target="_blank">Firebase</a> to talk about the fast growing BaaS space at <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2013NYC/">API Strategy &amp; Practice in NYC</a>&mdash;resulting in a pretty heated exchange between Ilya and Tye, which is ironic since these were the two acquisitions we saw in 2013 (<a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Mobile-Back-end-Service">which I alluded to at the closing of the panel, but you will have to watch for yourself</a>).</p>
<p>Here we are in 2014, <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2013/04/25/welcoming-parse-to-facebook/">Parse has been acquired by Facebook</a>, and <a href="https://www.paypal-forward.com/leadership/paypal-welcomes-the-stackmob-team/">Stackmob has been acquired by Paypal</a>. While Parse is still functioning as a viable BaaS platform, we got the news this week that <a href="https://blog.stackmob.com/2014/02/stackmob-announcement/" target="_blank">Stackmob was shutting down as of May, no longer supporting developers</a>. I think Parse and Stackob are the poster children for amazing new resources that capture the attention of developers, and while not all of them go away when acquisitions occur, it is something developers have become all to familiar with, and need to build in their own operational plans.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we can blame Stackmob for their decision, I&rsquo;m sure many of you entrepreneurs will be faced with the same decision when you reach your goal of acquisition, I don&rsquo;t think every exit will be as positive as Parse&rsquo;s was with Facebook&mdash;which seems more of a partnership than acquisition. I asked Sravish Sridhar (<a href="https://twitter.com/sravish">@sravish</a>), CEO of Kinvey to get his thoughts on the recent announcement from Stackmob:</p>
<blockquote><em>&ldquo;..all the initial BaaS vendors built compelling platforms with very useful features for mobile developers, however it's very difficult to create a sustainable and long-term business by just solving Backend issues for individual developers, especially with just Series-A funding, the market to build a business is with the enterprise. Those that couldn't make the transition have since been acquired. Now companies like Kinvey, AnyPresence and FeedHenry are maturing in the enterprise market.&rdquo;</em></blockquote>
<p>This future of BaaS providers is pretty clear to me, with Kinvey&rsquo;s latest move to launch a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/02/13/kinvey-launches-dedicated-backend-as-a-service-platform-for-enterprise-developers" target="_blank">dedicated backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platform for enterprise developers</a>. While we all have hopes that the world of open development will provide enough revenue to support the release of the best products and services, the money is with the enterprise&mdash;especially when you have accepted money from VC&rsquo;s, which is essential to delivering at scale, you will have to follow the money.</p>
<p>As with other <a href="http://apievangelist.com/trends/">trends in the API space</a> like <a title="realtime apis" href="http://realtime.apievangelist.com/">real-time</a>, <a title="api reciprocity" href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com/">reciprocity</a>, <a title="api aggregation" href="http://aggregation.apievangelist.com/">aggregation</a> and <a href="http://voice.apievangelist.com/">voice</a>, we will see lots of innovation from newcomers, but as these sectors mature, winners will emerge, losers will go away, consolidation will occur&mdash;as a developer do you have this inevitable aspect of the tech world built into your operational plans?</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/02/14/jumpstarting-the-api-conversation-using-prototypes/">Jumpstarting The API Conversation Using Prototypes</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">14 Feb 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://ed-data.github.io/fafsa-api"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/federal-government/ed/fafsa-form.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>For those of us who live and breathe APIs, it is easy to image what is possible when discussing an idea for an API, or what an API could to to transform an existing process or application&mdash;however for everyone else will often need something more to help them understand what is possible.  Often times it is these folks who are the decision makers behind whether an API will live or die, so it is critical to help them get up to speed.</p>
<p>In my experience there is no better way to jumpstart the conversation about what is possible around an API, than to just build a prototype, flushing out all aspect around an API resource. This is just what I recently did around the <a href="https://fafsa.ed.gov/">free financial student aid form</a>, from the Department of Education.</p>
<p>In November someone contacted me in government and told me how there had been a conversation around a potential API for the FAFSA form, but because of the usual undercurrents in government, the discussion had gone cold. My contacts in the federal government can&rsquo;t actually ask me to work on projects for free (and they didn't), but they can express their ideas of what "could be", then it is up to me if I want to help make this come true. This is one of the primary reason I left my own position in government as a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/innovationfellows/meet-the-fellows">Presidential Innovation Fellow</a>, to give me more flexibility in designing and deployment projects, and also help federal agencies kickstart API initiatives from the outside-in.</p>
<p>During November and December I worked on <a href="http://ed-data.github.io/fafsa-api/" target="_blank">a prototype for what the FAFSA API could be</a>, using my own approach to API project development, where I don&rsquo;t just design and develop the API, I tell the story of the process in real-time, publishing it all as a Github repository and site that anyone can follow, fork and put to use.  By 12/15 I had a <a href="http://ed-data.github.io/fafsa-api/docs.html">handful of API endpoints including for reading and writing the FAFSA application, available fields, rejection codes, conditional procedures and for pulling states and universities</a> to support web and mobile application development.</p>
<p>In December I went to an education data jam in Palo Alto at Stanford, and supported another virtually that was held in Cambridge at Harvard, in an effort to push the existence of my API prototype, making people aware of what I was doing.  While there is still a lot of work to be done on prototype, I needed to add the most important ingredient that doesn't have anything to do with technology&mdash;I need to start a conversation around the potential of a FAFSA API within the education community.</p>
<p>While my FAFSA API prototype didn&rsquo;t generate code and applications I would like, I did start a conversation, and the resulting discussion and awareness around it help rekindle the conversation at the Department of Education. On January 15th at an education datapalooza in Washington DC that was looking to promote innovation in improving college access, affordability and completion the <a href="http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/fact-sheet-education-datapalooza-promote-innovation-improving-college-access-aff" target="_blank">Department of Education made an announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote><em>The U.S. Department of Education will explore the use of Application Program Interfaces (APIs) as a way to help students and families access key education processes, programs, and data. The Department will issue a Request for Information (RFI) to gather ideas and feedback on potential development of APIs with key education data, programs, and frequently used forms&mdash;including the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).</em></blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not taking full credit for this, everyone who participated in the conversation deserves credit, and while my prototype may not get any more time or resources to evolve the project forward, I still feel I accomplished my goal, which was not to develop a FAFSA API, or spawn an actual API ecosystem&mdash;it was to revive the conversation with the one group that should own the API deployment, the Department of Education.</p>
<p>When it comes to the business and politics of APIs there isn&rsquo;t always a clear path to follow when designing, deploying and finding success. Sometimes you have to develop prototypes and proof of concepts and get the conversation going, get key players to the table and then things will move forward in their own way.</p>

        <span class="post-date">13 Feb 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-handshake.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I'm been so busy with work lately, I haven't been able to maintain my usual rhythm of blog posts on API Evangelist. The good news is I'm doing some interesting work that I'm able to pull stories from. This post is from a forum post I made on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/us-government-apis">US Government API forum</a> i frequent, which has some very interesting conversations about APIs in the federal government.</p>
<p>In a recent post from Brian over at <a href="http://dc3.mil/">DC3 (Defense Cyber Crime Center)</a>, an interesting question was asked:&nbsp;<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/us-government-apis/lsvsBHpPNlQ">Do US Government Web APIs Require System Interconnectivity Agreements?</a> I will let you visit the conversation and see more detail around his question, as well as some of the other responses, but here were some of my thoughts:</p>
<p><span>Web / http APIs do not fit earlier definitions of &ldquo;system interconnectivity agreements&rdquo;, which represents the technical and fundamental shift between network connections, SOAP APIs and this new world of web APIs.</span><br /><span>&nbsp;</span><br /><span>Web APIs were successful in part because of the loosely coupled nature of HTTP, leveraging a client / server and request / response. There is interconnectivity, but not the tight coupling and governance of previous network protocols and APIs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>APIs are the contract! Each API endpoint provides access to a resource, then with accompanying management building blocks, you dial in that contract.</span><br /><span>&nbsp;</span><br /><span>At the&nbsp;<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">API provider level</span></strong>, you can enforce / encourage interoperability using common web api approaches:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><strong>API Definitions&nbsp;</strong>- Machine readable API definitions like&nbsp;<a href="https://helloreverb.com/developers/swagger" target="_blank">Swagger</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://apiblueprint.org/" target="_blank">API Blueprint</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://raml.org/" target="_blank">RAML</a>&nbsp;can provide templates that enforce / encourage common blueprints that providers can follow when publishing APIs to centralized or decentralized API management platforms, establishing base contracts for interoperability, as well as underlying data models.</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Terms of Use</strong>&nbsp;- Common terms of use can be established for management, allowing provides to contract their own TOS that is tailored for specific resources, but derived from common patterns. You see this emerging in private sector with&nbsp;<a href="http://apivoice.com/2013/12/16/api-terms-of-service-wizard-from-swedish-api-license/" target="_blank">Swedish API License</a></span><span>.</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Licensing</strong>&nbsp;- Much like TOS, common licensing blueprints can be provided, allowing data and resource licensing to be tailored for resources, but pulled from existing licensing pools. Many API providers are providing a<a href="http://apivoice.com/2014/01/16/what-is-your-api-content-licensing-default/" target="_blank">&nbsp;base stack of licensing arrangements</a>&nbsp;that meet their needs as well as consumers.</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Service Level Agreements (SLA)</strong>&nbsp;- Same as TOS, service level agreements can be forged allowing API providers to meet expectations of consumers. Some SLAs are loose and some are tight, depending on goals.</span></li>
<li><strong>Security</strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;- Common tooling and practices around the security of APIs need to be established, using common approaches like API Keys, oAuth, SSO and other common standards already in use. As with API interface patterns, data models, etc, each API provider&nbsp;should not&nbsp;be allowed to bring their home brew security to the table.</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Service Composition</strong>&nbsp;- A practice referred to as &ldquo;service composition&rdquo; is a common part of all API management platforms currently available. Service composition allows API providers to build service tiers and compose products from API resources, establishing different levels of access and usage that can be designed for internal, partner or public access to resources. Ie. Service tier A allows read only access to APIs with specific rate limits, while service tier B allows read / write access with unlimited. Service composition reflects and extends the contract that an API is.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Analytics</strong>&nbsp;- Real-time metrics give API providers with living views into API registration and usage, allowing an organic view into how resources are truly being used, allowing for real-time adjustments, enforcements, and service level composition adjustments to be made. This will allow providers to respond to adverse conditions by tightening control and stimulate innovation by loosening control as needed.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>All of these provider level building blocks work in concert to standardize design, deployment and management of common API resources. They provide a common backbone that make APIs a living contract, that is flexible enough to work with many different resources and agencies, without being too rigid&mdash;providing the ability to innovate, while still establishing desired levels of governance, which will vary from agency to agency and resource to resource.</span><br /><br /><span>At the&nbsp;<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">API consumer level</span></strong>, you can enforce / encourage interoperability using common web api approaches:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><strong>Portal</strong>&nbsp;- Each API will have one or many portals where you access the APIs and supporting documentation. The availability of a portal, whether its public or private can reflect access and interoperability goals for API providers. Portal availability is the gateway to interoperability enforcement / encouragement.</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Registration</strong>&nbsp;- Even if you have access to an API resource, and it is publicly available, most APIs require registration to obtain required application keys or obtain necessary oAuth credentials. Registration can be self-service, invite only or require approval, providing all levels of enforcement / encouragement of agreements.</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Security</strong>&nbsp;- Each API provider has designated appropriate API security levels derived from a common pool of tools and standards. Consumers are guided by API provider security standards, operate within API key restrictions, oAuth identity and access restrictions, and designated service composition frameworks that are linked to security access levels. Security is not just technology, it transcends business and politics of API interoperability.</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Terms of Service</strong>&nbsp;- Every API consumer is bound by the API TOS at the point of registration, and will be legally required to agree / adhere to future changes.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Best Practices -</strong>&nbsp;Best practices provide a plain english explanation of legal TOS for all API consumers, ensuring that all API consumers truly execute on TOS that are set forth, cause you know, nobody reads TOS.</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Service Level Agreements (SLA)</strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;- Service Level Agreements can be extended to all API consumers as part of their service level composition, registration and TOS. SLAs provide necessary real-time expectations of system performance.</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Analytics</strong>&nbsp;- Real-time metrics are provided to API consumers letting them know the reality of their &nbsp;API consumption, where they exist within service level agreements, service composition, and other aspects of API interoperability and agreements.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">All the building blocks listed above provide the two-sides of the web API coin. Modern API&nbsp;initiatives&nbsp;from Amazon, Google, Twitter and thousands of other companies are proving that loosely coupled,&nbsp;modular approaches to API design, deployment and management provide a flexible, agile approach to interoperability that&nbsp;isn't&nbsp;as rigid as classic API approaches or&nbsp;networking protocols.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial;">All of these building blocks work in concert to orchestrate interoperability that protects the interest of API providers and consumers, and even 3rd party intermediaries. You even seen this approach to interoperability move from the technical, to meaningful reciprocity across providers, as&nbsp;we've&nbsp;seen with newer generation of automation providers like If This Then That and Zapier&mdash;building on legacy ETL concepts, but bringing into a new global, Internet era.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Arial;">We have to establish case studies that will shift decision makers away from more rigid approaches. Without them we&nbsp;won't&nbsp;be able to achieve the flexibility that web APIs bring, and are left&nbsp;with a heavy handed Tech + Legal governance.</span><br /><br /><span>So to directly answer your questions:</span><br /><br /><span><strong>1) Do US Gov Web APIs *require* system interconnectivity agreements?&nbsp; Which policies and conditions?&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial;">NO!<br /></span><br /><span><strong>2) Can system interconnectivity agreements be mitigated to a common agreement instead of agency-specific? (i.e.&nbsp; single information sharing agreement, and/or Acceptable Use Policies, common Terms of Service per API provider )</strong></span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial;"><br /></span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial;">YES!<br /></span><br /><span><strong>3) Which policies/guidance can be leveraged prevent the specific use of "system interconnectivity agreements" into the rest of the US Gov Web API space?</strong></span>&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>The patterns exist in private sector and are slowly emerging in government. We just need to work to identify, standardardized and establish the case studies we need to steer away from the&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;specific use of "system interconnectivity agreements".</span></div>

        <p><a href="http://info.cvscaremark.com/cvs-insights/cvs-quits" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/cvs-pharmacy/cvs_logo_large.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>At the same time I am processing the move by <a href="http://info.cvscaremark.com/cvs-insights/cvs-quits" target="_blank">CVS to stop selling tobacco products in their over 7,600 retailsstores</a>, making a commitment to being more retail healthcare, rather than just a corner drugstore&mdash;I am also wrapping my head around potential strategy and opportunities for the <a href="https://www.cashtie.com/" target="_blank">Cashtie API</a> which opens up the ability for mobile developers to accept cash payments at CVS retail locations.</p>
<p>I think CVS&rsquo;s commitment to their healthcare mission, by itself is a pretty significant move towards reinventing themselves, but adding to the news, the White House just announced that <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/02/07/leading-pharmacies-and-retailers-join-blue-button-initiative">CVS was onboard to work with standardizing patient prescription information as part of the Blue Button initiative</a>, which works to give citizens control over their healthcare data&mdash;further defining CVS as more than just a corner drugstore.</p>
<p>As the healthcare industry continues its adoption of APIs, smart-phone adoption increase, the quantified-self movement expands, and retail drugstores like CVS look to increase their relevance, I think we will see an entirely new retail healthcare landscape emerge. When you take this seismic healthcare shift and pair up with powerful API resources like the Cashtie API, which have the potential to allow the underbanked who have recently gained access to healthcare, pay their premiums with cash&mdash;we wiill see a serious shift in how healthcare is delivered, and consumed.</p>
<p>I am seeing APIs emerge in various aspects of the healthcare industry ranging from the next generation of <a href="http://www.practicefusion.com/labs-documentation/">electronic healthcare records (EHR)</a> to accessing vital <a href="https://www.eligibleapi.com/" target="_blank">health insurance information</a>, but I think the role APIs will play in  this emerging retail healthcare space will be pretty significant in changing how we consume, pay for and interact with our healthcare.  Any company that serves the healthcare industry that doesn&rsquo;t have an API, will not stay relevant in this new API driven healthcare economy.</p>

        <span class="post-date">12 Feb 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/google-plus/google-plus-hangouts.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I did a Google Hangout with the <a title="Cashtie API" href="http://bit.ly/1grzE1H">Cashtie API</a> development team this morning, which I thought was an interesting enough format to share with all of you. The Cashtie API team is a distributed team, between the corporate headquarters in Atlanta, Ukraine and Brazil. I&rsquo;m working on ways to help Cashtie with their API strategy, and wanted to get to know the team&mdash;what better way than using Google Hangout.</p>
<p>While the call started with an introduction to the team, my goal was to spend some time walking through the Cashtie API with them, showing what I see, as a newbie to the developer area. Since I am a developer, I know how easy it is to be too close to the code, and you can miss some obvious things that may confuse API developers you are targeting. I shared my desktop in the Google Hangout, then walked through what I saw on the homepage, what the on-boarding process was like, and worked my way through their developer area, discussing their approach to delivering a dashboard, account settings, support, blog, and other areas of their API strategy.</p>
<p>Alongside this walk-through I had other browser tabs open with the developer areas of Twilio, SendGrid, Gitub, and Stripe, comparing the <a title="API building blocks" href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">building blocks</a> these API leaders employ, with the building blocks the Cashtie team used. This really helps the team understand how other APIs, who potentially have more resources, and have been at this game longer, have deployed their own developer programs.</p>
<p>This type of Google Hangout is something I will do regularly with the <a title="Cashtie API" href="/admin/blog/Cashtie API">Cashtie API</a> team (maybe others), hoping to expand their horizon when it comes to API deployment, bringing them out of their developer silo. This is one of the biggest problems I encounter with API development teams as I make my evangelist rounds--developers are often entrenched with their views and practices, because they never really are forced out of their bubble. Most developers, once you help them see a larger picture, will improve their approach to delivering their APIs, developer area, setting a much better tone for API operations.</p>

<p>In the days before the Internet when you had access to a valuable business resource, you kept it to yourself as long as you possibly can, hoping to maximize the potential to your business, and limiting other businesses access to the same resource--if possible you secured some sort of exclusive deal.</p>
<p>In the age of the Internet, APIs have democratized access to extremely valuable resources, making them available to developers and businesses of all shapes and sizes. Resources like mapping from Google Maps, compute power from Amazon, and deployment of of phone numbers around the globe using Twilio, do not take millions of dollars and the negotiations of big deals, they are all accessible to anyone via web APIs.</p>
<p>Even with this wider access to resources, it doesn't mean yCou can&rsquo;t tell compelling stories about the resources your startup has, like the ability to map from anywhere in the world, unlimited scaling of server capactiy and telephone access points around the globe. If you are a savvy startup you will discover and aggregate the best of breed API resources, then build a business and application around these resources, then tell stories that impress.</p>
<p>The best example of this I&rsquo;ve seen recently is from <a href="http://www.paynearme.com/en" target="_blank">PayNearMe</a>, who has <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/02/06/cash-based-payments-network-paynearme-raises-20m-series-e-expands-via-family-dollar-partnership/">leveraged their expansion using API driven resources, resulting in the securing of 20M in funding from GSV Capital</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">
<p>Cash-Based Payments Network PayNearMe Raises $20M Series E, Expands Via Family Dollar Partnership <a href="http://t.co/gYLIC5i3Uz">http://t.co/gYLIC5i3Uz</a> via <a href="https://twitter.com/TechCrunch">@techcrunch</a></p>

<script src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
<p>The expansion to Dollar Store by PayNearMe was done via the <a href="https://www.cashtie.com/">Cashtie API</a>, which gives you access to the point of sale systems at top retailers like Target, CVS and Dollar Stores. I&rsquo;m not saying that PayNearMe secured their 20M in funding exclusively based upon their expansion using Cashtie, but it did allow them to weave it nicely into their overall story, making for a nice investment for GSV Capital.</p>
<p>The growth in the number of high value API resources that are emerging, will provide the backbone of your technical operations, providing the resources you couldn&rsquo;t possibly develop on your own, but if you craft the right story around your API driven business, you can also leverage these API driven resources to secure the funding you need to take your startup vision to the next level.</p>

<p>In 2010 I made a deal with my girlfriend Audrey Watters (<a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters">@audreywatters</a>), I&rsquo;d run the server infrastructure behind her blog <a title="Hack Education" href="http://hackeducation.com">Hack Education</a>, and she&rsquo;d help me polish my storytelling on <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>. Audrey studied folklore and storytelling as part of her masters degree, and I saw that the API space was desperately in need of some meaningful storytelling to help the fast growing space find its future&mdash;a perfect partnership!</p>
<p>The API space is full of conversations (and arguments) about the technological building blocks of the space, and saturated with pitches for the products and services across the industry, but the sector is often deficient in stories that help newbies understand APIs, and veterans grasp the big picture of where we are going. For us to understand the space as it grows, make sense of technologies like hypermedia, and evolve approaches for communicating around APIs using definitions like API Blueprint, RAML and Swagger, we need stories&mdash;not press releases, not product pitches, we need stories that we can share and retell.</p>
<p>Every once in a while you see great stories from the occasional technologist or passionate evangelist stand out from the noise, but lately I&rsquo;m seeing more API leaders step up and deliberately craft meaningful stories that help us better understand the API universe. This week I&rsquo;ve seen two great stories emerge with <a href="http://mikeschinkel.com/blog/why-rest-is-more-like-religion-than-most-technologies/">Why REST is More Like Religion than Most Technologies</a>, from Mike Schinkel (<a href="https://twitter.com/mikeschinkel">@mikeschinkel</a>), and <a href="http://apiux.com/2014/02/06/dark-matter-api-universe/">Dark Matter in the API Universe</a> by Jason Harmon (<a href="https://twitter.com/jharmn">@jharmn</a>).</p>
<p>These stories aren&rsquo;t selling you on a specific technology or product, they are helping us understand the big picture, and tell us stories that help us understand a very complex space, which spans almost every business sector. These stories are critical to helping us all make sense of the API industry, and whether we acknowledge it or not, help lead us in a better direction, and even allow us to even laugh at ourselves from time to time.</p>
<p>Thank you to the API storytellers!</p>

<p>While it may seem obvious that you should ask your API developers what they want, many times this is a simple task that can get lost in the shuffle of API deployment and management. API Evangelist is all about sharing, simple stories that keep API providers informed of the best practices of API management&mdash;today's story comes from big data platform <a href="http://www.splunk.com/">Splunk</a>.</p>
<p>Splunk is <a href="http://splunkdev.uservoice.com/forums/235348-dev-platform">actively soliciting ideas from developers on where they think Splunk should take the platform</a>, asking questions like, should we invest in SDKs for mobile devices like IOS and Android, and should we be adding a new kind of charting to the web framework? To solicit the feedback, Splunk isn&rsquo;t getting fancy, they just <a href="http://splunkdev.uservoice.com/forums/235348-dev-platform">deployed a feedback area using UserVoice</a>&mdash;allowing developers to submit their own ideas, and vote up the ideas of other developers.</p>
<p>Splunk <a href="http://blogs.splunk.com/2014/01/28/help-us-grow-the-splunk-developer-platform-with-your-ideas-and-votes/">wrote up a blog post soliciting the feedback of the Splunk community</a>, which is something that you should do on a regular basis, not just at launch of your feedback area. Any API provider should be actively engaging their community, which will not just provide valuable feedback for the roadmap, it will bring you out of your bubble, forcing you to be closer with your developer ecosystem&mdash;which I believe is one of the healthiest side effects of an API way of life.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been reviewing the recently released <a href="http://developer.marvel.com/" target="_blank">Marvel Comic API</a>, because I&rsquo;m a comic book geek, wait no, because I&rsquo;m the API Evangelist&mdash;no wait it is both. Properly reviewing an API takes time because you need to spend time in the developers area, and actually go through the motions of hacking on an API. So far I&rsquo;ve registered, spent about 15 minutes looking around the documentation, and wrote a <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/01/a-simple-honest-approach-to-getting-started-with-the-marvel-comics-api/">post on their getting started page</a>.</p>
<p>My friend Andreas Krohn (<a href="https://twitter.com/andreaskrohn">@andreaskrohn</a>) started by first reviewing the Marvel Comics API terms of use, which is the first thing any savvy developer should do, and he wrote up a great blogs post called, <a href="http://blog.dopter.se/post/75494422535/the-marvel-api-a-case-study-in-how-to-not-respect">The Marvel API - a case study in how to not respect developers</a>.  Andreas uncovers some pretty show-stopping aspects of the Marvel terms of use, &nbsp;including the fact that you can&rsquo;t generate any revenue from your applications built on the Marvel API, publish press releases about your work, and they reserve the right to take any idea you have, and keep for themselves. ;-(</p>
<p>Through a developer lens, these are pretty clear signals that an API provider is more concerned with their own interests, and don&rsquo;t care about developers success, and it is probably a good idea to steer clear of integrating with the platform. Through the lens of a major publisher who is first entering this scary new world of APIs, it starts to makes more sense.  This is why the terms of service is the single most important building block of any API--it doesn&rsquo;t matter how good your technical implementation of an API is, or how good your other building blocks like documentation are--if your TOS does not encourage innovation, developers will walk away.</p>
<p>Even with these extreme limitations placed on the TOS, I&rsquo;m still very optimistic for the Marvel API. I agree 100% with Andreas&rsquo;s analysis, but we also have to also celebrate that a major publisher like Marvel even being willing to play in the API game. I&rsquo;ve been <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/05/10/pearson-plans-api-platform-to-unlock-content/">watching Pearson iterate on their API for over three years now</a>, which reminds me that I should work with Andreas to do a deep dive on the Pearson TOS, and like the rest of us, Pearson is learning a lot along the way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that we shouldn&rsquo;t critique the API initiatives of these companies. We should! They need to hear our feedback on every aspect of API operations, especially the terms of use, but we should also celebrate that they are even willing to put their cards on the table at all. We can&rsquo;t expect companies with major brand recognition, and deep history, to change overnight. As with the rest of us, Marvel will eventually learn to open up, give more control and opportunities to developers and better understand the benefits of a more &ldquo;open&rdquo; API program.</p>

<p>One of my biggest challenges at API Evangelist is keeping content accessible for people who have just come into the API space. The most successful aspect of my site is the blog, and while I try to keep all my writing targeted outside the developer community, it can be a lot of work to jump in and get up to speed on posts that are chronological.</p>
<p>It is really important to me, that people who are just learning about the space, or weekend API warriors can find the best resources across the space, not just on my blog&mdash;this is why I&rsquo;m super stoked about the new site from 3Scale called <a title="API Alchemy" href="http://apialchemy.3scale.net/">API Alchemy</a>.</p>
<p>API Alchemy is looking to curate the best of resources from the API space, providing curated links and commentary and access to the most influential authors across the world of APIs, in an easy to discover format.</p>

        <span class="post-date">05 Feb 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-github.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>It is easy to think of <a href="http://github.com">Github</a> as a central repository for your open source code&mdash;most developers understand that. I have written before about the <a title="many ways to use Github as part of your API management strategy" href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/06/08/api-management-using-github/">many ways to use Github as part of your API management strategy</a>, but in the last few months I'm really seeing Github playing more of a central role in the overall lifecycle of an API.</p>
<p><strong>API Presence</strong><br /><a title="Github Pages" href="http://pages.github.com/"> Github Pages</a> provides a very simple way for API providers to deploy public or private portals that can be a simple or elaborate doorway for developers to learn about and engage with APIs. A company can potentially have a single or multiple API portals, targeting a variety of potential consumers. You don't need a special website for your API anymore, just fire up a Github Page and get publishing the <a title="relevant building blocks your consumers will need" href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">relevant building blocks your consumers will need</a>.</p>
<p><strong>API Definition</strong><br /> As I continue to study the world of API definitions like API Blueprint, RAML and Swagger, I'm increasingly finding API definitions published to Github, as well as employing it as a central storage for all my own API definitions. When 3Scale and API Evangelist designed <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>, we allowed the publishing of API definitions to Github to be one of the ways you can include your API definition in the commons. By publishing your API definition on Github, either publicly or privately, you can provide a central definition of your API surface area, that can be versioned, forked, downloaded, and allow for contributions from other key players in your API ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>API Services</strong><br /> During my monitoring of the API space, I came across a new API monitoring service called <a href="http://autodevbot.com/">AutoDevBot</a>, which monitors all your API endpoints, and notifies you when something goes wrong. Pretty standard feature in a <a href="http://integration.apievangelist.com/companies.html">new wave of API integration tools and services</a> I&rsquo;m seeing emerge, but what is interesting is they use Github as a central place to store the settings for the API monitoring service. AutoDevBot has you clone their settings template, make changes you need to monitor your APIs, register and fire up AutoDevBot to monitor. Seems like a pretty simple way for API service providers to engage with API providers, allowing them to manage all the configuration for API services alongside their own internal API operations.</p>
<p><strong>API Source Code</strong><br /> Using Github as a central repository for server and client side code is not new, but using it as a central source for deploying, scaling and distribution of permanent or temporary instances of an API resource across various PaaS providers is. Allowing users to deploy cloud or on-premise instances of your API resources to Amazon Cloud Formations, Red Hat OpenShift or even Heroku, will define how we deploy and manage APIs in the future.</p>
<p><strong>API Feedback Loop</strong><br /> APIs are all about iterating, hopefully throughout the design, deployment, management, monetization, licensing and evangelism cycles, and Github provides a  perfect platform for managing the feedback loop for each of these iterations. Github issue and milestone manager is increasingly being used to manage feedback around the API design process, all source code, and will play a significant role in external API services, API definitions and the the overall presence of an API.</p>
<p>Github isn&rsquo;t just for server or client API code anymore. Git(hub) can play a central role in not just helping API providers manage a central definition of their API as it pertains to general operations, Github allows providers to interact with other service providers, as well as their API consumers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m intrigued by the many ways API and other service providers are putting Github to use, and will keep paying attention when I have time. I envision Github continuing its evolution as the backbone of public or private APIs, providing a central presence, definition, service integration point, feedback loop, as well source code repository for the thousands of API resources that are being deployed in the coming years.</p>

<p>It is easy to get excited about the potential around &ldquo;big data&rdquo;. Many individuals and companies feel this latest trend is all about offering up big data solutions with business models that are built around algorithms, that founders consider their &ldquo;secret sauce&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I don't have a problem with this, more power to you, however I personally feel big data solutions, especially those within government should be more transparent than many of the secret sauce, big data approaches we&rsquo;ve seen to date.</p>
<p>Alex Howard (<a href="https://twitter.com/digiphile">@digiphile</a>) has a great post at TechRepublic, called <a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/article/data-driven-policy-and-commerce-requires-algorithmic-transparency/" target="_blank">data-driven policy and commerce requires algorithmic transparency</a>, which outlines this very well.  Alex uses the the phrase "algorithmic accountability&rdquo;, which I think sums all of this up very nicely.</p>
<p>When it comes to big data solutions, especially in the public sector, it is fine to collect large amounts of data, offer up analytics, visualizations and other big data tools, but <span style="text-decoration: underline;">algorithmic accountability</span> is something that will be essential in moving forward and building trust across all indusries when it comes to big data.</p>

<p>I wrote about the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/02/01/the-voice-chat-api-is-great-example-of-an-simple-open-api-driven-resource/">interesting approach by Plivo the other day around their Voice Chat API</a>, in which one thing they did really caught my eye, and reflects what I think is the future of APIs&mdash;the deployment of the API to Heroku.</p>
<p>This type of very modular, cloud deployment of fine grain APIs is something that I&rsquo;ve blogged about recently in <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/11/16/modular-apis-driven-from-github-blueprints-using-openshift/">Modular APIs Driven From Github Blueprints Using OpenShift</a>, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/11/20/server-side-api-templates-on-aws-cloud-formation-and-openshift/">Server Side API Templates On AWS Cloud Formation And OpenShift</a>, and <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/12/caching-apis-with-cloudformations-or-openshift-/">Caching APIs With CloudFormations Or OpenShift</a>.</p>
<p>As part of the Voice Chat API, Plivo allows you to deploy an instance of the open source audio conference API to your own Heroku account. This is an interesting way to empower developers to deploy API resources, allowing them to allocate them within their preferred cloud environment, whether it is Heroku, Amazon, OpenShift from Redhat, or any other provider.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t investigated if there are any dependencies between the Voice Chat API and Plivo, but even with dependencies, this approach still holds a lot of promise. This gets us closer to some of my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2013/01/28/virtualized-api-stacks/">earlier thoughts around virtual API stacks</a>, that allow us to build, manage and put to use the most meaningful stack of APIs possible for our applications&mdash;think b<a title="Backend As A Service" href="http://baas.apievangelist.com">ackend as a service (BaaS),</a> but custom fit to exactly the resources we need.</p>

<p>A free, open-source, API driven conference solution called <a href="http://voicechatapi.com/">Voice Chat API</a> popped up on my API monitoring radar today, as I was going through my feeds. The Voice Chat API is a very cool, dead-simple conferencing solution. As a tool it provides clear value, and I really like the approach from <a href="https://plivo.com/">Plivo</a> to rollout out an open, API driven resource like this&mdash;a model that could be applied to other valuable resources.</p>
<p>What really stands out is the Voice Chat API does one thing and does it well&mdash;audio conferences. It is easy to tell what it does. We aren't having to convince users of a problem, then sell them on a solution. The problem is clear, the solution is simple.</p>
<p><strong>Open Source</strong><br /> The <a href="https://github.com/plivo/voicechat/">Voice Chat API is open source and available on Github</a>, built using "Plivo WebSDK and APIs&rdquo;. I haven&rsquo;t investigated the separation between what code is open source, and where the dependencies on Plivo is, but regardless the approach is interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Add-Ons</strong><br /> Providing users with more ways to deploy a conference, the Voice Chat API provides a set of add-ons including a <a href="https://github.com/dhfromkorea/hubot-scripts/blob/master/src/scripts/voicechat.coffee/">Hubot Plugin</a>, that works in Campfire or Hipchat, a <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/voice-chat/mmamadaodppejbaffaagddokjjekifoe">Chrome extension</a>, and a <a href="http://voicechatapi.com/create">bookmarklet for deploying a conference from any other browser</a>.</p>
<p><strong>API</strong><br /> The <a href="http://plivo.github.io/voicechat/">Voice Chat API centers around its API,&nbsp;</a>which allows developers to create a unique audio conference, the call mobile &amp; landline phone numbers (PSTN) into the bridge. The API deploys to your Heroku account, allowing you do manage your ad-hoc audio conference deployments in the cloud.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still playing around with the <a href="http://voicechatapi.com/">Voice Chat API</a>, understanding how the application and the API works, as well as considering how this new open source approach dovetails with Plivo's business model, but now I&rsquo;m intrigued which the approach, and how they crafted this API driven resource.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently reviewing the <a href="http://developer.marvel.com/">Marvel Comics API</a>, and their approach to making their rich content available via a simple web API.</p>
<p>They did a great job deploying the API. To start with they published very simple and honest getting started steps:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Sign Up</strong> - Get an API key</li>
<li><strong>Be A Good API Citizen </strong>- Read, understand, and abide by the terms of use for the Marvel Comics API</li>
<li><strong>Link Back </strong>- Observe the attribution and linking guidelines when displaying data from the API</li>
<li><strong>Keep In Touch -</strong> Tell us about what you're building and talk to other developers on our community page</li>
<li><strong>Build Cool Stuff!</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I like their style. As a building block, getting started pages are pretty important, yet most API providers provide very dry, technical steps for on-boarding with an API&mdash;if at all.</p>
<p>The Marvel Comics API is a refreshing approach to explaining to developers how to get up and running with the API. Its nice to see from such a big brand.</p>

<p>As a proprietor of a small, successful niche blog, I can easily share some insight into why <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66356?hl=en">Google recently started punishing blogs that have guest posts</a>.</p>
<p>At <a title="API Evangelist" href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a> I get about two offers a week from random companies and individuals asking to guest post on my blog. These people cite several reasons for wanting to do it, ranging from me helping them as an aspiring blogger, to them helping me with more content and traffic. If you know me, you know I don't have a problem producing content, and I do not blog because I give a shit about pageviews.</p>
<p>In addition to these smaller, much frequent requests for guest posting. I also get the occasional bigger company looking to &ldquo;partner&rdquo; with me, when in reality they have no desire to partner and generate value for my readers, or move my research forward. These conversations start out entertaining my perspective of partnering and bringing me value, but once I choose to dance with these partners, they almost always start getting heavy handed about me publishing what they want, and providing links to their own sites and content.</p>
<p>My friend <a href="http://mikeschinkel.com/blog/thanks-for-offering-to-guest-blog-or-advertise-but%E2%80%A6/">Mike Schinkel has a great post on this very topic</a>, echoing much of what I&rsquo;m saying.  Mike is like me, he blogs for himself, not to generate pageviews. I started API Evangelist to help me better understand the API space, and while I do have a mission of also educating the masses about APIs, the primary directive is still about educating myself&mdash;without this none of it matters.</p>
<p>The reason Google has begun cracking down is because it is in their best interest to ensure blogs are of the highest quality, unique content possible. What these &ldquo;guest post farmers&rdquo;, and the enterprise companies that employ this same practice don't realize, is their aren&rsquo;t generating any value, they are extracting and diminishing the value of these blogs, and this is what has catching Google&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>On second thought, maybe these companies realize what they are doing. They are just leeches, looking to extract value for their purpose&mdash;at all costs. They don't care about your blog, content or career. They want to suck every last page view from your blogs soul, transferring any value you may have had to their operations.</p>

<p>I am working through some deeper research into the world of <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">API design</a>, and specifically into the world of API definitions. This research involves talking to each of the leading providers, crafting a series of stories along the way, resulting in a white paper that provides an overview of the space and possibly where things are going.</p>
<p>During my conversations with Tony Tam (<a href="https://twitter.com/fehguy">@fehguy</a>) of <a href="https://www.wordnik.com/">Wordnik</a>, creator of <a href="https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core">Swagger</a>, Jakub Nesetril (@jakubnesetril) and Z (<a href="https://twitter.com/zdne">@zdne</a>) of <a href="http://apiary.io/">Apiary</a>, creators of <a href="http://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>, and Uri Sarid (<a href="https://twitter.com/usarid">@usarid</a>) of <a href="http://www.mulesoft.com/">Mulesoft</a>, creators of <a href="http://raml.org/">RAML</a>, I asked a simple question:</p>
<p><strong>What is the vision behind  your API definition format?</strong></p>
<p>Resulting in a little insight behind each approach:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Swagger</strong> - The vision behind Swagger was not to make a company or to get people to use our service, it was strictly to solve a workflow problem. Initially the goal was centered around documentation and client tooling, but quickly realized it was much bigger, and became about managing the overall lifecycle of APIs.</li>
<li><strong>API Blueprint</strong> - API Blueprint is all about simplicity, and allowing people to have a structured conversation around an API, with the people who are actually going to be using it. Apiary is the conduit for this conversation, allowing developers to easily create a mock interface from the blueprint, share with consumers, and iterate as necessary.</li>
<li><strong>RAML</strong> - The motivation behind RAML was about seeking one source of truth, and a basic representation of an API. We used Swagger and API Blueprint, but neither fully met our vision. RAML was born, and is in alignment with Mulesoft's design first approach, and gave them the ability to design an API in a format that allowed them to sit down with stakeholders in a webinar and get instant feedback&mdash;bringing the API to forefront, not the implementation.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are my summarizations of what Tony, Jakub, Z and Uri said in response to my question, not direct quotes. I think they get at the essence of why each company has invested so much in defining an API definition that delivers on their separate visions, and meets their goals</p>
<p>I also think there is a lot of overlap in these visions, as well as being in sync with where the overall demand in the API space is going. I don't endorse one solution over the other&mdash;I think each API designer will choose, and the fact there are multiple approaches is a good thing.</p>
<p>API definitions play a central role in my API design process, but in my personal approach, theAPI server and client code is regularly thrown away, where my API designs remain constant&mdash;something I work to iterate on, much like my writing.</p>
<p>Even with my personal passion for API definitions, I don't think they will be for everyone. I think API designers who find they deliver value in their work will use, while many successful API designers will have no use for them, and be just fine without them.</p>
<p>For some in 2014 API design will be about sharing, collaborating and communicating, in which API definitions will play a central role. For others the API implementation will be where the sharing, collaborating, communicating and ultimately the rubber meets the road.</p>

<p>I was having one of my regular Google Hangouts with the OG API Evangelist John Musser (<a href="https://twitter.com/johnmusser">@johnmusser</a>) the other day as I was flying back from east coast, and he made a comment about my classic API Evangelist drawing, and said I should write the ten commandments of APIs.</p>
<p>At first I thought, not my style, but on second thought, what the hell. Here they are:</p>
<ol class="mainlist">
<li><strong>Deliver Value </strong>- Generate value for consumers, without value APIs mean nothing.</li>
<li><strong>Provide Documentation</strong> - Provide clean, simple, up to date API documentation for users.</li>
<li><strong>Code Libraries</strong> - Deliver code sample, libraries, SDKs, or starter projects in a variety of languages.</li>
<li><strong>Provide Support</strong> - If you don&rsquo;t support your APIs, your efforts won&rsquo;t be sustainable.</li>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Don&rsquo;t Break</span> Minimize Breaking Shit </strong>- You will never establish trust with consumers if you break your shit all the time.</li>
<li><strong>Business Model </strong>- Without a business model for your API, they will not be sustainable.</li>
<li><strong>Terms of Service</strong> - Establish TOS that protect your company's interests, but allow consumers to prosper and grow.</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong> - Establish solid security practices that keep your resources secure, while also protecting all users involved.</li>
<li><strong>Privacy</strong> - Passionately protect the privacy of your API consumers and end-users.</li>
<li><strong>Tell Stories </strong>- Craft and tell meaningful stories about the value your APIs deliver or nobody will will know or care about them.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are my 10 commandments for API providers, and represent what I think are the 10 most important elements of delivering APIs. If you follow these 10 commandments, in your API design, development, deployment, and management you will find happiness. ;-)</p>
<p>These commandments won&rsquo;t guarantee your success in the market, but they will guarantee that you will learn and grow in your API initiative, whether its internal or external&mdash;which in my opinion is the most important aspect of adopting an API way of life.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Adjusting breaking shit, as John cites below. It is inevitable so minimizing is my advice.</p>

        <span class="post-date">30 Jan 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-connected-network.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I'm continuing my exploration of the possibilities of offering up a wholesale version of an API resource. While wholesale is not an option for all types of APIs, there are a subset of APIs that are more utility in nature and would lend themselves nicely to being sold wholesale to other API providers.</p>
<p>I want to better understand the nuts and bolts of what it will take to offer up APIs in this way, and for this exercise I&rsquo;m going to explore providing <a title="screenshot API" href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/06/creating-my-own-screenshot-api/">my recent screenshot API</a> as a wholesale API that other API providers could resale alongside their own resources. An API provider could have their own news, content or other resources, and decide it would be more cost effective to resell my screen capture API, rather than design, deploy and provide their own.</p>
<p>I have designed, developed and deployed my screenshot API, now what do I need to make it available wholesale?</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Definition</strong> - I'll need to have some sort of API definition in API Blueprint, Swagger or RAML to be able to communicate my interface and underlying data model to other providers in a machine readable way that lets them interface with it, as well as potentially develop other tooling around their resale of my resource.</li>
<li><strong>Proxy</strong> - I don't think this this one is a requirement, as some providers would prefer to develop their own proxy layer, but providing a proxy harness that other API providers could use to deploy my API, as a resource within their domain would be a nice to have. Providing it in a variety of languages including PHP, Python, Ruby, C#, Java and Node.js would sensible.</li>
<li><strong>Management APIs</strong> - To support wholesale interactions I would need a set of my own APIs that providers can use to accomplish common API management features like usage volumes, rate limits, and user management if applicable. These services would have to be available as APIs so that providers could seamlessly integrate into their own API management platform.</li>
</ol>
<p><span>That is just a few of the elements I think that I would need to serve up my API in a wholesale way. I might think of more needs as I evolve my thoughts on this, and potentially develop a working prototype around my screenshot API.&nbsp;</span><br /> <br /> <span>Using these tools, an API provider could come and sign up for wholesale access, deploy a proxy within their domain, and use the API definition to deploy interactive documentation that was seamless with their own documentation. Next I see two distinct scenarios for user management around wholesale APIs. You don&rsquo;t want users having to sign up for two separate keys, or even know about the wholesale provider in any way. This is where the management APIs would come in, depending on my business goals that surround my wholesale resources I would employ two user scenarios:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>User Profile Required -</strong> If I wanted to require my API resellers to pass along their user profiles along with API usage I could provide some sort of key translation as part of management APIs and / or as part of the proxy operations. When a new users first uses the API resources, my reseller would have to generate a profile for them in my wholesale system, generating a unique key, and either my system or my resellers would translate keys upon requests. This way I could understand who is using my API resources, and enjoy deeper demographics around API sales.</li>
<li><strong>User Profile Not Required - </strong>Maybe, as a whole provider I don't care about understanding who uses my API at this granular level, I just want to sell, sell, sell. This way I could provide a much more simplified process that would just require resellers to sign up for a single API key, and all API requests are tracked under this single provider key. Resellers would manage their own user keys, and just hardcode all requests to my API with their wholesale key via their proxy.</li>
</ol>
<p>I could understand both of these implementations. Some wholesale providers are going to be obsessed with understanding who is using their API, and require their resellers to be transparent and share their API developer profile data. While I personally think this is overkill, and it would be much simpler to just use a single wholesale key for each reseller--I will assume that most wholesale API providers will go this route.</p>
<p>Next steps for this concept is to actually make it work for real. I have the screenshot API as well as some other similar, utility style APIs, that I wil use as my test cases. I use <a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale API infrastructure</a> for my API management, so I have <a href="https://support.3scale.net/reference/activedocs">APIs for almost all aspects of my API management</a>. I just need to proxy them on my end, and potentially offer up to my prospective API resellers, giving them access to usage, rate limits and user management.</p>
<p>Right now this is just an idea, an academic exercise, but I see no reason this can't be reality and just like other goods and services in the real-world, companies could sell wholesale version of the API resources, further fueling the growth of the API economy.  After making this scenario a little more real, I want to think through what this would look like in an on-premise scenario&mdash;no proxy involved.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Jan 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-classroom.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I recently talked with the AT&amp;T API team about their recent Sabre partnership, which I thought was a pretty interesting <a title="approach to evolving your API strategy, by leveraging your partners" href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/24/work-with-your-partners-to-iterate-on-your-apis/">approach to evolving your API strategy, by leveraging your partners</a>.  As we discussed the overall AT&amp;T API strategy and their approach to partnering, we also discussed the evolution to their hackathon strategy and how they've added workshops to their event toolbox.</p>
<p>While AT&amp;T is very much committed to having hackathons, they didn't always deliver the understanding and feedback around their APIs that they were looking for and decided to develop a workshop format around their developer programs. A workshop is about sitting a group of developers down in a room, provide them with workbooks and other structured content, as well as more direct engagement with the AT&amp;T API team.</p>
<p>I recently spoke with Brian Koles (<a href="https://twitter.com/BrianKoles">@BrianKoles</a>) from <a title="ChallengePost" href="http://challengepost.com/">ChallengePost</a> on the subject, and he says it is what their developer challenge platform company is also witnessing occur in the space. A majority of companies that approach them to do hackathons, in reality don't get what they desire from the more open hackathon format. These companies are looking for a safer, more controlled environment, where they can educate developers about their APIs, and receive quality feedback and measurable results around their API programs.</p>
<p>While a workshop may not be as attractive as the exciting and more intensive hackathon format, it is something that can deliver more meaningful results to your company, as well as reach an audience that probably isn't that interested in spending their weekends, staying up all night, building apps they won't use&mdash;they just want to learn more about your API, and understand how it can solve real-world problems, in their everyday lives.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/01/27/why-is-the-noun-project-api-significant/">Why Is The Noun Project API Significant?</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">27 Jan 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://api.thenounproject.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/noun-project/noun-project-jetpack.gif" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://thenounproject.com/">The Noun Project</a> recently&nbsp;<a href="http://thenounproject.tumblr.com/post/69623674070/launched-the-new-noun-project">launched their API</a>, and after getting off the phone just now with a publication, I looked to see if I had written it up&mdash;I hadn&rsquo;t. I had a lot of thoughts in an Evernote, but I had not really shared my thoughts on why I think The Noun Project API is significant.</p>
<p>If you hadn&rsquo;t noticed, I use <a href="http://thenounproject.com/">The Noun Project</a> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a lot</span> across the API Evangelist Network. Not all of my images are directly from The Noun Project, but they reflect they same general approach. I use The Noun Project for two main reasons:</p>
<ol style="padding-left: 25px;">
<li><strong>On-boarding Users With Abstract Concepts</strong> - It can be hard to convey the often abstract concepts around APIs, and a single, concise image really goes a long way in bringing a user quickly up to speed with what I&rsquo;m talking about.</li>
<li><strong>Simple &amp; Minimalist</strong> - The Noun Project images just look good with the overall API Evangelist look and feel. I don&rsquo;t think this stops with just my website, I think a simple, minimalist image goes a long way in blending in with any site, without cluttering the overall look.</li>
</ol>
<p>When publishing content online, whether its blogging or publishing a list of local events, it can be difficult to capture and keep the attention of your audience. A simple, concise image can go a long way to help convey the meaning of a blog post, event listing, or other content, and on-board users with what you are dishing up, and this is where The Noun Project comes in.</p>
<p>The Noun Project gives you an API to search, pull and manage simple image representations for a person, place, thing, animal or idea. I use a single Noun Project image to accompany each blog post, as well as other elements of my work such as <a title="API building blocks" href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">API building blocks</a>, and tools. The API allows me to integrate images in this way, seamlessly within my content management system.</p>
<p>While I use the Noun Project API to pull meaningful images to accompany my content, there are unlimited uses for the image API, allowing developers to weave the images into their own sites and applications, and potentially extend the images to the end-users of their applications, to accompany their own user generated content.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of image APIs currently available, but <a href="http://api.thenounproject.com/">The Noun Project API</a> is significant because it providers developers with a very focused, meaningful, but powerful way to represent a person, place, thing, animal or ideas in their sites and applications.</p>

        <span class="post-date">27 Jan 2014</span>
        <p><a href="https://cashtie.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/cashtie/cashtie-mobile-barcode.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working with a very interesting new API offering from the retail focused <a href="http://www.incomm.com/">InComm</a>, dubbed the <a href="https://cashtie.com/">Cashtie API</a>. Over the last two decades InComm has worked hard to build relationships with major retailers, resulting in a very hard to establish presence at the cash register of major retailers like Walmart, Target and CVS.</p>
<p>InComm&rsquo;s new Cashtie API opens up access to retailers point of sale (POS) systems, allowing any approved developer to sell online goods to consumers at these high value retail locations&mdash;opening up the possibility for web and mobile applications to accept cash payments for virtual goods, services and utilities at top retailers.</p>
<p>InComm is the company behind gift card activation solutions for all those major gift cards you see everywhere, and digital barcode solutions that we are getting familiar with when purchasing physical goods like a coffee at Starbucks, but the Cashtie is pushing commerce into an entirely new realm.  These earlier solutions are about buying physical goods with virtual gift cards and online accounts, where the Cashtie API is about allowing buy digital goods at retail locations with cash.</p>
<p>The immediate use of cash for purchasing virtual goods can be applied to the hottest virtual products like online movies, music and gaming. Think of the possibilities for impulse buys at the cash register of Walmart and Target, when you aren&rsquo;t limited to the physical items that surround the cash register, but expanded into an unlimited world of digital goods and services.</p>
<p><a href="https://cashtie.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/cashtie/cashtie-billpay.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Opening up cash payments for digital goods to all retail consumers is interesting, but the application that really gets me interested, is delivering applications to what is considered as the unbanked, and underbanked across the nation.  According to the FDIC, 8.2 percent of US households are unbanked, representing 10 million in total, as well as 20.1 percent of US households are underbanked, which represents 24 million consumers&mdash;this is a pretty significant audience to reach with online goods and services.</p>
<p>The Cashtie API opens up an interesting new world of paying cash for digital goods, but also can be easily applied to paying our regular and one-time bills with cash. Currently bill pay with cash at retail locations is a pretty time consuming process, but Cashtie makes it as simple as scanning a barcode on physical utility bills or on your smartphone via a digital barcode. No more going to the information counter at the grocery store, bills can be paid alongside everyday purchases at the regular checkout line in a variety of retail locations.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m intrigued by the potential of the Cashtie API. Those of us who live and breathe the online world may think the world revolves around us, but a significant part of world still operates on a cash-only basis. The Cashtie API bridges these two worlds, allowing cash to buy virtual goods, augmenting our existing ability of buying physical goods with virtual currency.</p>
<p>I will be working with InComm to developer their API strategy, and hoping to tell the stories that come out of this interesting new ecosystem. I&rsquo;m pretty picky about who I work with at API Evangelist, and while there will be uses of the <a href="https://cashtie.com/">Cashtie API</a> that won't capture my attention, I predict there will be some very meaningful uses that deliver value to a very underserved segment of our society.</p>

<p>Amazon has an interesting <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/post/Tx3VAMG90LQR7DF/Amazon-Instant-Access-Sell-Digital-Items-for-Your-PC-Mac-or-Web-Based-Applicatio.html">new service called Instant Access</a>, which follows a trend I&rsquo;m seeing in commerce, that allows the sales of digital goods, not just in-app like <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/apis/earn/in-app-purchasing">Amazon&rsquo;s In-App Purchasing</a> does, but let&rsquo;s you sell your digital wares on Amazon.com.</p>
<p>This new service allows you to list and sell your digital goods on Amazon.com, just like the physical goods you normally associate with Amazon. This opens up your digital products to the heavy traffic of Amazon.com, as well as the other perks like discoverability, reviews, and the payment systems that the Amazon platform enables.</p>
<p>Amazon Instant Access connects customer&rsquo;s profiles with your application profiles, and triggers digital products sales in your system, using your API. To do this, you provide Instant Access with API endpoints for triggering profile creation or linkage, and for initiating digital product sales that are coming from Amazon.com.</p>
<p>Now you can generate new sales, as well as allow your existing customers to use Amazon.com for searching, browsing and purchasing your digital products&mdash;changing the dynamics of virtual commerce. This opens up another reason for you to have APIs for your customers, as well as for your physical and virtual products. If you don&rsquo;t have APIs, you will be limited to attracting customers and sale of your products via your website and applications.</p>
<p>If you do have APIs for your customer profiles, and physical and virtual products and services, you can open up the sale of your products via 3rd party platforms, including commerce giants like Amazon.com.</p>

        <span class="post-date">25 Jan 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-storytelling.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done 3 stories over the last week about the Panoptix API from Johnson Controls (JCI). I try to regularly check in with the <span>John Bernd (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/jkbernd">@jkbernd</a><span>) and Simone Vigano (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/viganosimone">@viganosimone</a><span>)&nbsp;</span> of the <a href="https://whatspossible.johnsoncontrols.com/community/panoptix-developer-center">Panoptix API</a> team, and see what they are up to in the world of building efficiency APIs.</p>
<p>What make this possible is their willingness to share stories, trust in me that I&rsquo;m going to tell these stories in the best possible light, but also no fear of what people think of their approach. John and Simone share my humble view, that we are all just figuring this shit out as we go along. Of course it is based upon experience, and both sensible strategical and tactical execution, but in the grand scheme of things, there is no single master plan for success.</p>
<p>You'd be surprised at the number of people who call me, share stories about their internal API operations, then conclude the conversation by telling me that I can&rsquo;t tell publicly for fear of what the public will think, or fear of upsetting folks within their own company. Sometimes I tell the stories with names and identifying elements scrubbed, but often I just add to my wealth of knowledge of move on.</p>
<p>Teaching individuals and companies how to tell stories and open up, and be more transparent, is the number one benefit of APIs in my opinion. All the business benefits in new revenue streams, efficiency, agility, innovation and all the other reasons I often cite are secondary to helping companies learn to open up.</p>
<p>What is your company&rsquo;s stance on storytelling, and sharing both the good and bad of your API operations?</p>

<p>One of the areas I track on is what I call the <a title="API reciprocity" href="http://reciprocity.apievangelist.com">API reciprocity space</a>, which is all about interoperability between platforms, but I label it reciprocity as an attempt to capture that it isn&rsquo;t just about old school <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load">Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL)</a> of the old days&mdash;today it is about ETL in the cloud, plus adhering to the intent of not just platforms, but the users interest as well.</p>
<p>When thinking of API reciprocity, think <a href="https://ifttt.com/">If This Then That (IFTTT)</a>, <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a> and <a href="https://temboo.com/">Temboo</a>. I&rsquo;ve been watching Temboo evolve with their API driven, platform to platform solutions, but I&rsquo;m really interested in there latest moves to support web platforms to the Internet of Things using the Arduino platform, specifically using the <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardYun?from=Main.ArduinoYUN">Arduino Y&uacute;n micro controller board</a>.</p>
<p>Temboo has been working hard recently to <a href="https://www.temboo.com/arduino">connect the Arduino Y&uacute;n to over 100 web-based resources and services</a> like Facebook, Twitter and Dropbox.  The Arduino Y&uacute;n gives you connectivity to lights, motion, sound, temperature and other sensor based devices, and Temboo provides the connectivity between these sensors to the numerous API driven resources in the cloud.</p>
<p>Taking it to the next level, <a href="https://temboo.com/library/Library/devices/">Temboo has released Sketch Builder</a>, an application that allows anyone to design interactions between Arduino Y&uacute;n and Temboo enabled cloud services. This opens up this type of Internet of Things to web service interaction design, development and deployment to anyone, not just developers.</p>
<p>APIs are moving forward at a very rapid pace, and as we move from the mobile era of APIs into the Internet of Things phase of APIs, the pace is going to quicken. APIs aren't just about social, cloud and mobile anymore&mdash;innovators like Temboo at bridging all of the APIs driven platforms we depend on, to our physical world via sensors.</p>

<p>Saturday afternoons are great for closing out tabs I&rsquo;ve had open all week, and the theme this Saturday is APIs and the Internet of Things. This time it is about <a href="http://community.thingspeak.com/2014/01/introducing-talkback-the-new-internet-of-things-app-to-control-things-with-the-thingspeak-cloud/">controlling your Internet of Things using voice the Thingspeak Talkback API</a> and the Arduino Y&uacute;n, which seems to be the darling of API to Internet of Things projects.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://thingspeak.com/docs/talkback">Thingspeak Talkback API</a> allows for the adding, updating, deleting and executing of voice commands. It acts as a middleware for the <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardYun?from=Main.ArduinoYUN">Arduino Y&uacute;n</a>, allowing IoT devices to to be able to check for commands that need executing&mdash;providing an API driven queue of voice commands for all of the Internet connected devices in your life.</p>
<p>As the cost of connecting everyday objects to the Internet gets easier and cheaper, it is fascinating to see the different approaches that providers take to connect these objects to the web. Thingspeak is choosing to go the voice route, where Temboo is betting on the fact that people want to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/25/interoperability-between-web-and-internet-of-things-opening-up-to-nondevelopers/">connect IoT devices with their existing cloud platforms and services</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">24 Jan 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://developer.att.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/att/att-logo.jpg" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I received a press release from AT&amp;T last week, about a <a href="http://www.att.com/gen/press-room?pid=25205&amp;cdvn=news&amp;newsarticleid=37388&amp;mapcode=consumer%7Cmk-att-business-customer-">new partnership with Sabre to develop what is called location information services (LIS)</a>. Ben Kepes has a <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/benkepes/2014/01/22/att-and-sabre-join-up-to-stalk-travellers-in-a-nice-way/">good summary of the partnership over at Forbes</a>, so I won't add my own analysis of what the partnership means. After speaking with the AT&amp;T team today, and I&rsquo;d prefer to focus on the importance of partnerships when developing your own APIs--sharing AT&amp;T's wisdom with my audience</p>
<p>When listening to Laura Merling and Chris Aron of AT&amp;T talk about the Sabre partnership, I couldn't help but think about the importance of working with trusted partners, in developing your valuable API resources. In the open API world, many companies open themselves up to iterating on API resources with a large group of public developers, a process that can make your API strategy feel very schizophrenic&mdash;in contrast making designing, developing and iterating on API design in closed environment with trusted partners much more, well sane.</p>
<p><strong>Location Information Services With Transportation and Travel Partners</strong><br /> The location information services that AT&amp;T is partnering with Sabre on, began as a set of location services they first worked with AAA on to help them locate drivers in need of roadside assistance. Now AT&amp;T is working with Sabre to evolve these same location APIs and expand not just to new business sectors like travel or retail, but improve accuracy of a mobile user's location by not just using a cell signal, but also wifi and bluetooth.</p>
<p><strong>Mobile Identity Toolkit With Banking and Financial Partners</strong><br /> In addition to location APIs, AT&amp;T recently developed a <a href="http://developer.att.com/apis/mobile-identity-toolkit">mobile identity toolkit</a> and what better way to help define the most valuable toolkit possible, then to work with banking and financial partners to design and deploy a toolkit that reflect exactly what they need.  The result is a set of API fueled services that makes apps more secure, and reduces fraud via mobile devices.</p>
<p><strong>Sponsored Data With Multiple Partners</strong><br /> Beyond location and identity, AT&amp;T has also been working on the APIs that drive their new <a href="http://www.att.com/att/sponsoreddata/en/index.html">sponsored data initiative</a>. This new program is much more sensitive than other API resources, as it directly touches AT&amp;T user's bills, and required working with trusted partners to define a set of services that worked properly. AT&amp;T worked with existing partners in defining everything from how the APIs will work to how these sponsored data services would end up looking on AT&amp;T customers bills.</p>
<p>These are three examples of how AT&amp;T is leveraging partners to plan, design, develop and evolve their catalog of API resources. While AT&amp;T has their <a href="http://developer.att.com/apis">open developer ecosystem</a>, a partner centric approach keeps things on track, by defining APIs that have proven needs, via existing partners, and represent expanding on existing revenue streams.</p>
<p>As with the rest of us in the space, AT&amp;T is working to figure out the best path forward with APIs. Their approach to leveraging their partner ecosystem to provide fuel for their API initiatives is something we can all learn from. I&rsquo;m not saying stop evolving your public APIs out in the open, but for newer, or possibly higher value API resources, you may want to consider kicking things off with your trusted partners.</p>

<p>Some of the best stories I hear as the API Evangelist, are the internal success stories around API efforts. Everyone wants to be the next Twilio success story with their API, but in reality the API use cases that will make the biggest impact, will be the ones within your own organization.</p>
<p>In my story queue I have two stories coming from very different API efforts, but they both have a similar theme regarding APIs starting conversation internally&mdash;something that couldn&rsquo;t have occurred, if they didn&rsquo;t already have APIs.</p>
<p><strong>Johnson Controls (JCI) / Panoptix</strong><br /> While talking with the <a href="https://whatspossible.johnsoncontrols.com/community/panoptix">Panoptix team</a> last week, they told me about making the rounds within JCI to talk APIs and strategy with other groups, and how they were surprised to learn that another group within JCI not only had heard of the Panoptix API, they had already integrated with it. Apparently the separate group caught wind of what Panoptix was up to and because the API was self service, they registered, began playing with, and found a use for the resources, and integrated into their own operations. A great story of not just internal API usage, but of self-service APIs, and how API can change things within an organization without you even knowing.</p>

As we exchanged war stories he mentioned a city agency that he went to visit to discuss their data resources, and how the conversation had quickly shifted to discussing other available city API resources, that they could put to use in their own operations. While working in the federal government this is one area I see APIs having the biggest impact--inter-agency API usage. In Philly, Marks role is to go around and assess the open data resources of each group, and the potential for deploying APIs, but quickly he is finding that making agencies aware of other agency&rsquo;s API assets is extremely critical to making things work. Internal API evangelism isn&rsquo;t just about getting people on board with deploying APIs, it is also about getting internal groups on board with consuming each others APIs.</p>
<p>These are just two short stories that show the power of APIs, and how they can impact your organization internally. These conversations would never have happened if JCI and City of Philadelphia weren&rsquo;t already deploying APIs. You can&rsquo;t kickstart this type of innovation with just talk of APIs, you need to have APIs up and running, working in a self-service way, and then you&rsquo;ll start seeing change in this way.</p>
<p>My number one post of all time on API Evangelist, doing at least 2K page views a month, even after two years, is <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/">The Secret to Amazons Success Internal APIs</a>, which talks of Amazon&rsquo;s own success with the internal usage of APIs. The external usage and effects of APIs is what attracts many businesses and organizations to the world of APIs, but it will be internal usage and effects that makes them stay for a while.</p>

        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/google-map-logo.gif" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>According to Keir Clark over at <a href="http://googlemapsmania.blogspot.com/">Google Maps Mania</a>, we are seeing <a href="http://googlemapsmania.blogspot.com/2014/01/the-slow-death-of-google-maps-api.html">The Slow Death of the Google Maps API</a>. Who else could read the tea leaves, when it comes to an API, than a blogger who is dedicated to covering the innovation that comes out of a single API ecosystem.</p>
<p>Clark has noticed that "there seems little sign of the Google Maps API team returning from their two year vacation&rdquo;, and "at the same time the MapBox team has continued to innovate and has now become the maps API of choice for most developers&rdquo;.</p>
<p>While nobody knows the reasons Google Maps has stopped innovating (except Google), it is clear that you can&rsquo;t stop delivering value to developers, or they will migrate elsewhere to find the API resources they need for their applications&mdash;it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you are Google, or any other tech giant.</p>
<p>Mapping darling <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/">Mapbox</a>, and open source JavaScript library <a href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a> has seemed to captured the attention of developers by delivering simple, open solutions&mdash;while also continuing to iterate and deliver features that keep up with the needs of developers.</p>
<p>The Google Maps API is one of the API pioneers listed on my <a title="history of APIs" href="http://history.apievangelist.com/">History of APIs</a>, but much like Delicious, maybe the age of Google Maps is coming to a close. I&rsquo;m sure many mainstream websites and applications will use Google by default because of the advertising and SEO opportunities, but for developers who care about providing beautiful, seamlessly blended maps that add value to their websites and apps, I think Google Maps just isn&rsquo;t going to do it anymore.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2014/01/22/the-evolving-motivations-behind-api-definitions/">The Evolving Motivations Behind API Definitions</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">22 Jan 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-evolving.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m spending more time diving into the evolving world of API design over the next couple of weeks. There is a rapidly emerging community of companies, tooling and approaches to designing and developing APIs, that is centered around API definition languages.</p>
<p>Languages for defining web services have been around for a while, with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Application_Description_Language">Web Application Description Language (WADL)</a>, which was born out of the SOAP WSDL era, representing very technical approach to describing this new world of web APIs. While WADL is still in use, it hasn&rsquo;t seen the adoption many envisioned.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until recently that we&rsquo;ve seen new approaches emerge, and get traction, with JSON based API definitions like <a href="https://developers.helloreverb.com/swagger/">Swagger</a> from <a href="https://www.wordnik.com/">Wordnik</a>, and <a href="http://www.mashery.com/product/io-docs">I/O Docs</a> from <a href="http://www.mashery.com/">Mashery</a>. The primary motivation behind defining your API using Swagger or I/O Docs has historicaly been to deploy interactive documentation for developers, with discovery, client-side code generation, server-side code generation and other tooling as secondary motivator, if at all.</p>
<p>In the last year we&rsquo;ve also seen even newer approaches to designing and defining APIs emerge, with the introduction of markdown based API definitions like <a href="http://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a> from <a href="http://apiary.io/">Apiary</a>, and <a href="http://raml.org/">RAML</a> from <a href="http://www.mulesoft.com/">Mulesoft</a>. This new markdown approach is&nbsp;providing languages for describing and defining APIs that holds the promise of even being accessible to non-developers.</p>
<p>I have time scheduled to talk with each of the providers listed above in the coming weeks, but after a talk with the API Blueprint team from Apiary, I&rsquo;m reminded of how the motivations for API definitions is continuing its rapid expansion. When you are motivated to use API definitions for just generating API documentation, you miss so much opportunity for communicating, collaborating and iterating during the planning and design of your API.</p>
<p>API Blueprint was born out of Apiary, so it is rooted in the desire to design and mockup APIs, all while collaborating with other key players and the actual consumers of the API. If you wait to generate an API definition when you reach the point where you are ready for documentation, you are throwing away valuable design time, and burning costly development hours. Apiary needed a way to articulate, share and communicate around the design of an API from start to finish, pushing the motivation for developers to generate an API definition, from producing interactive docs, to devliering on the entire API planning, design, development, deployment and management lifecycle.</p>
<p>We need these new languages to describe and communicate around APIs. Without them we can&rsquo;t mockup, iterate and collaborate to find the best possible API design. Without these new languages we can&rsquo;t quantify APIs to key business, marketing, and sales players, as well as the lawyers, providing a contract for not just machine to machine interaction, but B2B and B2C. Without these new languages we can&rsquo;t generate standardized tooling and API deployments based upon the best API patterns available today.</p>
<p>I think that the fact that there are now 4 major API design approaches, represents not just an evolution in the motivation for developers to use common definitions for APIs, but also a shift that will make API design accessible to everyone, motivating even non-developers to communicate and interact with APIs, in a simple, but powerful way that can align IT and development, with overall business goals.</p>

<p>The team over at <a href="https://whatspossible.johnsoncontrols.com/community/panoptix">Panoptix</a> turned me on to the the <a href="https://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/commercial/seed_platform.html">Standard Energy Efficiency Data (SEED)</a> platform being developed over at the Department of Energy, which aims to be an API for collecting, storing and analyzing building energy performance data.</p>
<p>It appears that DOE is looking to develop open source software that state and local governments can use to manage energy efficiency across their buildings.</p>
<p>I like the approach to develop an open source, API driven platform that can set the tone for how data can be collected, managed, and shared. I think this is a great way to lead in an industry, and bring together not just government entities but other private sector players.</p>
<p>SEED is something I&rsquo;d love to see work, and an API design I&rsquo;d love to see in the <a href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>. If you are part of the SEED project, I&rsquo;d love to talk more. I pinged the email on the site, but haven&rsquo;t heard anything.</p>
<p>Good stuff coming out of DOE lately.</p>

The simple, black and white icons work very well with my minimalistic look, and help me convey some very abstract API concepts.</p>
<p>As I was reviewing the Noun Project API, looking at what resources are available via their API endpoints, I noticed a /usage endpoint,  which lets you understand your API usage, as well as the rate limits for your API access level. This isn&rsquo;t revolutionary, its something I've seen on other APIs, but it is an important resource I think many API owners overlook.</p>
<p>Providing an API usage endpoint by default for all APIs makes sense. Developers can either build into their apps, or just setup some sort of daily job, that alerts them when they are approaching API rate limits. Much like push notifications on your bank account or other online resources, a usage API will go a long way in helping developers quantify and understand what resources they have available to them, as well as what they consume on regular basis.</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Jan 2014</span>
        <p><a title="Evercam.io" href="http://www.evercam.io/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/evercam/evercam-logo.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I look at a lot of APIs--some are crap, some make sense, a few are interesting, and every great once in a while you see an API that you know will be one of the next big API platforms.  I&rsquo;m reviewing one such API, <a title="Evercam.io" href="http://www.evercam.io/" target="_blank">Evercam.io</a>.</p>
<p>I know that Evercam.io will be be big, because it bridges an increasingly ubiquitous technology&mdash;the camera. Whether its its for home or commercial usage, Internet connected cameras represents low hanging fruit for applying proven API techniques.</p>
<p>Evercam.io was born out of experience working at a <a href="https://cloud.camba.tv/">cloud CCTV company</a>, where the Evercam team realized the opportunity was about becoming a developer platform that enabled any developer to interact with potentially hundreds of types of cameras, while also applying modern API techniques to the world of security and webcams.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Cameras + Oauth 2.0 + API + App Store = Evercam.io</strong></p>
<p><strong>Storage</strong><br />When it comes to video, the obvious API usage involve storage of the video, still photos, audio, and logs generated by a video camera. The cloud opens the ability to scale storage to match whatever needs the camera owner may have. Video potentially can be disk heavy, something that is perfectly suited for the cloud, as long as someone is willing to pay for the storage.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-surveillance-camera.jpg" alt="" width="225" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>Connectivity</strong><br />Cameras are just one node, in this fast growing world of Internet connected devices that you may find at home or in the business. The ability to sync up cameras and still photos with point of sale (POS) activity, sensors or even other cloud applications is significant. Zapier and IFTTT like actions or seamless reporting and analytics across systems will open up with API deployent.</p>
<p><strong>Events</strong><br /> Evercam.io introduces events as a layer between the camera and users, allowing developers to define custom or scheduled events based upon what happens in a video. Examples include sending of MMS when camera receives SMS from owner, take picture of storefront or dining area each hour or during peak hours.  Video is all about a sequence of events, and adding an API layer allows for an unlimited amount of slicing and dicing and custom defined of events that are meaningful to camera owners.</p>
<p><strong>Logging</strong><br />One of the significant benefits of API layers between camera and their access layers is the ability to log operations. Camera availability, access logs, events, actions and basically any interaction with a camera potentially can be logged. When used for security, this API layer expands on the existing definition of what a security camera is used for.</p>
<p><strong>Marketplace</strong><br />Any successful platform needs a marketplace, where developers can showcase the applications they've engineered on top of the platform, and even generate revenue through application sales and add-ons. Evercam.io has a marketplace out of the gate, modeled after the Chrome Web Store and Force.com, which charges developer s30% of revenue generated via the apps they publish to the marketplace.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong> <br />Deployment of an API for one or many cameras, provides a single point of security for all devices. This is only as good or bad as Evercam.io&rsquo;s platform security, which only time will tell how solid it is. This one element will make or break platforms like Evercam, and is the area that will keep me up at night when thinking about API driven cameras.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.evercam.io/2014/01/weighbridge-integration-using-evercamio.html" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/evercam/evercam-weigh-docket-camba-integration.jpg" alt="" width="325" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Ok, now I&rsquo;ve laid out some of what I feel will be key things that make Evercam.io significant. I think Evercam.io will be big because it represents a fairly obvious target for applying APIs, and the deployment of cameras, as well as the use of video is only going to grow--exponentially.  I don&rsquo;t just think that Evercam.io will be big because of the technological and business opportunities, I think it will be huge because of the political implications.</p>
<p>Our homes and automobiles will be increasingly wired with cameras, businesses will be operated, managed and secured through cameras, and governments will increasingly monitor citizens via Internet connected video devices. Camera APIs will be one of the most influential, yet silent players in our personal and professional lives, from here on forward&mdash;there is no escaping it.</p>
<p>Honestly all of this has me worried, but I&rsquo;ve done my due diligence on the Evercam.io team, and feel like there isn&rsquo;t a better crew I&rsquo;d like to see help lead in this potentially frightening new world of Internet connected cameras. I try to help lead the API space by shining the light on some of the positive in the space, while calling out potentially negative practices. I think the Evercam.io team reflects these values, and I&rsquo;m interested in seeing more of how they handle it in this potentially volatile aspect of our online world.</p>
<p>It can be easy to freak out over some of the potentials for exploitation via a platform like Evercam.io, but after reading their business plan, and looking through their site, you see examples like the&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.evercam.io/2014/01/weighbridge-integration-using-evercamio.html">agricultural scale that uses a camera and the Evercam.io API to take pictures of grain deliveries</a>, providing the pictures as part of the grain sale process. These are every day uses that will have significant implications on the economy and become regular part of business operations.</p>
<p>After spending some time researching Evercam.io, and thinking about the world of Internet connected cameras, I&rsquo;m intrigued. I&rsquo;m interested in seeing what solutions get developed on the platform, how security is handled, and what issues arise in different scenarios when you connect cameras to the Internet, apply APIs and start building applications and logging tools that operate in this new API defined space.</p>
<p>I predict the Evercam.io ecosystem will grow rapidly, and be an interesting, and potentially scary place to watch our world be connected to the Internet via billions of tiny cameras, that track on every aspect of our personal, business and increasingly very public lives.</p>

<p>Right now when it comes to API discovery you have the OG <a href="http://programmableweb.com">ProgrammableWeb</a>, and newcomers <a href="http://mashape.com">Mashape</a> and <a href="http://apihub.com">APIHub</a> (which also owns ProgrammableWeb). All three of these sites provide you with a large directory of APIs you can search and browse at, when looking for APIs.</p>
<p>I pull new APIs from all these sources, in hopes of staying in tune with what is out there. However, I have a different approach to my API database of APIs. I only keep track of the best APIs I see. I'm not concerned with every API available, I&rsquo;m interested in the best approaches to APIs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping in 2014 that we'll see more niche API hubs emerge, that specialize in specific areas like government, finance, photos, video and other specific areas that developers would be specifically interested in--allowing domain experts to step in and help guide us.</p>
<p>When looking at the big picture it can be hard to see the gaps and opportunities. If you specialize in a particular area, you really get to know what resources people are offering, how they are serving these resources up, and potentially what is missing fro the consumer perspective.</p>
<p>This doesn't have to be exclusive from the existing efforts, Mashape and APIHub could provide more curation tools for domain experts to use in organizing, deploying and management of these hubs. &nbsp;</p>

        <span class="post-date">20 Jan 2014</span>

<p>When I <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/12/17/making-an-impact-on-environment-with-building-management-apis/">last talked with the Panoptix API team over at Johnson Controls (JCI)</a>, they were working hard on new features, including the possibility of writing data to the <a title="building efficiency APIs" href="https://whatspossible.johnsoncontrols.com/community/panoptix">building efficiency API(s)</a>.</p>
<p>A year later, I wanted to see where the team was at with their API efforts and was intrigued to learn that their work to make their API writable hadn&rsquo;t gone exactly as they had planned.</p>
<p>On the surface it sounds like an easy task. You can pull data from an API, now using POST, PUT and DELETE you should be able to write data back into the system. Easier said than done, says <span>John Bernd (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/jkbernd">@jkbernd</a><span>) and Simone Vigano (</span><a href="https://twitter.com/viganosimone">@viganosimone</a><span>)&nbsp;</span> of the Panoptix API team.</p>
<p>First you have all the technical issues around data storage, indexing, accessibility and the usual problems you face with managing lots of data. Working with known data from their own systems and devices is one thing, but opening it up to wider audience takes some extra work.</p>
<p>Second you have to think about the legal issues. Who&rsquo;s data is it? Do they have the right to publish it. What are the legal responsibility of JCI and Panoptix? Once you open up a system for publishing of data, you open yourself up to a whole new world of legal headaches.</p>
<p>Once you allow write capabilities for Panoptix API users, whats next? What features are needed. How much will all this cost to develop, manage and evolve? Opening up a lot of business questions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big proponent of APIs being not just read, but also write. I rail on city, state and federal governments, stating this is one of the biggest problems with government APIs--the lack of writeable APis. However I understand it is not as easy as it seems, and agree with the Panoptix team, that it is something you have to think through all the pros and cons. Then take your time, build a proper strategy, and do it right.</p>

        <span class="post-date">19 Jan 2014</span>

<p>Just exactly what an API is, is always up for debate. APIs have been around since before the Internet. API Evangelist focuses in on what I call web APIs, that were built using the same technology as websites, and were made even popular for delivering valuable data and resources to mobile phones. While there are device APIs on phones, that give you access to resources like the camera or microphone, web APIs are the choice of developers when it comes to delivering popular cloud based resources like friends, photos and video to mobile apps.</p>
<p>Web APIs, are using the Internet to deliver common resources that websites, web and mobile apps need to operate. With the dominance of mobile devices, and the emergence of the Internet of things, we are now seeing APIs that move beyond just this general approach, and focusing on delivering resources tailored to specific devices, or device groups.</p>
<p>As I do with everything, I&rsquo;m just shedding more light on what is already happening out there. Daniel Jacobson of Netflix has been talking about <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2012/05/15/why-rest-keeps-me-up-at-night/">Why REST Keeps Me Up At Night</a>, and how Netflix is catering to hundreds of devices for some time now.</p>
<p>So, getting to my point, I was reading two separate articles about new Google APIs:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><a href="http://www.webpronews.com/google-details-google-drive-android-api-2014-01" target="_blank">Google Details Google Drive Android API</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.droid-life.com/2014/01/16/google-working-on-fitness-api-for-android/" target="_blank">Google Working on Fitness API for Android</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In both of these new APIs, Google is developing APIs that cater specifically to Android devices. Google has radically different motivations for delivering device based APIs than Netflix, but I think their focus on the device is still a relevant aspect of this trend in API design. General purpose APIs are common, but is Daniel right about where we are going with APIs?</p>
<p>Will we continue to see APIs tailored for specific devices? What will happen with the Internet of Things? Will there be APIs that are tailored for home automation devices or just our cars? There are a lot of important API design questions to be asked in 2014. I&rsquo;ll keep my eye out for some of the answers as I track on the world of APIs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">18 Jan 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/nest/nest-thermostat.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was doing some research on a video camera API platform that I'm keeping an eye on, and <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2014/01/17/google-nest-and-the-3-2-billion-api/">Google, Nest and the $3.2 Billion API</a> by Roberto Medrano of SOA Software popped up in my curation system.  The <a href="https://nest.com/">Nest</a>&nbsp;is currently the best known example of APIs being placed in between us, and everyday objects in our lives. The enhanced objects, and the applications that emerge are the obvious value, that end users see, however as Robert says:</p>
<blockquote><em>These decisions will be strategic business and financial ones, but they will all be enabled by the use of APIs. Without the API involved, the work required to connect products such as Google and Nest would be too complicated or costly.</em></blockquote>
<p>When I think about devices like the Nest, in our homes, the obsessive compulsive geek in me gets excited for the potential of such a platform. However after I apply a little critical thought, I get very concerned. Then I immerse myself back into what is possible when cameras have APIs, security camera, street cameras, webcams&mdash;all have APIs. Then I get very, very concerned.</p>
<p>After this roller coast I come back to a balanced view, that smoke alarms, thermostats and cameras equipped with APIs are neither good, bad or neutral. That cat is out of the bag, and we have this technology. It isn&rsquo;t going away. We might as well enjoy the positive, but we also need to keep an extremely close eye on how things are being deployed and managed behind the scenes.</p>
<p>There is a lot of room for logging as part of the regulatory process, democratizing access of resources, and generally injecting transparency into how things work with these Internet enabled, API driven &ldquo;things&rdquo;. However there is also a whole lot of room for exploitation, surveillance and hijacking of data via these Internet enabled, API driven &ldquo;things&rdquo;.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t freeze up with fear or lash out against this coming wave of Internet enabled things, we have to keep a level head, ask hard questions and make sure there is a healthy balance in all of the API driven, Internet enabled nodes where hardware manufacturers, platform providers, developers and user&rsquo;s best interests are kept in mind.</p>

<p>I just had a great conversion with John Bernd (<a href="https://twitter.com/jkbernd">@jkbernd</a>) and Simone Vigano (<a href="https://twitter.com/viganosimone">@viganosimone</a>) of <a href="http://www.johnsoncontrols.com/">Johnson Controls (JCI)</a>, who lead efforts  at the building efficiency API, <a title="building efficiency API" href="https://whatspossible.johnsoncontrols.com/community/panoptix">Panoptix</a>.  They shared several great stories with me, I&rsquo;ll trickle out over the next week, with the first one about internal evangelism.</p>
<p><a title="Internal evangelism, whether your API is public or private, is something I&rsquo;ve advocated for pretty heavily over the last few years" href="http://apievangelist.com/2011/09/29/api-evangelism-is-equal-parts-internal-partner-and-public-outreach/">Internal evangelism, whether your API is public or private, is something I&rsquo;ve advocated for pretty heavily over the last few years</a>. Lack of internal evangelism around an API can be the number on reason you get your API defunded within any size organization. Basically if the rest of the company, included your bosses , don&rsquo;t know about your API and the success you&rsquo;ve had, your done. So tell stories about your API.</p>
<p>This particular story out of JCI is particularly interesting because it isn&rsquo;t just about evangelizing your API, its evangelizing your approach to delivering your API. Over the last couple years of the Panoptix API, John and Simone have done a great job evangelizing the Panoptix API internally (separate story coming soon), but somehow in the hustle they forgot to package up and sell their approach to delivering the Panoptix API, so other groups within JCI can learn about and put the API approach to use for their own needs.</p>
<p>Panoptix realized they need to document their own approach to designing, developing, deploying and managing the Panoptix API, create a case study that they can then evangelize within JCI. The benefits of separating data and resources, establishing self-service APIs, establishing meaningful metrics combined with analytics, and the overall health brought by an API centric approach, was something that every group within JCI needs to understand.  <a href="http://www.3scale.net/tag/panoptix/">Panoptix uses 3Scale API infrastructure</a>, and has been <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/12/17/making-an-impact-on-environment-with-building-management-apis/">reading API Evangelist for a couple years</a>, resulting in their own unique approach to API delivery, you can experience within the <a href="https://whatspossible.johnsoncontrols.com/community/panoptix">Panoptix developer community</a>.</p>
<p>Hearing John and Simone talk through their realization, made me see another layer to internal API evangelism. You shouldn&rsquo;t just have a coherent API design, deployment, management and evangelism strategy so that you can execute on it, you should have one so that you can clearly articulate it to the rest of your company and help onboard them with your API centric approach to getting things done.</p>

One feature I noticed when playing with my account settings, was the ability to set the default licensing for my "things".</p>
<p>Interestingly this is a feature you don't see in many SaaS apps, let alone as part of API developer settings. I remember first seeing this in my Flickr account settings, and is something I wish I&rsquo;d see it in every platform I use (keep dream'n buddy).</p>

<p>When it comes to user generated content via APIs, this licensing is kind of a big deal. It decides as a user and developer, who ultimately owns the exhaust from your work or just from your daily online world.</p>
<p>I'll be including licensing considerations in the future discussions around the politics of APIs. A setting to determine how user generated content is licensed should not just be a setting in your application account settings, but baked into API developer account settings as well.</p>

<p>I started API Evangelist in 2010 to help business leaders better understand not just the technical, but specifically the business of APIs, helping them be successful in their own API efforts. As part of these efforts I track on what I consider the <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">building blocks of API management</a>. In 2014 I'm also researching what the building blocks are in other areas of the API world, including API <a title="API Design" href="http://design.apievangelist.com">design</a>, <a title="API deployment" href="http://deployment.apievangelist.com/">deployment</a>, <a href="http://discovery.apievangelist.com/">discovery</a> and <a title="API integration" href="http://integration.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html">integration</a>.</p>

<p>I'm <a title="API Design" href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/16/api-design-do-you-swagger-blueprint-or-raml/">looking at the world of API design</a> right now, but once I'm done with that research, I will be diving into API integration again, trying to better understand the key players, tools, services and the building blocks they use to get things done.</p>

        <span class="post-date">16 Jan 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://design.apievangelist.com/" target="_blank"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-evangelist/services/api-design.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m spending the next couple weeks going through each of the leading API design approaches: API Blueprint, RAML and Swagger.  Even though I still personally use Swagger in my own work, I&rsquo;m pushing myself to learn API Blueprint and RAML to better understand the landscape, as well as the pros and cons of each approach.</p>
<p>If you aren&rsquo;t familiar with this emerging trends in API design, they are approaches to defining your APIs either using JSON or a markdown language, which allows you to quantify and describe the API interfaces and underlying data models in a way that allows you to communicate with others, generate mock or production APIs, interactive documentation, code samples and potentially other tooling that will help you be successful in your API initiatives.</p>
<p>While there are other approaches, I&rsquo;m focusing on what I consider to be the three leading approaches right now:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li><strong><a title="API Blueprint" href="http://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a></strong> - Using API Blueprint gives you awesome tools for your whole API lifecycle. Use it to discuss your API with others. Generate documentation automatically. Or a test suite</li>
<li><strong><a title="RAML" href="http://raml.org/index.html">RAML</a></strong> - RESTful API Modeling Language (RAML) is a simple and succinct way of describing practically-RESTful APIs. It encourages reuse, enables discovery and pattern-sharing, and aims for merit-based emergence of best practices</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://developers.helloreverb.com/swagger/">Swagger</a></strong> - Swagger is a specification and complete framework implementation for describing, producing, consuming, and visualizing RESTful web services. The overarching goal of Swagger is to enable client and documentation systems to update at the same pace as the server</li>
</ul>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel there is a right or wrong answer to which API design provider you choose. What I want to understand is the nuances of each, how they help us define our APIs, what tooling is available for each, and what does the overall community of developers look like for each.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very interested in the potential of these API design approaches empowering not just developers, but reaching a larger business audience with API design tooling and a language to articulate, and communicate around API resources.  APIs are a very intangible thing, and anything we can do to make them easier to describe is a big deal.</p>
<p>Over the next couple weeks I will be playing with several basic &ldquo;hello world&rdquo; examples with API Blueprint, RAML and Swagger to help demonstrate what is possible. Then I hope to get more advanced, and understand the tooling available to me from each platform. I&rsquo;ll even look through their roadmaps and talk to their creators to see what the future holds when it comes to API design.</p>

<p>Have you taken a look at the <a title="Thingiverse Developer Area" href="http://www.thingiverse.com/developers">Thingiverse developer area</a> lately? It&rsquo;s been a while since I reviewed it. A couple years ago while working at <a href="http://www.mimeo.com/">Mimeo</a> as an API evangelist I had the pleasure of doing some deep research into not just printing APIs, but <a title="3D printing APIs" href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/12/19/api-driven-3d-printing-and-manufacturing-supply-chain/">3D printing APIs</a>&nbsp;as well. I wrote a lot on the subject, but overall I was unhappy with what was available in the areas of 3D printing APIs.</p>
<p>When you go to the Thingiverse API now, the landing page immediately tells you what is possible, gives you direct links to API documention, but also provides you what you need to get started, sign up and explore the Thingiverse API&mdash;a flow that is so very important!</p>
<p>When you look at the API docs, you immediately see that the API is a simple web API allowing you to manage users, things, their files and copies, while being able to tag, build collections as well as look for the newest, popular and featured things. The Thingiverse API interface is simple, well designed and actually allows you to access some seriously valuable 3D printing resources.</p>
<p>Thingiverse also delivers other critical resources, providing FAQs, application gallery, hackathon and challenge calendar, and a terms of service that provides a <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/legal">plain english translation for developers</a>. All essential resources to supporting and growing your API ecosystem.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m impressed with the Thingiverse API, not just because it delivers what I envision a 3D printing API should look like, but it is a well-designed, simple implementation of what any API program should look like as well.</p>

<p>API Terms of Use is the single most important building block of any ecosystem, yet it is the least discussed area of API management and integration. I&rsquo;m working hard to dedicated more time in 2014 to not just the area of API TOS, but what I consider to be the politics of APIs.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s focus is on making a plain english translation of your terms of service available. I came across a great example over at <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/developers">Makerbot Thingiverse</a> today, where they add:</p>
<blockquote><em>We realize Terms of Service can be confusing and, quite frankly, a snooze- fest; however, they are very important in explaining the basis of what we, the Company, expect of you, the User, while on this Site and how this interaction plays out. We promised &ldquo;understandability&rdquo; so, to the right of each term, we provided a summary in &ldquo;plain English&rdquo;.</em></blockquote>
<p>Music to my ears. Every time I come across an <a title="example of plain english terms of use" href="http://www.thingiverse.com/legal">example of plain english terms of use like this</a>, I&rsquo;m going to write a short blog post on it.

        <span class="post-date">13 Jan 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-json-data-store.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m playing catchup on some of my projects, and one of them is tracking on the evolution of <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/09/executive-order-making-open-and-machine-readable-new-default-government">Executive Order 13642</a> from last May, which was the White House directive to make open and machine readable the new default for government information. The piece that I'm tracking on specifically right now is around the <a href="http://project-open-data.github.io/policy-memo">OMB Memorandum M-13-13</a> Open Data Policy-Managing Information as an Asset, in which one of the items require agencies to publish a data.json file that provides a machine readable inventory of each agencies public data assets.</p>
<p>In short, each federal agencies should round up a list of all their public data assets, make a machine readable JSON file from that list, and publish to the web.  The deadline for publishing was November 30, 2013, and I got caught up in my FAFSA work and the holidays happened, resulting in just getting a chance to take a look at truly take a look at where our government is at with this.</p>
<p>To really quantify where we are at, you have to execute on the core vision of the mandate&mdash;write a script to pull all the federal agencies data.json file. First you pull all the agency&rsquo;s root url using the Federal Agency Directory API from <a href="http://www.usa.gov/About/developer-resources/federal-agency-directory/">USA.gov</a>. Then you append data.json to the end of each address, pull each data.json file and get to work!  When executing on this work, you encounter the problem of <a href="http://kinlane.com/2013/11/06/knowing-your-http-status-codes-in-federal-government/">inconsistent HTTP status codes from agency</a>, which I talked about before. Once you navigate this I find:</p>
<ul>
<li>22 Federal Agency Data.json Publish (I also see SEC published, what they did is another story)</li>
<li>5,558 Public Datasets Published (6,479 actual distributions)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just my initial pull, and resulting count. I have only begun hand evaluating what is published, what is not. This is good though right? 22 federal agencies successfully publishing a data.json file for a combined 5,558 datasets available! I know how hard this was to make happen, and I commend everyone for their hard work.  I&rsquo;m a big fan of acknowledging the hard work that goes into this, but then also big fan of pushing back to make sure we keep working. So let&rsquo;s break M-13-13 down, and see if we are really on track.  What did I see during my initial pulling of these 22 data.json files?</p>
<p><strong>Validate Your Data.json Files</strong> <br />My number of piece of advice to give to agencies is make sure you validate your data.json files. <a href="http://jsonlint.com/">JSONLint</a> is a free tool, head over there, paste in the contents of your data.json file. Do this after EVERY change. If your data.json doesn&rsquo;t validate, it will just be a headache for consumers. Before you validate, also work hard to clean up your descriptions, abstracts and other fields. Make sure you do away with unnecessary quotes, slashes and other garbage that is just unnecessary.</p>
<p><strong>Size of Data.json Files</strong><br />Some of the files are pretty big (wink wink EPA, DOT). I&rsquo;m not sure what the solution is for this, but the bigger the file, the more compute it takes to process. We all need to discuss the solution for this, because it is only going to get worse, and will pretty quickly become unsustainable.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Data.json Fields </strong><br />Overall agencies make good use of the common core meta data fields as recommended in the <a href="http://project-open-data.github.io/schema/">open data implementation guide for M-13-13</a>. Agencies provided a wealth of descriptions, tags and even provided relevant contact info and other important meta data for listings. I'm analyzing all the fields used an will be providing a deeper analysis of how well they tagged, are there duplicate descriptions. in the near future.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Distribution Field</strong><br />There is one critical field in each data.json listing called distribution, which can be a listing of multiple file types for a single data set. For example the dataset might be a list of government acronyms, and you might have a CSV version, as well as Spreadsheet, XML and / or JSON versions. There are 5,858 datasets I&rsquo;ve recorded so far, and there are 6,479 distributions for those datasets. However, only 3,766 of the 5,858 datasets use the distribution field, relying on the Download URL or Access URL as the reference to where the dataset is located&mdash;this is a problem.</p>
<p><strong>Format Types of Distribution Files</strong><br />One of the benefits of an agency using the distribution field, is that each entry has a format field, allowing me to understand the format of each dataset, such as HTML, XML, JSON, CSV or other. While this value should be a valid <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_media_type">internet media typ</a>e--they all pretty random entries. So the best I can extrapolate right now is 2,550 are html, 2,479 are xml, 13 are json 177 are csv, 285 are xls and the rest are some other format&mdash;including PDF which, well, which is a problem.  Another big problem is almost half are html references, which if it meant structured HTML would be one thing, but mostly means it is a web page with some sort of form you can extract data yourself (not in line with M-13-13 vision).  So 2,954 are truly machine readable (the whole point of the exercise), and 2,904 are not really or can&rsquo;t be identified as so. Ok, so around 50% of the datasets are machine readable (maybe, hopefully), which will have to be tested with another round of scripts and lot of work.</p>
<p><strong>Tracking Progress </strong><br />How do we track progress on what is going on with federal agency&rsquo;s data.gov files, from here forward? The best I can come up with for right now is to store a copy of data.json files each time I pull. You can find these archives on my <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/federal-government/tree/gh-pages/data/json-archive">federal government research Github repository</a>. I will also be pulling a copy of the 6,479 dataset distributions and storing on Amazon S3, depending on what it costs me to pull, transfer and store. Then I will work on some diff, and month to month analytics based upon agency&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p><strong>Overall Quality Of Datasets </strong><br />I give the overall data.json effort of agencies a C grade. It very much has that, &ldquo;we got our homework in on time&rdquo; feel to it. The leading agencies did what they were supposed to, but ultimately didn&rsquo;t put a whole of of care into the quality of work. The 5000+ datasets reflect what I was saying in my advice for the federal government that came out today on Govfresh, we have a lot of house cleaning to do.</p>
<p>So how should OMB, OSTP and GSA respond to this C level effort by federal agencies? They should:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Help the agencies who DID publish, refine what they published. Bring in outside help if necessary, clean up data, listings and demonstrate to agencies what was done, and how they can continue doing better in the future.</li>
<li>Help the agencies who DID NOT publish, by going through their websites, finding high value, already published datasets and convert them to JSON and generate a data.json file for them to publish on their websites.</li>
</ul>
<p>This would help agencies who are already on board understand more about what is needed from the consumer side of things, and why quality in their data..json listings and datasets is so very, very important. It would also help agencies who aren&rsquo;t on board get their data inventory process kickstarted. It should all be able to be done in Q1 2014, then by Q2 we can get rolling with next steps with Data.gov.</p>
<p>As I said earlier, I&rsquo;m not naive about the amount of work that went into the 22 agencies getting these 5,000+ datasets published, but we can&rsquo;t stop there. If you want to see meaningful data journalism, data visualizations, web and mobile apps incorporate this hard work into their own efforts, we have to clean things up. Remember Washington, you can&rsquo;t do it alone. You have to figure out a way to open these up and allow the public to help clean, organize and add value to the data you have published in addition to your own efforts.</p>
<p>It is a healthy start, but we have so much more work.</p>

<p>During the recent federal government shutdown this last fall, the concept of API redundancy became much more important for me, and I hope for others as well. The need to ensure public open data and APIs, as well as private sector resources, stay available is becoming increasingly vital.</p>
<p>As I work through these thoughts I'm playing with different approaches to caching some types of APIs. In my experimentation, I'm using <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">AWS CloudFormation</a> and <a href="https://www.openshift.com/">RedHat OpenShift</a>&nbsp;to deploy caches of commonly used APIs resources.</p>
<p>Each type of API deployment is designed to sync with the mothership upon activation, and then receive regular updates of data via API + webhooks, with all updates to the code being done with Github.</p>
<p>In the future maybe we can make API addressing work somewhat like peer-to-peer file sharing, where I can receive multiple API endpoints for a common resource. Of course this wouldn't work for more unique APIs, but for commonly used APIs it could be a way to create redundancy and establish in fault tolerance in our applications.</p>
<p>At first I will be testing this out with data APIs like government facility locations by topic or state, then more complex API resources like website screenshots, or image manipulation APIs. If you have any specific type of API you'd like to see deployed in this way, let me know.</p>

<p>I had a friend ask me for help with their talk submission for <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/index.php">#APIStrat in Amsterdam</a>. He was concerned that his talk was too product pitchy, and wanted help making it something that not just would be accepted by our event, but something community would want to hear.</p>
<p>It is good to hear the concern, its true we want the best talks at #APIStrat, we don&rsquo;t want to have a bunch of product pitches, we are seeking stories of API strategy and the practices from the trenches of API design, deployment and management.</p>
<p>Additionally, the audience doesn't want to hear it. I know many companies are focused on selling their products and services, but event audiences don't care. #APIStrat participants wants to hear about how you are solving the problems they face, using APIs.</p>
<p>Sure your product or service may solve their problems, but telling them this isn't good enough. You need intelligently articulate the problem and walk the the story of how the problem can be solved, in a compelling way. Sure your product or service may be woven in there, but it can't be the central actor in the story. You need to work extra hard to find a story that is meaningful to the #APIstrat audience, and provide details they can take home with them and apply in their own worlds.</p>
<p>We are still looking for more stories of <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/index.php">API Strategy &amp; Practice</a> from the trenches. Our <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Amsterdam/contact-call-for-papers.php">call for papers</a> is only open for another week, so make sure and polish your story and get it submitted.

<p>I have no problem with experimentation and playing around with different resources, and even the deprecation of APIs, with appropriate communication, when it makes sense. I know Ericsson exploration is via their labs, and isn't really meant for production, but it grinds on me when there are APIs be played with, then all of sudden one day they are gone, with no trace.</p>
<p>If you are experimenting with APIs, I recommend leaving some sort of landing page behind, with some trace of the exhaust from your research, experimentation--if possible open source your work. You put APIs out there and expect developers to come, play and give you feedback with no compensation&mdash;the least you can do is leave some of that research or assetts behind for the industry to put to use, or at least for us to understand that this has occurred at some point in time.</p>
<p>I don't know why your API initiatives didn&rsquo;t work or were closed down, but I think in general it leaves a bad taste in developers mouths--I know it sure does in mine. Experimentation and iteration is fine, but if you want the public to care about your research in the future, leave some of the exhaust from your research behind, so we can derive meaning and value fromit. If nothing else, just a landing page that explains what happened, otherwise we wil stop giving a shit in the future and are unlikely to participate.</p>

<p>The latest<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/ibm-forms-watson-business-group-will-commercialization-follow-7000024929/"> tech news to come out of IBM this week is a brand new business group to push innovation around the IBM Watson platform</a>, with IBM committed to spending $1B on the new business group, with $100M set aside to fund startups who build on top of the Watson platform.</p>
<p>The introduction of the new business group may be in response to the media&rsquo;s, and analyst&rsquo;s chatter about less than impressive results so far with the Watson platform&rsquo;s ability to generate revenue, with <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304887104579306881917668654">$100M revenue over the last three years, according to the Wall Street Journal</a>.</p>
<p>There was a post on on ReadWrite today, called <a href="http://readwrite.com/2014/01/10/watson-fails-to-compute-hadoop#awesm=~osBWHG1mh2rWcB">IBM's Watson Fails To Compute In A World Of Open-Source Hadoop</a>, where Matt Assay nails the reason: <em>Where Are The Watson Developers?</em></p>
<p>When you visit the "<a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/innovation/us/watson/index.shtml">IBM Watson Ecosystem Program</a>&rdquo;, you get a lot of text, and then even more text contained in PDF&rsquo;s telling how much you can innovate with the platform. Then when you are ready there is a pretty lengthy form to fill out, where you can tell them what you want to do with Watson, and hit submit and hope they will let you in. They also have a Twitter, Facebook and Youtube account, but really it doesn't smell of &ldquo;ecosystem&rdquo; where &ldquo;innovation&rdquo; is happening.  I've looked at over 10K &ldquo;ecosystems&rdquo;, which about less than 500 are truly &ldquo;innovating&rdquo;, and after a while you start to be able to smell the signs of success.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying the IBM Watson platform doesn&rsquo;t offer value, I&rsquo;m just saying the team doesn't know how to make "innovation" happen. They need to loosen up, stop being so enterprise, and open up a little bit. We know you got some APIs behind there, make them accessible to ANYONE, make registration self-service, and give us some dead simple, meaningful, powerful web API endpoints to play with that will stimulate our imaginations.</p>
<p>There are proven ways to limit the access new developers so they don&rsquo;t get out of hand, and models for developing incentive ladders that incentivize developers to not just play, but actual develop solid apps that can deliver and will actually evolve into real world business models.</p>
<p>Analytics and feedback loops can be put in place that allow you to easily control the moochers and bad actors, while stimulating and listening to the true innovators, allowing the Watson team to iterate and evolve API endpoints that don&rsquo;t just cater to one industry, but any business sector.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just develop an powerful resource like Watson, make it available in the cloud, label the platform an&ldquo;ecosystem&rdquo;, provide some case studies and innovation magically happens. You have to let go a little, and allow developers to come on board, play, imagine, fail, and push the boundaries of what is possible. This doesn&rsquo;t happen when you have total control over everything that happens.</p>
<p>Bringing a true developer ecosystem to life around Watson will be more than just about the technology, you need to put in place the essential building blocks developers need to be successful, let a little oxygen into the mix, then I think you will find the innovation and ultimately the revenue you are looking for from Watson.</p>

<p>There is an excellent post in GovFresh by former Presidential Innovation Fellow and Githubber Ben Balter (<a href="https://twitter.com/BenBalter">@BenBalter</a>), <a title="Why no one uses your government data" href="http://govfresh.com/2014/01/one-uses-government-data/">Why no one uses your government data</a>?</p>
<p>Ben is looking to address one of the biggest problems with open data in government. That data is just opened, purely to check a box on some requirement imposed on agencies. The data steward doesn&rsquo;t actually put any thought into how the data will be used, and is just taking advantage of positive re-enforcement associated with opening up the data.</p>
<p>This is not just a problem in federal, state or city government. This same problem occurs in the private sector as well. While it takes work to open up data and other resources via APIs, it takes even more work to see things through the eyes of a consumer. Making the data clean and actually usable by data journalists, in visualizations and applications is hard work.</p>
<p>We need to raise the bar when it comes to open data. If you work in government, non-profit or company, your work isn&rsquo;t done when you release your open data or API, you need to see things through and ask yourself one simple question: <strong><em>How can you optimize the experience for the consumer?</em></strong></p>

<p>Building on my last post,&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/10/lessons-in-gov-open-data-optimize-for-consumer/">Lessons In Gov Open Data: Optimize For Consumer</a>, I want to share another important lesson for people working on open data in government. This very important lesson is about good data narration or storytelling around your data, not just publishing it as is.</p>
<p>This lesson is triggered by a great post over at <a title="Gnip" href="http://blog.gnip.com">Gnip</a>, where <a href="http://blog.gnip.com/data-narration/">Eric Swayne, Director of Product of MutualMind talks about the fundamentals of good data narration</a>.  Swayne starts out by saying that:</p>
<blockquote><em>People that live in data analysis have the crucial opportunity for extracting meaning that transforms businesses through data-driven decisions, and it takes much more than just pushing out the monthly graphs and charts</em></blockquote>
<p>Swayne continues to talk about the trademarks of good data narration which include true insights, user-centric approach, and idea inception. This is critical in releasing data in government, it isn&rsquo;t just about the release, it is about releasing the data, providing insights associated with the data, and tailoring it for as wide as possible audience, with the goal of triggering something new within the minds and imaginations of these potential consumers.</p>
<p>Remember, if you are opening up data in government, your work is not done once you release. It is your role as a data steward to narrate and tell the story of the data in a way that will relay the value to potential end-users and consumers, so that they may build on that value through visualizations, applications and even other stories--without the story it is just data. :-(</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 Jan 2014</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 20px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/api-service-providers/apiaxle-logo-2.png" alt="" width="175" align="right" /></p>
<p>I got a email today letting me know that <a href="http://apiaxle.com/docs/acquisition-statement/">cloud platform Exicon, purchase API management provider ApiAxle</a>, further whittling away at all of the original and second wave of API management providers I&rsquo;ve been tracking on over the last 4 years.</p>
<p>ApiAxle first showed up as a blip on my <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/06/15/roundup-of-20-api-service-providers-in-2012/">2012 API management provider roundup</a> when:</p>
<blockquote><em>ApiAxle started out as a side project when Phil Jackson was CTO at Qwerly and found their API management provider didn't quite fit the needs of a busy, commercial API. API growth had already exploded back then and so, in the same way you could pick from a plethora of databases or webservers, there seemed an obvious space for an open source API management platform. That's when ApiAxle was born.</em></blockquote>
<p>According to Phil Jackson, the ApiAxle brand will continue to live as part of the Exicon suite of products, and he will keep evolving his baby. While it is 2014 now, I would consider this acquisition the last of a string of API management acquisitions we saw in 2014 which included Layer7, Mashery, and Apiphany.</p>
<p>These leaves just a handful of API management providers on the acquisition table in 2014, including 3Scale, Apigee, Mashape and Apiary.io. Who is next? Will API management platforms be as hot of a commodity in 2014?</p>

        <span class="post-date">09 Jan 2014</span>
        <p><a href="http://federal-government.apievangelist.com/" target="_blank"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/Building-a-21st-century-platform-to-better-serve-the-american-people-1.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Data.gov has continued to evolve, adding data sets, agencies and features. With recent, high profile stumbles like with Healthcare.gov, it can be easy to fall prey to historical stereotypes that government can't deliver tech very well. While this may apply in some cases, I think we can confidently get behind the movement that is occurring at Data.gov, with 176 agencies working to add 54,723 data sets in the last 12 months.</p>
<p>I feel pretty strongly that before we look towards the future of what the roadmap looks like for Data.gov, we need to <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/06/what-is-next-for-the-us-government-api-strategy/">spend a great deal of time refining and strengthening what we currently have available at Data.gov</a>, and across the numerous government agency developer areas. Even with these feelings, I can't help but think about what is needed for the next couple years of Data.gov, in a more technical sense.</p>
<p>Maybe I'm biased, but I think the next steps for Data.gov is all API. How do we continue evolving Data.gov, and prepare to not just participate, but lead in the growing API economy?</p>
<p><strong>Management Tools for Agencies</strong><br /> We need to invest in management tools for agencies, commercial providers as well as <a href="https://github.com/NREL/api-umbrella">API Umbrella</a>. Agencies need to be able to focus on the best quality data sets and API designs, and not have to worry about the more mundane necessities of API management like access, security, documentation and portal management. Agencies should have consistent analytics, helping them understand how their resources are being accessed and put to use. If OSTP, OMB, GSA and the public expect consistent results when it comes to open data and APIs from agencies, we need to make sure they have the right management tools.</p>
<p><strong>Endpoint Design Tools for Data Sets</strong><br /> Agencies should be able to go from dataset to API without much additional work. Tools should be made available for easily mounting published datasets, then allow non-developers to design API endpoints for easily querying, filtering, accessing and transforming datasets. While data download will still be the preferred path for many developers, making high value datasets available via APIs will increase the number of people who access, that may not have the time to deal with the overhead of downloads.</p>
<p><strong>Common Portal Building Blocks</strong><br /> When you look through each of the <a href="http://www.data.gov/developers/page/developer-resources">50+ federal agency /developer areas</a>, you see 50+ different approaches to delivering the portals that developers will depend on to learn about, and integrate with each agencies APIs.  A common set of building blocks is needed to help agencies standardize how they deliver their developer portals. Each individual approach might make sense within each agency, but as a consumer when you try to work across agencies it can be a confusing maze of API interactions.</p>
<p><strong>Standard Developer Registration<br /></strong> As a developer I need to establish a separate relationship with each federal agency. This quickly becomes a barrier to entry, one that will run off even the most seasoned developers. We want to incentivize developers to use as many federal APIs as possible, and by providing them with a single point of registration, and a common credential that will work across agencies will stimulate integrations and adoptions.</p>
<p><strong>Standard Application Keys</strong><br /> To accompany the standard developer registration, a standard approach to user and application keys is needed across federal agencies. As a user, I should be able to create a single application definition and receive API keys that will work across agencies. The amount of work required to develop my application and manage multiple API keys will prevent developers from adopting multiple federal agency APIs. Single registration and application keys will reduce the barriers to entry for the average developer when looking to build on top of federal API resources.</p>
<p><strong>Developer Tooling and Analytics</strong><br /> When integrating with private sector APIs, developers enjoy a wide range of tools and analytics that assist them in discovering, integrating, managing and monitoring their application's integration with various APIs. This is something that is very rare in integration with federal government APIs. Standard tooling and analytics for developers needs to become part of the standard operating procedures for federal agency /developer initiatives, helping developer be successful in all aspects of their usage of government open data and APIs.</p>
<p><strong>Swagger, API Blueprint, RAML</strong><br /> All APIs produced in government should be described using on of the common API definitions formats that have emerged like Swagger, API Blueprint and RAML. These all provide a machine readable description of an API and its interface that can be used in discovery, interactive documentation, code libraries and SDKs and many other uses. Many private sector companies are doing this, and the federal should follow the lead.</p>
<p><strong>Discoverability, Portable Interfaces and Machine Readable by Defaul</strong>t<br /> As with open data, APIs need to be discoverable, portable and machine readable by default. Describing APIs in Swagger, API Blueprint and RAML will do this. Allowing APIs to be presented, distributed and reused in new ways. This will allow each agency to publish their own APIs, but aggregators can take machine readable definitions from each and publish in a single location. This approach will allow for meaningful interactions such as with budget APIs, allowing a single budget API site to exist, providing access to all federal agencies budget without having to go to each /developer area, but there are many more examples like this that will increase API usage and extend the value of government APIs. If you are familiar with data.json, think api.json.</p>
<p><strong>API Hubs</strong><br /> A new breed of API directories have emerged. API portals like <a href="https://www.mashape.com/">Mashape</a> and <a href="http://www.apihub.com/">API Hub</a> don&rsquo;t just provide a directory of APIs, they simplify API management for providers and integration for API consumers. Federal agencies need to make their APIs friendly to these API hubs, maintaining active profiles on all platforms and keeping each API listed within the directories and actively engaging consumers via the platforms. Federal agencies shouldn&rsquo;t depend on developers coming to their /developer areas to engage with their APIs, agencies need to reach out where developers are already actively using APIs.</p>
<p><strong>Consistent API Interface Definition Models</strong><br /> Within the federal government each API is born within its own agencies silo. Very little sharing of interface designs and data models occurs across agencies, resulting in APIs that may do the same thing, but can potentially do it in radically different ways. Common APIs such as budget or facility directories should be using a common API interface design and underlying data model. Agencies need to share interface designs, and work together to make sure the best patterns across the federal government are used.</p>
<p><strong>Webhooks</strong><br /> In the federal government APIs are often a one-way street allow developers to come and pull information. To increase the value of data and other API driven resources, and help reduce the load on agencies servers, APIs need to push data out to consumers, reducing the polling on APIs and making API integration much more real-time. Technologies such as the Webhook which allows API consumer to provide a web URL, in which agencies can push newly published data, changes and other real-time events to users, are being widely used to make APIs much more of a two-way street.</p>
<p><strong>Hypermedia</strong><br /> As the world of web APIs evolve there are new approaches emerging to delivering the next generation of APIs, and hypermedia is one of these trends. Hypermedia brings a wealth of value, but most importantly it provides a common framework for APIs to communicate, and provide essential business logic and direction for developers, helping them better use APIs in line with API provider goals. Hypermedia has the potential to not just make government assets and resources available, but ensure they are used in the best interest of each agency. Hypermedia is still getting traction in the private sector, but we are also seeing a handful of government groups take notice. Hypermedia holds a lot of potential for federal agencies, and the groundwork and education around this trend in APIs needs to begin.</p>
<p><strong>Evangelists Present</strong><br /> The first thing you notice when you engage with an government API, is nobody is home. There is nobody to help you understand how it works, overcome obstacles when integrating, there is no face to the blog posts, the tweets or the forum replies. Federal government APIs have no personality. Evangelists are desperately needed to bring this critical human element to federal government APIs. All successful private sector APIs have an evangelist or an army of evangelists, spreading the word, supporting developers, and making things work. We need open data and API evangelists at every federal agency, lettings us know some one is home.</p>
<p><strong>Read / Write</strong><br /> I know this is a scary one for government, but as I said above in the webhooks section&mdash;APIs need to be a two way street. There are proven ways to make APIs writeable without jeopardizing the integrity of API data. Allow for trusted access, let developers prove themselves. There is a lot of expertise, &ldquo;citizen cycles&rdquo;, and value available in a developer ecosystem. When a private sector company uses federal government data, improves on it, the government and the rest of the ecosystem should be able to benefit as well. The federal government needs to allow for both read and write on APIs&mdash;this will be the critical next step that makes government APIs a success.</p>
<p>These are just 14 of my recommendations for the next steps in the API strategy for the federal government. As I said earlier, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/06/what-is-next-for-the-us-government-api-strategy/">none of this should be done without first strengthening what we all have already done in the federal government around open data and APIs</a>. However, even though we need to play catch up on whats already there, we can&rsquo;t stop looking towards the future and understand what needs to be next.</p>
<p>None of these recommendations are bleeding edge or technology just for technology sake. This is about standardizing how APIs are designed, deployed and managed across the federal government, emulating what is already being proven to work in the private sector. If the federal government wants to add to the <a href="http://www.opendata500.com/">OpenData500</a>, and establish those meaningful stories needed to deliver on the promise of open data and APIs--this is whats needed.</p>
<p>With the right leadership, education and evangelism, open data and APIs can become part of the DNA of our federal government. We have to put aside our purely techno-solutionism view of #OpenGov and realize this is seriously hard work, with many pitfalls, challenges, politics and that in reality it won&rsquo;t happen over night. However, if we dedicate the resources needed, we can not just change how government works, making it machine readable by default, we can forever alter how the private and public sector partners.</p>

<p>It has taken me a while to respond to a post I read this weekend, by Mike Caulfield (<a href="https://twitter.com/holden">@holden</a>) called <a href="http://hapgood.us/2014/01/03/revenge-of-the-os/">Revenge of the OS</a>. In short he points out the fragment world we live in with all of our apps, and the shortcoming of tech companies to actually deliver a solution that truly works for end-users.</p>
<p>Our desktop computer has always been the doorway to our digital worlds, and then came the Internet, and the Web 2.0 age where iGoogle (now dead), Facebook Apps (how many apps do you use these days), and other &ldquo;mega-services&rdquo; promised to be the doorway to our now online digital worlds.</p>
<p>Mike talks about how his daughter, who 4 years ago depended on Facebook to access her world, now &ldquo;moves fluidly between Tumblr, Snapchat, Instagram, and Vine accounts, with the notifications panel her point of integration&rdquo;. Our devices have become the doorway to our online, digital lives.</p>
<p>All of this is the result of tech companies, driven by their VC overlords, pushing to become the point of control for user identity and the pipes in which that users data flows&mdash;-at all costs! Sure these companies pay lip service to the interoperability that could fix this and employ OpenID, oAuth and use APIs, but without true investment and an honest belief in interoperability with other platforms, even competitors, it all means absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>The tech giants have the power to lead, come together and establish strong openID or oAuth alliances, strengthening tools, simplifying user experience, but they don&rsquo;t. Innovative startups like <a href="http://oauth.io">oAuth.io</a> from Webshell, and <a href="http://zapier.com">Zapier</a> are left to do the heavy lifting, and the user is still left with a fragmented, cumbersome experience as they jump from cloud to cloud, across potentially several devices like smart phone, laptop, xBox, and tablets.</p>
<p>This world is only going to get worse, tech companies of all sizes show very little interest in truly working together. Sure, there are anomalies, and every has their own APIs, but there are no meaningful API standards, very little sharing of API interface designs and no investment in common identity approaches and tooling.</p>
<p>This insanity will grow exponentially defined by the number of internet connected devices that we adopt, including phones and tablets, but is being extended to our cars, homes, clothing, glasses and much, much more.</p>

<p>Building on my thoughts around <a title="preparing your API for wholesale access" href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/09/is-your-api-ready-for-wholesale/">preparing your API for wholesale access</a>, I&rsquo;m thinking through the problem of developer API access when you have API providers offering up each others APIs, and bundling them seamlessly as part of their own API stack.</p>
<p>In this scenario I&rsquo;m working through, API provider A has an API they offer up wholesale to partners, and API provider B wants to bundle API provider A&rsquo;s API along with their own, adding value to their API and developer community.</p>
<p>In this scenario API provider B doesn&rsquo;t want their developers to have to sign up for a separate API key with API provider A, the developer should just have to create one account and use one key for their application.</p>
<p>To make this seamless, both API providers need to have their own APIs for their API management system, allowing users and keys to be provisioned programmatically. All API provider A needs to do is create a service tier for their wholesale partners to have access to account and application provisioning, so their partners can seamlessly generate new accounts for their new developer accounts and switch API keys when developers uses the wholesale API.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t just an academic exercise. It is possible when your <a title="API management infrastructure has an API like 3Scale provides their customers" href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">API management infrastructure has an API like 3Scale provides their customers</a>. I just think API providers aren&rsquo;t thinking at this level yet, and thinking about how the future of how their APIs will be consumed in the future, and the potential of sharing users with their API partners.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll keep exploring the various elements needed to make your API available in a wholesale way. Having an <a title="API for your API management infrastructure" href="https://support.3scale.net/reference/activedocs#/account_management_api">API for your API management infrastructure</a> is definitely essential, and next I will be looking at having a machine readable API definition, and permissible terms of service (TOS).</p>
