<p>I've been <a href="https://integriography.wordpress.com/2016/07/11/doidoe-did-not-ban-dji-products-but/">reading a number of stories about concerns within the Department of Interior about the usage of DJI drones as part of their UAV operations</a>. Whether or not the federal agency actually issued a ban on using the drones is another story, regardless I wanted to extract this concept and apply to the wider world of Internet of Things, in which drones are definitely a poster child for.</p>
<p>In our race to connect devices to the Internet, at the consumer and industrial level, what considerations are being made regarding what data is collected, how this information is transmitted (via which networks), and ultimately where is data being stored (which country). Obviously, this is something the federal government is beginning to think about, but I'm guessing hasn't fully formed an approach to dealing with this problem consistently across agencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>People love to dismiss individual consumer right to know about their data at this level, as nobody cares enough, but at the corporate, institutional, and agency level we better be taking things a little more seriously. If you are uploading your organizational intelligence unknowingly to servers out of the country, or in jurisdictions where it might be easily shared with your competitors or rival factions--you might want to be thinking about switching providers. ;-)</p>
<p>As platform providers how will we be certifying the chain of custody for the Internet-connected devices we are manufacturing, and within the applications and system they employ? As device consumers, how will we ensure that ALL the devices we are employing are in sync with our organizational mission and governance?&nbsp;</p>
<p>So many interesting questions being asked right now, as we race to wire up our physical world to the Internet...</p>

<p>I wish every time you came across facts and statistics in any news story, blog post, report, and beyond, there would be an interactive experience like you get with <a href="http://www.census.gov/quickfacts/dashboard/SEX255215/45,32">the US Census Bureau's QuickFacts tool</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>QuickFacts provides statistics for all states and counties, and for cities and towns with a population of 5,000 or more, and provides everything I think you need to make the case behind any facts and statistics you are presenting.</p>
<p>Using the tool you get a table, chart, map, data download, email results, and share via popular social networks as well as embeddable tooling. The QuickFacts experience should be a default for all storytelling around open data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Census team has clearly worked very hard to make a wealth of very complicated data much more accessible, usable, and easily understood through proven approaches to telling stories using open data.</p>
<p>If you are in the business of publishing open data and APIs&nbsp;and building analytics and visualization tools, follow the lead of the US Census Bureau, and develop easy to use API tooling like the QuickFacts solution.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Aug 2016</span>
        <p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-algorithmic-transparency.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></p>
<p>API Evangelist is focused on helping push for sensible API-driven transparency wherever I can get it. When done in sensible ways an API can crack open the often black box&nbsp;that is the algorithm,&nbsp;giving us access and more control over our online experience.</p>
<p>One of the most significant algorithmic bottlenecks that govern our daily lives is our mobile data plans. All of our mobile phones are governed at the data plan level--this is where the telecom companies make their money, throttling the bits and bytes we depend on each day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The mobile data plan is a great place to discuss the algorithmic and data transparency that APIs can assist with, and one example of this in action is with the <a href="http://youtube-eng.blogspot.com/2016/04/announcing-mobile-data-plan-api.html">Google Mobile Data Plan API</a>. Google wants more access at this level to improve the quality of experience for end-users when using mobile applications like Youtube, which can be severely impacted by data plan limits, while also significantly impacting your data plan consumption if not optimized.</p>
<p>There is so much opportunity for discussion between mobile network operator, API providers, developers, consumers at the data plan level. I know mobile network operators would rather keep this a black box, so they can maximize their revenue, but when you crack the network layer open with a publicly available API, there will be a number of new revenue opportunities.</p>
<p>Data plans affect all of us, every single day. We need more transparency into the algorithms that meter, limit, and charge us at the mobile data plan layer. We need the platforms we depend on each day to have more tools to optimize how applications consume (or do not consume) this extremely (seemingly) finite, and valuable resource (thanks, telcos!).&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've added an algorithms area to my research to keep an eye on this topic, curate stories I find, and share my own thoughts when it comes to algorithmic transparency using APIs.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 Aug 2016</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.airmap.com/wildfire-awareness-geofencing-drones/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/Wildfire-Screenshot-Web-App-1.png" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I have been spending a lot of time this summer thinking about how devices are being connected to the Internet, specifically when it comes to drones. As I was traveling around the countryside flying drones, I increasingly came across stories about drones being a nuisance, and most notably being a big huge problem for firefighting crews.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am flying a DJI Phantom 3 Professional drone, so <a href="http://www.dji.com/newsroom/news/dji-and-airmap-deliver-real-time-wildfire-awareness-and-geofencing-capabilities-for-drones">I was interested to see DJI recently enable real-time geofencing capabilities for drone pilots</a>. If you are unfamiliar with how these drones work, your drone controller is simply an iPad enabled joystick&nbsp;and a mobile application which becomes your control center. Before you can fly the drone the application goes through a whole series of checks making sure all of the drones variety of systems are all in check.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These drones are hyper aware of their location, maintaining a very detailed flight and activity log. The new DJI geofencing capabilities will now give you updates on wildfire, military, prison, nuclear power plants and other flight hazards via the DJI GO mobile application. DJI get's its information from <a href="https://www.airmap.com/wildfire-awareness-geofencing-drones/">airspace intelligence company Airmap</a>, who gets their information from <span>Federal Aviation Administration&nbsp;</span><a href="http://tfr.faa.gov/tfr2/list.html">Temporary Flight Restrictions</a><span>&nbsp;(TFR)</span>&nbsp;feed--all driving drone pilot(s) decision on whether it's safe to fly or not.</p>
<p><em>"GEO by default limits flights into or take-off within locations that raise safety or security concerns. If a flight within one of these locations has been authorized, GEO allows users with verified DJI accounts to temporarily unlock or self-authorize their flights. This </em>unlock<em> function is not available for sensitive national-security locations"</em>, according to the DJI Geo system overview. It is interesting to see how this update can be used as an advisory, or something that prevents the operation of a very geo-aware, and&nbsp;Internet-connected device.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the part of drone activity I find intriguing. I thoroughly enjoy flying them, but the precedent being set for potentially the future of Internet-connected devices is what I find infinitely more interesting. There are a couple of things at play here that I think are important. The fact that an Internet-connected device has the advisory&nbsp;and kill-switch like this is interesting, but also the fact that a manufacturer (Chinese one) has opted to do this on their own (maybe there is another story behind), and that a federal agency data feed can play a real time role in how devices and their operators are making decisions out in the field.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I envision this model being used even more when it comes to federal government regulation of Internet of Things devices, but also within the corporate and institutional governance lifecycle--with devices, and their operators being part of a centralized, API driven, command and control infrastructure. I have a number of stories to work through on this subject, and will keep sharing anything I come across when it comes to direct government connections to the Internet of Things like I am seeing in the drone sector.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2016/08/01/getting-back-to-api-evangelist/">Getting Back To API Evangelist</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">01 Aug 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/IMG_3539.png" alt="" width="45%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I am starting the process of getting back to work on API Evangelist, and wrapping up our&nbsp;<a href="http://dronerecovery.org">Drone Recovery</a> project. We will continue working on things throughout the summer, but I need to start looking at what's next for myself, and thanks to the API community, what I'll be doing next with API Evangelist.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks to the generosity of the API community we were able to stay afloat while spending May through July hiking the hills of Oregon. We are now spending the final months of summer and fall, getting the kid on his feet in Portland, as well as figuring out what our own next steps are. Thankfully we still have an apartment to come back to, and I have API Evangelist domain to work under--I just need to figure out what is next for this production.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There were no amazing revelations for me out in the woods. The journey just reinforced how important my work around the technology, business, and politics of APIs is to me. I enjoy paying attention to space and feel that I can continue to contribute by providing analysis that is product and vendor neutral (most of the time).</p>
<p>When it comes to APIs there are several things that keep me interested, and wanting to work on API Evangelist:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some of the people and companies in the community</li>
<li>Some of the technology being applied in API space</li>
<li>Opportunities for collaboration and transparency</li>
<li>Writing, telling my story, as well as story of others</li>
</ul>
<p>Then there are some things that I could do without when doing this work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some of the people in the community ;-(</li>
<li>The heavy focus on VC investment, acquisitions, and exits</li>
<li>Lack of critical thinking when it comes to applying technology.</li>
</ul>
<p>I do not think I'll make any significant changes to the way API Evangelist operates. I was already limiting my engagement with the companies and people that I feel do not care about the wider community. I will just keep writing and telling stories about what I think matters most when it comes to APIs, and the people, companies, institutions, agencies, and industries they are touching in 2016.</p>
<p>Thanks again to the community, for giving me the breathing room to get back on my feet in a thoughtful way, and not make any drastic decisions&nbsp;about API Evangelist, and how I will keep the lights on. I will begin slowly ramping things up here in August, getting back to my monitoring of the space, and crafting stories on the blog.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I was already doing before things shifted this summer, I will continue to pull back some of my research behind a paywall of industry guides, and other long-form content that will help support my ongoing research. The short form analysis and commentary will remain open, helping provide the regular stream of API banter that people seem to have grown accustomed to. The tone will remain the same, as the short form stories are generated as part of the conversation I have with myself about what I'm seeing in the space, and not about any particular brand, company, or approach (unless it stands out).</p>
<p>There is not much else to say. Thank you again for helping make sure my website was still here when I got back. Thanks for being so understanding when it came to disappearing on our journey this summer. I look forward to the future of API Evangelists--whatever that might look like.</p>

<p>I came out of the wilderness this week (literally, the Kalmiopsis Wilderness) to an inbox full of emails and a Twitter stream full of messages and DMs. I expected a little buzz from my exit, but not to the extent that it did, let alone the direction it took.</p>

<p>I am incredibly humbled by the community's response, and honestly, I'm not well equipped to deal with this type of attention. I know there are some folks out there who think I am some sort of attention seeker, but that is the part of all of this that I really struggle with the most. I have to step aside from myself to be able to write. Otherwise, I'm left incapacitated.</p>

<p>I am incredibly thankful for the API community. I have had the bar set pretty high for this community throughout the last six years, and you managed to raise it beyond what I had already set in my mind. I kindasorta thought some of you were reading my rants, but it kind of terrifies me now how many of you actually were.</p>

<p>Sooooooo....while I received some very fine bids on API Evangelist this week, as well as some pretty creative solutions for keeping alive and generating revenue, <a href="https://www.generosity.com/community-fundraising/the-most-important-api-call-for-kin-lane">I'm going to accept the community's bid for the domain</a>. It will remain the community's API Evangelist voice, as it has 87.34% of the time (I am a sellout, just not very good one) over the last six years -- I will just leave it as is.</p>

<p>The blog and Twitter account will remain dormant, as I will have no time to do any work. If you do have a post which you feel would be "worthy" of publishing to the blog over the summer, feel free to fork, and submit as pull request. When I come out of woods, I'll consider accepting it for publishing. If not, you will have to wait until I get my head back into tech to read anything more.</p>

<p>All the rest of the bids I received for the site, I'll have to decline. Thank you for your kind offers and will try to get everyone a short email response. That's all I got. I have enough money to get through the summer now, pay for gas, food, and the occasional campsite and motel. Oh, and some cool <a href="http://dronerecovery.org">drone equipment</a>! I have no idea what the summer holds, so I can't make any predictions for the fall -- we will see.</p>

<p>I can say, that you should <a href="https://medium.com/@njyx/priority-overflow-991fcf1e2f3#.pyf959fke">take Steve's advice in his blog post</a>, and don't take anything for granted. Especially going to the bathroom in a toilet. Don't take that for granted. It's a wonderful thing!! ;-)&nbsp;</p>

<p>It has been six years since I started API Evangelist. A personal matter has come up which will require my attention for at least six months, probably upwards of a year. Which in the tech world can be centuries--when you are dealing in real time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With this in mind, I will be putting the apievangelist.com domain, and @apievangelist Twitter account up for auction. When I come back (if I do), I'm perfectly happy starting over, and I need all the funds I can get to get me through the summer, and API Evangelist is the only asset I own.</p>
<p>I am very sorry for the impact on my business partners, but family and human beings come first, and I'm sure they will be fine. If you want the short and sweet on what I'm doing head over to kinlane.com blog, and <a href="http://dronerecovery.org/journal/drone-recovery/">if you want to follow the story of what I'm up to this summer you can head over to dronerecovery.org</a>.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;apievangelist.com&nbsp;website does over 50K page views monthly with about 30K uniques. The Twitter account has 5K followers, and growing every day--perfect for any API company. I'm taking bids for all of it to fund what I'm doing the next few months. API Evangelist is worth a lot to me, so I'm starting the bidding at 10K, and accepting the highest bidder by May 27th.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Email your bids to kinlane@gmail.com. The entire site runs on Jekyll via Github, so I can just transfer domain, and transfer the organization to you via Github. If the site does not sell, I will just leave up, and contemplate its future at a later date.</p>

<p>API management is the oldest area of my research. The area has been being defined since Mashery first opened its doors in 2006&nbsp;and continues to be defined with the recent IPO by Apigee, and the entry of AWS into the sector with the AWS API Gateway. API management is often defined by the services offered by these companies, but also by the strategies of leading API providers in the space.</p>
<p>My API management research walks through the common building blocks of the space, the open source tooling, and API service providers who are serving the space. I first started this guide in 2010 and 2011 and have worked to evolve with each release, as well as the fast pace change that seems to occur in the space.</p>
<p>This guide touches on, and often overlaps with my other areas of research (as everything was born out of this), but should provide you with what you need as a checklist for evolving your existing API management strategy, or help you craft a brand new one for your new API. This guide has a heavy focus on a service provider led approach to API management, but with the growth in open source solutions lately, I'm working to evolve more towards a DIY approach to making it work.</p>
<p>I fund my research through consulting, selling my guides, and the generous support of my sponsors. I appreciate your support in helping me continue with my work and hope you find it relevant in your API journey.</p>

<p>In the last couple of years, I've seen the concept of API design go from being something the API elite discuss, to something that involves business users, and something that has spawned a whole ecosystem of service and tooling providers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This API design research covers the concepts people often associate with API design, like REST, and Hypermedia, but also touches on other media types, API definitions, and many of the services, tooling and other solutions that have emerged to serve the space.</p>

<p>One of the things that stood out for me <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/05/10/twitter-collection-of-sarahjeong-xor-swiftstories-oracle-vs-google-coverage/">reading through the Oracle v Google trial coverage today</a>&nbsp;was Sarah Jeong's acknowledging how APIs are kind of hard to understand, and is something that is casting a shadow over the case -- something that is probably my top concern.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The whole thing where APIs are kind of hard to understand &mdash; still casting a shadow over this case</p>
&mdash; sarah jeong (@sarahjeong) <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahjeong/status/730118634828259328">May 10, 2016</a></blockquote>
<p>Also pointing out what I think is true of the Oracle legal team:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I am not entirely sure this Oracle lawyer understands what an API is, I'm not entirely sure I understand what an API is</p>
&mdash; sarah jeong (@sarahjeong) <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahjeong/status/730120248762863617">May 10, 2016</a></blockquote>
<p>While this might be more about bringing things down to a lower level for "normals", I think it still represents how difficult it is for people to grok what APIs are:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">jfc I think both sides have brought LITERAL PHYSICAL FILE CABINETS as visual aids to explain what a API is</p>
&mdash; sarah jeong (@sarahjeong) <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahjeong/status/730079061293195264">May 10, 2016</a></blockquote>
<p>Then continuing with more of the skeuomorph theater:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Google's has a big 8.5x11 printout propped up on it labeled "java.lang" and the top drawer is labeled "Math" in very big Arial Black letters</p>
&mdash; sarah jeong (@sarahjeong) <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahjeong/status/730079299353485313">May 10, 2016</a></blockquote>
<p>Then I guess we need to make some API calls? IDK</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">he literally opened the top drawer and pulled something out and waved it around to explain</p>
&mdash; sarah jeong (@sarahjeong) <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahjeong/status/730079435806801920">May 10, 2016</a></blockquote>
<p>None of which I think is helping anyone involved:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">at this point, I am not entirely sure APIs are real</p>
&mdash; sarah jeong (@sarahjeong) <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahjeong/status/730120312772157440">May 10, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
<p>I agree with with Sarah. She's a super smart chick, and if all the theater is confusing her, I can only imagine what effect it will have on the jury. What is code, what is API, what is definition, and what actually runs, or is there to enable and facilitate&nbsp;interoperability&nbsp;is blurry when you are in the game--I cannot even image anymore what it is like for the normals.</p>
<p>The only thing that keeps me optimistic in all of this is the possibility for some API literacy lessons for the masses, amidst all the theater. I guess we have to see how it goes&nbsp;and hope there are more opportunities to help folks understand what APIs actually are.</p>

<p>I am&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthit.gov/facas/sites/faca/files/SingleSourceofTruth-APITFRecommendations.pdf">reading through the API task force recommendations</a>&nbsp;out of the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC), to help address privacy and security concerns around mandated API usage as part of the Common Clinical Data Set, Medicare, and Medicaid Electronic Health Records. The recommendations contain a wealth of valuable insights around healthcare APIs but&nbsp;are&nbsp;also full of patterns that we should be applying across other sectors of our society where APIs making an impact. To help me work through the task force's recommendations, I will be blogging through many of the different concepts at play</p>
<p>In addition to highlighting&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/05/10/the-concept-of-patientdirected-apis/">the usage of "patient-directed&nbsp;APIs" that I wrote about earlier</a>, and taking <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/05/10/a-healthy-stance-on-privacy-and-security-when-it-comes-to-healthcare-apis/">a healthy stance on privacy and security when it comes to healthcare APIs</a>, I wanted to separate out the conversation around a patent's right to access their own personal health information, and how APIs are being used as the enabler. Here is the chapter from the task force's recommendations:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Many of the discussions within the task force centered around the notion that the patient directed app of our purview supports the patient&rsquo;s HIPAA right to access his/her own PHI from a Covered Entity, as required under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/45/164.502">HIPAA &sect; 164.502</a>. </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>This could be characterized in several ways:</em></p>
<ol style="padding-left: 20px;">
<li><em>the individual requesting access to their information</em></li>
<li><em>an entity designated by the individual to receive a copy of PHI (as part of the individual exercising his/her right to access PHI)</em></li>
<li><em>the medium on which the individual requests that PHI be provided or transmitted as part of the individual exercising his/her right to obtain a copy of PHI</em></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em> Alternatively, the patient directed app may also be characterized as a third party formerly authorized by the individual to receive PHI or a tool for engaging the individual in treatmentEach of these scenarios creates challenges when attempting to determine oversight of an app&rsquo;s behavior there is not one clear solution.</em></p>
<p>I am going to educate myself about <em><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/45/164.502">HIPAA &sect; 164.502</a></em>, and get to work understanding what other precedents exist--maybe with <a href="http://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html">FERPA</a> or <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/complying-coppa-frequently-asked-questions">COPPA</a>, or other similarly regulated industries. I am just looking to understand where the lines are drawn when it comes to people having a "right to access" when it comes to their data, especially when APIs are playing a central role like they are with healthcare interoperability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have read the healthcare API task force recommendations several times now, but I am only a couple pages into when it comes to cherry picking ideas I want to consider more deeply, as well as have indexed as part of my overall API industry research. So stay tuned for continued posts about how APIs are being used to drive patient-centered&nbsp;access to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">their</span> healthcare data.</p>

<p>The next round of the Oracle v Google Java API Copyright battle has kicked off again in San Francisco after being sent back to the lower court by the United States Supreme Court. This round is all about deciding if Google's usage of the Java API in their Android platform was allowed under fair use. If I was in San Francisco I would be there to hear the case first hand--I am lucky there are some really smart folks covering the case&nbsp;and live tweeting things.</p>
<p>I went through the Tweets from&nbsp;Sarah Jeong (<a href="https://twitter.com/sarahjeong">@sarahjeong</a>), contributing editor at @Motherboard, Parker Higgins (<a href="https://twitter.com/xor">@xor</a>), EFF activist, and Mike Swift (<a href="https://twitter.com/Swiftstories">@Swiftstories</a>), Senior Correspondent for MLex. They are all providing some smart, and pretty amusing commentary on what is going on, so I wanted to organize the relevant Tweets into a Twitter collection summary for inclusion in my research.&nbsp;</p>
<div align="center" style="width: 60%; border: 0px solid #000; margin-left: 135px;">
  <a class="twitter-timeline" href="https://twitter.com/kinlane/timelines/730194899920932864" data-widget-id="730232433828724736">Oracle v Google </a>

</div>
<p>I will add more tweets to it each day of the trial, and since it's a Twitter collection, it will update here on the blog post, or if you'd rather,<a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane/timelines/730194899920932864">you can access it directly&nbsp;via Twitte</a>r. I have no idea how long this round of the case will play out, but I will definitely be tuning in, and ranting about it when I have time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know if there is anyone else covering the trial, that I should be including in the Twitter collection. I want to try and capture as complete of a record as possible, from multiple perspectives if possible. While I am bummed that the precedent for copyright has been established for APIs, I'm hopeful that we can look at this round as an API literacy opportunity. ;-)</p>

<p><span>One phrase that is used regularly across the task force recommendations that really caught my attention was the concept of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><em>"PatientDirected APIs"</em></strong></span>. It is a powerful concept, when you think about APIs existing, not just for helping integrate healthcare systems, and innovate around the development and delivery of the web and mobile applications, but doing it all because of, in service of, and at the direction of the patient. The document has grabbed my attention because this is the first time I've seen such an end-user focused API vision in the wild.</span></p>
<p><span>While these electronic healthcare record APIs will be used for system integration, delivering web and mobile apps, and benefiting healthcare platform operators, and developers, the reason for the APIs will be existing is to benefit the patient. This just isn't how things are done in Silicon Valley, where you always focus on benefits for the platform, its partners and investors first, maybe the developers secondarily, but in most cases the end-user is just an afterthought. In startup culture, things are just turned on its head, allowing for some serious imbalance in how we do things with APIs.</span></p>
<p><span>There are a wealth of topics for me to work through from the task force recommendations out of ONC and HHS. I will keep blogging, as I read through, and work through the important recommendations it contains. Once I have my head wrapped around the document more, and up to speed with&nbsp;what they are doing, I'm hoping I can contribute some more ideas that might help stimulate things as healthcare providers roll out their APIs.</span></p>

<p>How we define our APIs has dramatically changed in recent years. Since Swagger came onto the scene around five years ago, there has been a rapid growth in the number of open formats, tooling, and services to help us define APIs. Companies are using API definitions like OpenAPI Spec, Postman, and API.json to communicate about their APIs at almost every stop along the API life cycle. This is my research to better understand all the moving parts in this fast growing sector.</p>
<p><a href="http://apis.how/oq38yeqkkd">This guide</a> focuses on API definition formats like OpenAPI Spec and API Blueprint, as well as schema formats like JSON Schema, and MSON, but I also touch on media types, link relations and other common building blocks for defining our APIs so they speak a common language. While there is some open tooling included in this guide, I'm trying to focus on the specifications, and formats themselves, and help make sense of the amount of information available to us.</p>

        <span class="post-date">10 May 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-smoke-and-mirrors.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I get brought into a lot of API discussions with IT departments from companies, institutions, and government agencies, which are often coordinated by business groups who are interested in better meeting their goals using APIs. This is often an immediately charged conversation, with IT coming to their table with a whole array of baggage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In about 75% of the situations, IT, and developer representatives are nice, or rather they are tight-lipped, relying on a myriad of smoke &amp; mirrors to defend their dark arts. Let me stop for a moment, and put out there that I was IT director from 1998 through 2010. I'm not saying IT are bad people, but there are a wide variety of ways we slow, obfuscate, and distort the conversation to be in our favor -- takes one to know one. I wouldn't say that I was 100% honest in my approach to being an IT leader, but I tried my hardest to keep things as transparent as I possibly could.</p>
<p>Anyways, in a couple of the &nbsp;IT discussions I've had lately, there was an OpenAPI Spec available to define the resources that were on the table, and in a handful of other conversation there were not. Keep in mind that most of these scenarios are with a more traditional version of IT, not with startup technology groups (a whole different beast). As I step back, I am taking notice of the harmonizing effect that an API definition can have, in keeping conversations focused, productive, and moving forward toward a common goal.</p>
<p>In the conversations without an OpenAPI Spec, back-end systems and legacy processes dominated the discussion, even though we are all on a conference call to discuss an external, partner, and public facing API. In the discussions where an OpenAPI Spec was present, we focused on exactly which resources were needed (nothing more), and the details (params, responses, etc) that were needed by all consumers--essentially providing us with a scaffolding for the discussion, that kept things moving forward, and not bogged down in legacy sludge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Backend focused discussions&nbsp;always seemed to get slowed down by what was, and what is. The API definition focused conversations seemed to focus on what was needed, using a common language that everyone at the table understood. The presence of an OpenAPI Spec seemed to cut through the smoke &amp; mirrors, which I think often alienates many of the business users. I find having three versions of an OpenAPI Spec and APIs.json file present: 1) simple outline 2) YAML and 3) JSON, was also something that significantly improved discussions, keeping conversations focused while also making them as inclusive as possible.</p>
<p>I think people will always bring their baggage to these discussions, but I'm liking the harmonization effects API definitions like OpenAPI Spec, API Blueprint, Postman, and APIs.json are having in&nbsp;these conversations. I'm hopeful that these API definitions can continue providing bridges between business and IT groups, helping close a canyon that has existed for decades.</p>

When it comes to making data, content, and other digital resources available online, I hear the full spectrum of concerns, and it leaves me optimistic to hear government agencies speak about security and privacy in such a balanced way.</p>
<p>Here is a section from the API task force recommendations:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Like any technology, APIs allow new capabilities and opportunities and, like any other technology, these opportunities come with some risks. There are fears that APIs may open new security vulnerabilities, with apps accessing patient records "for evil", and without receiving proper patient authorization. There are also fears that APIs could provide a possible "fire hose" of data as opposed to the "one sip at a time" access that a web site or email interface may provide.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In testimony, we heard almost universally that, when APIs are appropriately managed, the opportunities outweigh the risks. We heard from companies currently offering APIs that properly managed APIs provide better security properties than ad-hoc interfaces or proprietary integration technology.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">While access to health data via APIs does require additional considerations and regulatory compliance needs, we believe existing standards, infrastructure, and identity proofing processes are adequate to support patient directed access via APIs today.</p>
<p>The document is full of recommendations on how to strike this balance. It is refreshing to hear such a transparent vision of what APIs can be. They weigh the risks, alongside the benefits that APIs bring to the table&nbsp;while also being fully aware that a "properly managed API" provides its own security. Another significant aspect of these recommendations for me is that they also touch on the role that APIs will play in the regulatory and a compliance process.</p>
<p>I have to&nbsp;admit, the area of healthcare APIs isn't one of the most exciting stacks in the over 50 areas I track on across the API space, but I'm fully engaged with this because of the potential of a blueprint for privacy and security that can be applied with other types of APIs. When it comes to social, location, and other data the bar has been set pretty low when it comes to privacy and security, but health care&nbsp;data is different. People tend to be more concerned with access, security, privacy, and all the things we should already be discussing when it comes to the rest of our digital existence--opening the door for some valuable digital literacy discussions.</p>
<p>Hopefully, I don't run you off with all my healthcare API stories, and you can find some gems in the healthcare API task force's recommendations, like I am.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/05/07/twilio-provides-test-api-credentials-with-magic-phone-numbers/">I wrote a post about Twilio using magic phone numbers that let their developers test out functionality without incurring any charges for deploying live phone numbers, making calls, and sending SMS</a>. After publishing my post, Runscope CEO, John Sheehan (<a href="https://twitter.com/johnsheehan">@johnsheehan</a>) said he was behind the original spec for the Twilio magic numbers.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane">@kinlane</a> ha I wrote the magic numbers spec. The implementation was better than my design but it&rsquo;s funny to see it recognized so much later</p>

<p>John&nbsp;continued to share some of the logic that went into his original spec:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane">@kinlane</a> I borrowed the idea from payment processors using magic numbers to generate specific kinds of outcomes like declines</p>

<p>Which I think adds another dimension to the concept of having test numbers like this. Different numbers give you different outcomes, and different credit card numbers give you different results. What else could you do with test numbers&nbsp;and unique identifiers? Existing invoice and order numbers for different commerce situations. Seems like you could load just about anything into any alpha and / or numeric that you would want to.</p>
<p>Around the turn of the century (I don't think I've ever said that) I used to work on web applications for non-profit organizations where I used to build campaign code tracking for large, and lengthy mail, phone, fax, and other types of activities. We had 6 to 8 digit identifiers, which every two digits had unique meanings--allowing us to build a pretty robust set of scenarios that helped us track every step in the campaigns evolution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyways, I think the concept is worthy of further exploration. I could see API providers crafting a pretty robust set of keys that could represent almost any object served up as part of API operations, with a very structured approach for how you tailor a multitude outcomes involving these objects. For me, this type of stuff goes way beyond just having a sandbox for your API, and could provide a much more meaningful way help developers polish their integrations.</p>

<p>As I push out stories on the next round of the Oracle v Google API copyright case, considering how I will write about API deprecations and acquisitions I'm privy to, and document the continued march by the enterprise into the world of APIs -- I begin to see how APIs will continue to wither on the vine, and never reach their full potential in an increasingly&nbsp;toxic&nbsp;environment.</p>
<p>The Oracle v Google is just the first of many battles to occur between tech giants when it comes to APIs&nbsp;and the application of intellectual property laws. With the number of patents out there that focus on APIs as the thing that is protected by IP, not just the thing behind the API being protected, the copyright of the common API patterns&nbsp;we enjoy&nbsp;will just be the tip of the iceberg. This is how the giants will battle it out, leaving the rest of us fighting for scraps in the cracks.</p>
<p>Legal tussle like what we see between Oracle&nbsp;and Google will become commonplace in the future as the enterprise&nbsp;fights for what they think is their&nbsp;"property" when it comes to integrations, collaboration, sharing, and automation. These battles will take place after this current wave of "interest in APIs" by the enterprise, where these large entities have sent their scouts out to map this uncharted (and mildly threatening) wilderness, understand what everyone is doing, and file patents based on what they see. Simplifying enterprise operations, actually innovating, or truly achieving integration is&nbsp;farthest from their mind. While we are all busy doing the work, these IP cartographers are mapping out the exhaust from our labor.</p>
<p>Alongside all of this, another shift in the winds is occurring, that will reduce some very useful, innovative, and valuable API patterns to just portfolio items of the enterprise. As VC funding cycles shift, the startups who are doing the most interesting things with APIs will have their work gobbled up by the enterprise, either through direct acquisitions, or fire sales -- in any case APIs are IP, nothing more. These winds are strong, and will not just blow away the valuable APIs, but also much of the shade trees that is needed for other APIs to flourish on the vine.</p>
<p>All of this change will sweep up this API experiment&nbsp;as we know it, into the IP portfolios of the enterprise giants, so they can use as leverage in court battles, and venture negotiations of the future. The enablement that APIs bring to the table is just too small of a thing currently for the enterprise to even see. Startups are often too greedy, or beholden to their investors to understand the opportunity they are passing on&nbsp;when they see APIs as intellectual property. API enablement is not IP, the thing they enable is IP, and by freezing up the enabling factor, you will miss out on your IP ever reaching full potential, and will be left with a vineyard of perpetually green grapes.</p>
<p>I know, I know. All my enterprise and startup friends will tell me how naive I am, and this is how business is done. Again, I will say, you are so blinded by your greed, and your belief in this broken IP systems, you are willing to kill off this very interesting experiment--where we all &nbsp;had a seat at the table. At this point, I am left without any hope, and the concept of APIs as we know it will wither on the vine, never reaching their full potential -- this API economy thing we all saw in our minds eye, will not happen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I'm gonna still keep on fighting, and pushing for APIs usage in healthcare, education, government, and other important areas. I will keep building services and tools that embrace APIs as their core, but you will rarely hear me speak of the bright, API enabled future anymore. The experiment is over, the believers in a broken IP system are winning -- they just have too much money, and resources to play the long game, and the wider API space, and the rest of us will lose out.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 May 2016</span>
        <p>I'm spending a lot of time in the Twilio API ecosystem this week, so you will hear multiple stories about what they are up to. This one is highlighting their <a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/rest/call-feedback">Call Feedback API</a> and the growing amount of what I'd consider as infrastructure APIs from leading API platforms. The more API platforms mature, the more I see APIs deployed to assist API consumers manage their integrations, as well as get a the core API resources being made available.</p>
<p>Twilio's feedback API focuses on a single API resource, a call, but could just as easily be applied equally as a quality of service feedback endpoint for anything you are serving up, like video, bot responses, recommendations, and beyond. I like the idea of having one endpoint for serving up a resource, and another endpoint for reporting the quality of service around the resource.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/twilio-call-feedback-api.png" alt="" width="98%" /></p>
<p>Now that I have filed a report on Twilio's approach to using APIs as part of their platform operations, I will be keeping a closer eye out for other platforms doing similar things. I will consider adding it to my stack of existing API infrastructure APIs, alongside access to account, application, billing, and analytics via an API.</p>
<p>As the growth of API integration continues, I will continue looking at the API pioneers for examples of how we can be providing more infrastructure focused API resources, that allow API consumers to manage, orchestrate, and automate their API integrations. As developers use a larger number of APIs to drive any single application or system integration, the need to automate accounts, apps, pricing, billing, analytics and feedback loops is only going to grow.</p>

        <span class="post-date">08 May 2016</span>
        <p>One thing I look at closely when I review API platforms&nbsp;is how they approach the monetization of their API resources, and the resulting plans, pricing, and access tiers. How platforms think about, and present this aspect of their operations provide a wealth of insights into what a company's motivations are behind their API operations.</p>
<p>I found the approach by <a href="https://i.materialise.com/api/docs/upload-model-api/">3D printing API platform i.materialise</a>&nbsp;to be an interesting approach which goes beyond just charging for API access and focuses on helping API consumers align their business model with i.materialises. i.materialise presents API consumers with two possible routes, with the first being referral based, and the second being a deeper, white label relationship.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/imaterialise-business-models.png" alt="" width="95%" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://i.materialise.com/api/">i.materialise API provides consumers with access to a &nbsp;full stack of 3D printing APIs</a>, allowing you to upload your model, determine what it will cost to print, all the way to assisting you with order fulfillment, delivery, and invoicing. The i.materialise approach to API monetization is different than other APIs I talk about because it's not about paying for API access. In this situation, it's about providing API access to the manufacturing life cycle -- one that is 3D printer driven.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While I think utility-based, pay as you go API pricing represent the majority of how we approach API consumption at the moment, I think having your business model aligned, and focused on existing, tangible products and services holds a huge amount of untapped potential for APIs. I'm thinking there are endless numbers of small business out there who would benefit from the process of mapping out their product supply chain&nbsp;and service lifecycles, then the opening up of things as a simple web API--even if it is just for internal, and trusted partner use.</p>

        <span class="post-date">07 May 2016</span>
        <p>I am always on the hunt for the little things that make API integration easier, and while <a href="http://theapistack.com/certifying/">working to certify my Twilio API definition</a>, I noticed their <a href="https://www.twilio.com/user/account/phone-numbers/dev-tools/test-credentials">test credentials</a>. When you are playing with the Twilio API, it's pretty easy to add new keys, and create new apps, but they also offering test credentials along with what they call "Twilio's Magic Numbers" so that you can play without connecting to real phones or making actual charges on your account.</p>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/twilio-test-credentials.png" alt="" width="100%" /></p>
<p>Many APIs provide you access to data or content, but Twilio enters the additional realm of much more complex, programmatic API resources. When getting up and going with these types of APIs, it really helps to have a sandbox to play in, and a ready to go set of test credentials provides this for users by default.</p>
<p>If you are offering up more than just data and content, via your API, you may want to follow Twilio's lead, and create a set of permanent, or even regularly changing set of test accounts for consumers to use. It made my onboarding with Twilio, significantly easier.</p>

<p>I am sure there is some equation we could come up to describe the amount of ideology and / or dogma present alongside each bit and byte of code. Something that exponentially increases with each additional line of code or MB on disk. An example of this in action, in the wilds of the API space, is the difference between an SDK for an API, and just a single sample API call.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The single API sample is the minimum viable artifact that enables you to get value from an API -- allowing you to make a single API request and receive a single API response. Very little ideology, or dogma present (its there, but just smaller quantities). Now, if an API provider provides you with a Laravel SDK in PHP, or a JAX-RS SDK in Java, and React.js SDK, I'm significantly cranking up the volume on ideology&nbsp;and dogma involved with this code. All contributing what type of technical debt I'm willing to assume along the way, with each of one my API integrations, and wider technological solutions.</p>
<p>I work hard to never hold up any single technology as an absolute solution, as there are none, but I can see a potential for the latest wave of "serverless" approaches to delivering code potentially helping us unwind some of our technical debt. Like most other areas of technology, simply choosing to go "serverless" will not provide you the relief you need, but if you are willing to do the hard work to decouple your existing code, and apply the philosophy consistently to future projects, the chances "serverless" might pay dividends in the reduction of your technical debt will increase greatly.</p>

<p>I am doing way more work on the creation of machine-readable OpenAPI Specs for APIs, indexed using machine-readable APIs.json&nbsp;files than I am the actual creation of APIs lately. About <a href="http://theapistack.com/">half of the API definitions I create are for existing APIs</a>, with <a href="http://schema.org.apis.apievangelist.com/">the rest of them describing APIs that should exist</a>. With the existing APIs, in some cases, I am creating client-side code, but mostly just focusing on a well crafted API definition. When it comes to the new API designs, I am focusing on a complete API definition, but also crafting both server-side, as well as client-side code around the definition--when needed.</p>
<p>Even when I do craft server or client code for an API definition, the value of the code is significantly lower than the definition(s). In my mind the code is disposable. I want to be able to throw it away, and start over with anything I am building, at any point. While I have made significant ideological investments into using Linux for my OS, AWS for my compute and storage hosting, MySQL for my database, and PHP + Slim for my API deployment framework, the code that operates within this framework has to be transient. Some code might end up having a long, long life, but if a piece of code isn't generating value, and in the way, I want to either get rid of it or rewrite it to better meet the requirements.</p>
<p>When it comes to delivering technology in my world, my investments are increasingly in the API definitions, underlying data schemas, and the data and content that is actually stored and transmitted within. The PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML is valuable, but a second class citizen to the JSON, and YAML representations of my APIs, schemas, and the valuable data and content stored. For me personally, having made significant investments in a variety of tech solutions historically, this provides me with the flexibility I need to live in the current online climate. This is something that only has been coming into focus in the last year, so I assume it will also continue to evolve in focus over the next couple of years, but I am already seeing significant returns from my investing in definitions over the code when it comes to my API strategy.</p>

<p>There are many different ways to actually deploy an API. If you are a larger, more established company, you probably have existing&nbsp;tools, services, and processes set forth by IT for deploying APIs. If you are a startup, your developers probably have their own frameworks, or possibly a cloud service they prefer using. <a href="http://apis.how/luztdufwj0">This guide looks to map out the world of API deployment</a>, and some of the common ways companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies are deploying APIs in 2016.</p>
<p>This <a href="http://apis.how/luztdufwj0">API deployment guide</a> breaks out many of the common companies, and tools while also looking to identify some of the common building blocks employed by leading providers, in support of API deployment across organizations of all shapes and sizes. This research is conducted by API Evangelist and is the just aspect of a modern API lifecycle, one that includes over 50 stops, from API design to deprecation, with deployment being just one area you should be considering.</p>

<p>I have been tracking on <a href="http://university.stack.network/">how APIs are used in higher education</a> for some time now, keeping an eye on almost <a href="http://university.stack.network/universities/">50 campus API related efforts</a>. I have my <a href="http://apis.how/qxhdqghp4a">University API guide</a>&nbsp;that I regularly update, but I was eager to push forward my storytelling around what is going on, so I have been working on some papers telling the story behind some of the top higher ed API implementations which I have access to.</p>
<p>What better way to kick this off, than to showcase my favorite campus API group, over at <a href="https://home.byu.edu/home/">Brigham Young University (BYU)</a>. The team led by CIO Kelly Flanagan (<a href="https://twitter.com/kelflanagan">@kelflanagan</a>) have embraced APIs on campus in a way that keeps my excited about APIs, and what is possible. In my opinion, BYU isn't just using APIs to shift IT strategy at the school, they are using APIs to shift how their students and faculty see technology, and put it to work on their terms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm pretty familiar with what has been happening at BYU when it comes to APIs, as I see Kelly and his team regularly, but I jumped on a Google Hangout with them, so that I could get the latest. The results is a short five page essay, about the history of the API efforts on campus, some of the benefits to faculty and students, and a glimpse at the future of APIs at the school.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://apis.how/adazaak60a">The paper is freely available for you to download as PDF</a>, but I will also be working on some stories that I used&nbsp; the paper, as part of my regularly blogging here on API Evangelist. I want to keep bringing attention to what they are up to at BYU, but also generate attention at other schools about what is possible when it comes to APis. As I note in the paper, I'm also working with Davidson College in North Carolina, and will be working to keep spreading the conversation to other schools.</p>
<p>You can find me speaking at University of California in San Diego this June, so stay tuned for more information about how APIs are used in higher ed this summer--showcasing my conversations with BYU, Davidson, and UCSD, as examples of how APIs are making an impact in higher education.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 May 2016</span>
        <p><a href="http://theapistack.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-stacks.png" alt="" width="35%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I am always working as hard as I can to develop as complete as possible OpenAPI Specs for the APIs that I monitor. I call this <a href="http://theapistack.com/">my API Stack research</a>. When possible, in addition to mapping out API operations for an API using <a href="http://apisjson.org">APIs.json</a>, I also work to create a machine readable OpenAPI Spec for each API.</p>
<p>In most cases I only have the time to profile the surface area of an API -- the host, base url, all properties, and required parameters. I don't always have time to reach what I'd consider to be a complete API definition. This is something that takes authenticating, achieving a successful request and response for each endpoint present, then generating JSON schema for each response -- this takes a significant amount of effort to do properly.</p>
<p>Thankfully in addition to investing in this work myself, I am also getting the assistance of my partners like&nbsp;<a href="http://apis.how/bgdteovduo">Dream Factory</a>, who are interested in getting specific API definitions completed, and make sure they have complete API definitions for the leading APIs out there today. Here are a handful of them I'm working on producing this week:</p>

<p>I've assigned each API its own Github repo to store the OpenAPI Specs, as well as indexing them using APIs.json, and facilitating the conversation using the Github issues. My goal is to streamline the process of making sure all the endpoints are represented, and a complete definition for both the request and the response exists--while keeping an eye on the future, in a potentially crowd sourced, Github-centric way.</p>
<p>If there is an API you'd like to see get completed, let me know. I am happy to prioritize other APIs after this. My goals it to focus a dedicated amount of time each week to this, but unfortunately this takes money, so I'm looking to get investment from partners, and the general community to help make sure happens. If you want to help, feel free to ping me, and let me know what you need.</p>

<p><a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/05/02/http-header-awareness-using-the-link-header-for-pagination/">I was learning more about using the Link header for pagination yesterday</a>, as part of<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/31/gathering-my-thoughts-about-open-referral-and-the-human-services-api/"> my work on the Human Services Data Specification (HSDS)</a>, and this approach to putting hypermedia links in the header got me thinking about other possibilities. Part of the reason I was considering using the Link header for pagination on this particular project was that I was looking to alter the existing schema as little as possible -- I liked that I could augment the response with links, using the header.</p>
<p>Another side thought I had along the way were around the possibilities for using it to augment 3rd party APIs, and APIs from an external vantage point. It wouldn't be too hard route API requests through a proxy, which could add a header with a personalized set of links tailored for each API request. If the request was looking up flights, the links could be to value add services that might influence the decision like links to hotels, events, and other activities. If you were looking up the definition of a word, the links could be to synonyms--endless possibilities.</p>
<p>You wouldn't have to just use it for pagination, and other common link relations, you could make it more about discovery, search, or even serendipity injected from outside sources. Anyways, I think the fact that you can augment an existing response using a header opens up a lot of possibilities for adding hypermedia behaviors to existing APIs. It might also be an interesting way to introduce existing API owners to hypermedia concepts, by showing them the value that can be added when you provided valuable links.</p>

<p>As <a href="http://theapistack.com/">my API Stack</a> work gets more attention, folks are reaching out to me to see if I have done certain APIs, or see if I'd prioritize some of the ones already on the list. One thing I'm also noticing is that people are often looking for the JSON schema of each of the API responses, just as much as they are looking for the OpenAPI Spec for the API surface area.</p>
<p>I had someone looking for the <a href="http://stack.apievangelist.com/companies.html">complete schema for the Reddit API</a> today, while I was&nbsp;<a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/05/02/working-to-establish-a-complete-openapi-spec-for-leading-apis/">working to authenticate, and record the responses to each endpoint for&nbsp;AngelList, AlchemyAPI, CenturyLink, NTT Docomo, Stripe, Twilio, and Verizon</a>. An OpenAPI Spec for the request structure of an API will get you a long ways in on boarding and learning about an API, but you will need the schema to complete any integration.</p>
<p>This is one of the reason I'm working to establish a better process for certifying that an OpenAPI Spec is complete, because without the definitions, providing a JSON schema, will only get you part way--still so much work to be done. This is why API service providers are looking to have it defined, because a complete spec is what will be used to map to other systems, tools, and services.</p>
<p><a href="http://schema.org.apis.apievangelist.com/">After spending a couple days going through Schema.org</a>, and working on the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/31/gathering-my-thoughts-about-open-referral-and-the-human-services-api/">Human Services Data Specification (HSDS)</a>, I'm feeling the gravity of having common, machine readable schema available for the industry to work from. I've spent a number of cycles in the last two years creating OpenAPI Specs for APIs, but often stopping short of requiring the JSON schema to be present. From here forward, I will equally prioritize the response schema --it is proving to be just as valuable as the response described using OpenAPI Spec.</p>

        <span class="post-date">02 May 2016</span>
        <p><a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/#pagination"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/github-link-header.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I was revisiting the concept of pagination for a specific project I am working, and after consulting my API research, I came up with a suitable approach using a Link Header. Beyond applying this in my specific project, I thought the usage of the header for pagination would be a suitable topic for helping with HTTP header awareness -- a topic I will be writing about regularly, to help folks be more aware of useful approaches to using HTTP headers.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/#pagination">Github has the best example of using the link header for pagination that I could find</a>. Github uses the&nbsp;Link response header to hold a handful of Hypermedia link relations including next, last, first, and prev. Providing a nice way to handle not just pagination, but potentially any other related action you might want to take around an API response. It also provides a way to augment link relations to any existing API design, without adding to the actual response body -- which is one reason I decided to use it for my existing project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>HTTP headers are a critical aspect of API integration, and an area that I feel many developers are lacking awareness of. Which is why I will be working harder to write up simple uses like Link header for pagination, that can help API providers, as well as API consumers better use common HTTP header patterns. To be clear, the Link header is not unique to Github, and is something that is <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988#page-6">articulated in RFC 5988 for web linking</a>. Something I will add as a tooling to my API design research, so it can be considered as part of an overall <a href="http://design.apievangelist.com">API design toolbox</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">30 Apr 2016</span>
        <p>I was playing with <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/catalog/">Microsoft's API Catalog</a>, a tool to visualize and analyze the API overlap between standards specifications and type systems within browsers, and their footer caught my eye. I am always looking for quality examples of companies doing platform communications and support well, and I think their layout, and <a href="http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks/">available building blocks</a> in their footer, is worthy of showcasing.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/catalog/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/api-monitoring-microsoft.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>For me, these numbers, and the available communication and support building blocks, send the right signals--that a platform is alive and active. These are the data points I tune into, to understand how well a platform is doing, or not doing. There are no absolutes when it comes to this type of monitoring, as anything can be gamed, but sign Github activity, road map evolution, and blog storytelling can provide a vital heartbeat for any healthy API platform.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We are picking up speed with the planning for <a href="http://boston2016.apistrat.com/">@APIStrat in Boston this November</a>, and with the <a href="http://boston2016.apistrat.com/program-committee/">event committee assembled</a>, and the <a href="http://boston2016.apistrat.com/call-for-talks/">call for talks open</a>, we are looking at what the possible topics are for sessions. We have seeded the list with the usual suspects like API design, management, testing, monitoring, and others, but we want to also consider what the alternative topics are, and what is relevant to the API sector in 2016.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is most important to you in 2016? Is it the trendier topics like bots, voice, and IoT? Is it more practical things like evangelism, versioning, and discovery? Is it the technical, business, or politics of APIs that are impacting your operations most in 2016? If you want to come and present on it, <a href="http://boston2016.apistrat.com/call-for-talks/">make sure you submit your talk by May 20th</a>. Otherwise you are welcome to <a href="https://twitter.com/apistrat">tweet at us</a>, <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0e6f7e677d7a7c6f7a4e3d7d6d6f626b20606b7a">email at us</a>, write a blog post, commit to a Github repo, or any other way you desire--we'll add into the mix, for the event committee to review.</p>
<p>It is a lot of work to make sure @APIStrat keeps reflecting the wider API movement after 3 years, and we depend on you keeping us informed. I'm enjoying the fact that we are only doing one event this year, as it is giving us more lead time to engage in discussions with the community, and continue making it an inclusive event. Another thing I'd like to hear about from y'all, is what is relevant to Boston, something I'm sure I will learn more about as I continue my profiling of Boston area businesses.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The relationship between API provider and consumer is a fragile one. As an API provider I am offering up my valuable digital asset, data, content, and digital resources. I would like you to take this Application Programming Interface or SDK that I have built, and put it in your business systems and applications. As an API consumer, I'm given access to valuable business API asset, which I'm expected use in a respectful way, that is always in alignment with a providers terms of service -- an environment where so much can go wrong, and does each day.</p>
<p>I watch companies take a wide range of tones when it comes to setting the stage for this relationship. Some companies are super protective of their valuable content (like Marvel Comics), some are very communicative and inviting like Slack (inject your bot into us). where others wobble between a more open, the back to strict, like Twitter has done over the last couple years. In my opinion, it comes down to how you see your digital resources, and your belief in intellectual property -- when I you, I mean you and your investors.</p>
<p>I try NOT to read all the patent notifications that come into my reader, as it fucking depresses me, but everyone once in a while I have to revisit to help remind everyone, what an illness patents will be, when it comes to APIs working. This fragile relationship I speak of above, operates well, or not very well, depending on how loose, or how much friction exists at this layer. There are plenty of examples out there of APIs who do not do well when they restrict, or too heavily meter API consumers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help build an image in your mind. Imagine the Twitter API, and all the apps that have been built on it. OK, now add in Stripe for payments, Dropbox for storage, Instagram for Images, Facebook for Social, Amazon EC2 for compute, and YouTube for videos. Now, think about enforcing copyright on every API design, and patent licensing on each process involved. It will grind these billion dollar revenue engines to a screeching halt. Nobody will build on these platforms if they have to bake your legal heavy design, and process into their business.</p>
<p>Modern web APIs are balance between the technical, business, and politics of how data, content, and algorithms are exchanged. Simple, ubiquitous web technology is working on the technical side of things. Simple, pay as you go, utility based, and tiered access is helping strike balance on the business side of things. TOS, privacy, security, transparency are the knobs and dials of the political side of things, let's not willingly invite in something so invasive, like patents into the API layer. Patent your algorithm, copyright your content, and license your data, but keep the API definition copyright free, and your API process patent free.</p>
<p>In the <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=9,280,678.PN.&amp;OS=PN/9,280,678&amp;RS=PN/9,280,678">"secure cloud storage distribution and aggregation"</a> patent I'm reading this morning, its not the patent that offends me. It is the patent being so focused on the API being the thing that makes the patent. Patent how you index, search, and secure your file storage wizardry, but the API design, and operations should NOT be a focal point of your patent. You want people to integrate with your "secure cloud storage distribution and aggregation", bake the API design and process into their businesses, you want the cloud storage industry to speak your API -- don't lock it down, otherwise API consumers will look elsewhere.</p>

        <span class="post-date">28 Apr 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-storytelling.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+MikeAmundsen/posts/9d8QTVVDuJd">I was reminded by my friend Mike Amundsen of the importance of storytelling in our world</a>. When I am asked by anyone doing APIs, what is the most important thing they should be doing, my answer is always "storytelling". I don't care if its internally, publicly, on the corporate blog, or your personal blog, tell the story of what you are doing. I do not care how good your API is, if you aren't telling the story of this, nobody is going to care.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I hold up storytelling as the most important tool in your toolbox within developer groups, they often snicker, dismissing it. I also have a contingent of my NOT fanbase in the API space who love to dismiss me with -- nobody reads or cares about stories! I'm never phased by these folks, my focus is on the people who are truly trying to build community, and reach their intended audience. #NoHaterz</p>
<p>While stories swirl all around is many forms, the one I like to reference the most, is when it comes to the mating ritual that is startup funding. If you are looking to get funding for your startup, you have to be sending the right signals, otherwise your VC mate will never be interested in you. You will need to be on TechCrunch, Venture Beat, and other tech blogs. Hacker News, Reddit and Hacker News needs to be in sync. Your stories should also be in sync with what is floating around VC firm blogs, aggregate, and other investor related streams.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Startup valuations are are defined by an ocean of stories crashing on the shore each day. Bots are a thing because of storytelling. We are focusing on selling to the enterprise and abandoning B2C solutions because of storytelling. Google loves them some moonshot storytelling. Elon Musk understand the importance of the right story at the right time. Stories of what people are using. Stories of what people are investing in. Stories of what the future will hold, and will be a 20B industry by 2020.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is marketing Kin! I'd put it in the fiction section of the library if I was in charge, but I'm not. Its all storytelling. If you need another example, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/">visit my secret to Amazon's success post</a>. This story does 2K page views a month, and I've seen it referenced in keynotes, framed on the wall of a bank, and on the home page of a federal agencies internal portal. This story is more fiction than it is fact, yet it keeps on resonating with folks, getting passed around, and turning people on to the concept of APIs, and why they are important.</p>
<p>Please keep telling your story, if for no other reason, so that I have stories to retell. ;-)</p>

<p><a href="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/?doc">I came across the Wikimedia Unique Devices data set, which also is served up as an API endpoint, along with the other APIs the platform offers</a>. The data set and API provides access to a list of unique devices that have visited Wikipedia, for a specific period of time.</p>
<p>The data set and API only has data back to January currently, but I'm sure is something that will evolve over time. I really like the fact that we have organizations who are operating at scale, and are open and willing to share their data. This type of information is high value, and is something that can help us all better understand the ever shifting digital landscape around us--thank you Wikimedia for making accessible.</p>
<p>While playing with their <a href="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/?doc">Unique Device API</a>, I also noticed how transparent they are with their page view data, also making it available as simple set of API endpoints. I know Wikimedia is a non-profit, but I can't help but feel their way of doing things provides a blueprint that other commercial platforms should consider following.</p>

<p>I am <a href="http://apis.how/3bjch3csvo">working with my partner Cloud Elements</a> to build out a community of evangelists, who are interested in delivering on <a href="http://evangelism.apievangelist.com/building-blocks/">many of the essential building blocks I track on when it comes to API evangelism</a>. I get regular requests from companies who are looking for evangelism and advocacy resources -- in desperate need of smart folks who can help craft content, crank out code, in the service of evangelizing a platform.</p>
<p>The work I'm doing with Cloud Elements, is the early work to help deliver on what API providers, and service providers are needing. Right now we are on-boarding new folks to the concept, and getting feedback on what some of the common elements, and challenges will be. One of the folks I'm engaging with on this is expert PHP and API developer, tech lead, author, consultant and open source maintainer, Lorna Mitchell (<a href="https://twitter.com/lornajane">@lornajane</a>).</p>
<p>Lorna is one of several folks I've been working with to help deliver on API Evangelist projects ranging from blog, and white papers, to training, and how-to guides. If you are a PHP developer, <a href="http://www.lornajane.net/?s=git&amp;submit=Search">have been learning about Git and Github in the last couple of years you have probably come across Lorna's work</a>. I was talking to my friend Mark Body on Skype today, and mentioned Lorna and he said oh yeah, I've used her Git training materials before, in my stories and talks -- something I echoed as well, having pointed my readers and clients to her training materials regularly.</p>
<p>After five years of doing what I call hacker storytelling, writing code, JSON, and stories about APIs, I understand how much hard work goes into creating content that is educational and simple, focused on very technical topics like APIs, while also driving search engine traffic over long periods of time. Lorna has done very well these areas,crafting blog posts that will keep being surfaced in Google searches for a long time to come, and help walk people through some very lofty technical concepts--wave after wave.</p>
<p>If you are needing help with storytelling as part of your industry, or API platform, let me know. I'm happy to see where I can help. Feel free to reach out to Lorna as well, she is looking to help the right companies and platforms craft white papers, guides, training and tutorials. If you are an evangelist who is looking to do the same, let me know, and I'm also happy to plug you into the community we are assembling, and see where you can help deliver. If you want to test drive some of first tasks and challenges we have going on in the beta phase, you are welcome to sign up on your own at&nbsp;<a href="https://cloudelements.influitive.com/join/dev032016">Mt. EveREST</a>-- things are just getting going, and we could use your feedback.</p>

        <span class="post-date">26 Apr 2016</span>
        <p><a href="https://api.slack.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/slack-platform-keeping-in-touch.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>One of the side effects of the recent bot craze, is that I'm getting to showcase the often very healthy API practices of Slack, as they grow, scale, and manage their developer ecosystem. Slack is beginning to renew my faith that there are API providers out there who give a shit, and aren't just looking to exploit their ecosystems. There are two Slack blog posts that have triggered these thoughts, <a href="https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/the-slack-platform-roadmap-34067b054177#.mhuax8lrn">one on the Slack platform road map</a>, and <a href="https://slackhq.com/a-little-thing-about-release-notes-997d2e06842d#.hmmeyia86">a little thing about release notes</a>, both of which reflect what I would love to see other API providers emulate in their platform operations.</p>
<p>Slack is going the extra mile to set the right tone in their community, with what I consider to be some of the essential communication building blocks of API operations, but they simply call <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"keep in touch"</strong></span>:</p>

<ul>
</ul>
<p>I just copied and pasted that from their developer portal. Slack does not stop there, also providing an&nbsp;<a title="Frequently asked questions" href="https://api.slack.com/faq">FAQ</a>, a&nbsp;<a href="https://api.slack.com/docs/community-code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://trello.com/b/HPpcIqd8/slack-app-ideaboard" target="_blank">Ideaboard</a>&nbsp;to further set the tone for how things can and should work in a community. What I like about the tone Slack is taking, is that it is balanced--"keep in touch"! Which really is just as much about us API consumers, as it is about Slack. Slack has done the hard work of providing most of the essential API building blocks, as well as a valuable API resource, now its up to the community to deliver--this balance is important, and we should be staying in touch.</p>
<p>Remember the tone Twitter took with us? Developer Rules of the Road!! Very different tone than "keep in touch". The tone really matters, as well as the investment in the common building blocks that enable "keeping in touch", both synchronous, and asynchronously. Having a road map, and change log for your API goes a long way, but telling the behind the why, how, and vision behind your road map and change log--gives me hope that this API thing might actually work.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite popular belief in Silicon Valley, there are many different ways to fund the design, development, deployment, and operation of valuable API resources. Not all APIs are destined to be the next Amazon, Twitter, or even Twilio. Some APIs just need exist, be available, and will never be a revenue engine--one of these APIs is the <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/api/bulk-info/#judge-data">Court Listener API.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/">Version 3.0 of the Court Listener API possesses 15 valuable endpoints</a>, providing access to&nbsp;courts, dockets, opinions, people, sources, ratings, and other details about how laws are made in the United States. <a href="https://free.law/2016/04/19/judicial-database-announcement/">With their latest release containing a comprehensive database of judges and the judiciary, to be linked to Court Listener&rsquo;s corpus of legal opinions authored by those judges</a>.</p>
<p>Increasingly APIs like Court Listener, and the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/31/gathering-my-thoughts-about-open-referral-and-the-human-services-api/">Human Services Data Specification (HSDS) API</a>, are capturing my attention. These types of APIs represent the type of impact I'm looking to make using APIs, going beyond what APIs can do for a single application or industry, but what they can do for wider sections of our society. Focusing on getting agile, nimble, and more efficient in how craft laws in our country, and how we make sure people are fed, and find the government services they need in their life.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/donate/">The Court Listener API depends on grants, and donations to operate</a>, which is an approach I will be showcasing more when it applies to APIs that deliver valuable human, civic, and research related resources. APIs like the Court Listener API provide an important window into how our local, state, and federal judicial system is operating (or not), and will need our financial support to do what they do. Which I think is a very viable approach to designing, deploying, and operating APis -- that is, if we all step up and support these efforts.</p>

<p>I am using my <a href="http://minimum.viable.api.operations.definition.apievangelist.com/">minimum viable API operations definition tool</a> to continue profiling the API sector, this time to size up the Slack API community. Slack is kind of a darling of the API space, so it kind of seem silly to profile them, but profiling those who are doing this API think right, is what API Evangelist all about--whether I follow the hype or not.</p>
<p>Using my minimum viable API definition, I went through the Slack API portal looking for what I'd consider to be the essential building blocks that any modern API platform should have.</p>

<p>Performing better than <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/04/21/sizing-up-the-imaterialise-3d-printing-api-with-my-minimum-viable-api-operations-definition/">the review of the i.Materialise 3D printing API</a> that I conducted the other day, Slack checks off all but one of the essential building blocks-everything except for pricing. The only other area(s) that I find deficient, is when it comes to machine readable API definitions like OpenAPI Spec and Postman Collections. These aren't required for success, but they can sure go a long ways in helping developers on-board from documentation, to generating code, and tooling that will be needed for integration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm assuming Slack hasn't generated OpenAPI Specs because they have a more XML-RPC design, which I think many folks assume can't be documented in this way. While it doesn't lend itself to more easily being documented with OpenAPI Spec, I found some simple little hacks that make it doable, allowing you to also document even XML-RPC designs. Having some OpenAPI Specs and Postman Collections would make the API more accessible for people looking to play with.</p>
<p>Anyways, I just wanted to test out the <a href="http://minimum.viable.api.operations.definition.apievangelist.com/">minimum viable API operations tool</a> on another API. I am trying to profile several APIs in this way each week, helping the number of APIs I am monitoring grow, while also encouraging other API providers to follow Slack's lead.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://apievangelist.com/2016/04/25/openapi-specifications-for-642-of-the-schemaorg-types/">OpenAPI Specifications For 642 Of The Schema.org Types</a></h3>
        <span class="post-date">25 Apr 2016</span>
        <p><a href="https://schema.org"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/schema-org/schema-org.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I am gearing up for another wave of <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">API definition</a> work, so I am taking the opportunity to produce some more tooling that assists me in the process. One of the tools I want to build, is a simple solution for walking me through one or many OpenAPI Specs, and push me to make sure every parameter has a complete set of descriptions. I possess amazing powers of bullshit, and can craft default description for almost anything I come across, but it would be nice to have an an ever evolving autocomplete dictionary to augment my existing super powers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I already have <a href="http://apis.json.autocomplete.apievangelist.com/">an APIs.json driven autocomplete tool, that loops through all the parameters within the OpenAPI Specs that are indexed</a>. I just needed a rich set of fields and parameters to pull from -- <a href="https://schema.org">Schema.org</a>. The rich vocabulary that is Schema.org possesses 992 properties across 642 schema types. I've long wanted to craft OpenAPI Specs for Schema.org, but needed a reason to help push things forward, and this is a perfect opportunity to kick things off.</p>
<p><a href="http://schema.org.apis.apievangelist.com/">As a starting point, I created 642 separate OpenAPI Specs</a>. One for each of the schema types. I already have an API that will generate an OpenAPI Spec from any JSON schema, building out GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods, as well as a default 200 response, and connecting it to the schema for the API response definition. As I was doing the work I realized that I didn't want to limit the OpenAPI Specs to just the JSON version, so as I generated I also published a YAML version.</p>
<p><a href="http://schema.org.apis.apievangelist.com/"><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/schema-org-api-definitions.png" alt="" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>Next I'm going to use <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist-tools/schema-org-openapi-specs/tree/gh-pages/api-commons">these 642 OpenAPI Specs as an autocomplete index</a> for helping me quickly fluff up the parameters of other existing API definitions. Next I'll work on wiring up the hierarchies and relationships present in the Schema.org definitions. Right now, none of the OpenAPI Specs will validate as the parameter types aren't all valid, but I didn't want to lose the object references.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond being an autocomplete index which I can use across my micro tools for working with API definitions, I am thinking this Schema.org work will bear a shit ton of fruit in future work. I would like to have API implementations for many of the more common Schema.org types, allowing me to help folks design, and deploy Schema.org compliant APIs. Something that I feel will go a long way to help stabilize and standardize APIs, by helping them speak using a more common vocabulary.</p>

        <span class="post-date">23 Apr 2016</span>
        <p><a href="http://apis.json.annotation.apievangelist.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/apis-json-annotation.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>I am working on <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/04/09/playing-with-one-possible-openapi-spec-for-the-human-services-data-specification-hsds/">one possible API definition for the Human Services Definition Specification (HSDS)</a>, and the next phase of this work involves bringing in a small group of technical, and non-technical folks to have discussions around their API designs, in context of the master specification I am looking to pull together.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help drive the discussion I am wanted to use the <a href="http://adopta-agency.github.io/open-referral-api/api-commons/openapi-spec.json">OpenAPI Specification that I created for HSDS</a>, and I also knew I wanted to use Github issue management to help keep track of the synchronous, and asynchronous conversation that would occur around it. However Github tends to have a perceived barrier to entry for many non-developers (which I don't fully get), so I wanted to leverage the platform, but also soften the way everyone discussed the overall specification, as well as each individual endpoint.</p>
<p>The HSDS specification is pretty verbose, and I needed a way to have conversations at the high level, but also down to the endpoint level. To help facilitate this, I got to work on a<a href="http://apis.json.annotation.apievangelist.com/"> prototype micro tool which enables a conversation around any API(s) that are indexed within an APIs.json file</a>, producing a human readable list of endpoints, parameters, etc., but then uses Github issue management as the core of the conversation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Resulting in <a href="http://apis.json.annotation.apievangelist.com/">my APIs.json Annotation tool</a>. It is just a first draft, so there will be a lot of changes that need to occur. I'm going to test it against 20+ APIs.json collections I have defined as part of <a href="http://theapistack.com">my API Stack</a> work to try and harden it a little bit. My APIs.json Annotation tool runs in my single repo app style, leveraging Jekyll + Github Pages + Github API to operate--Github is the front and backend.</p>
<p>Anyone can view the conversation, but if you want to participate you have to be added to the Github repository, and pass in a <a href="https://github.com/settings/tokens">Github personal token</a>. This is something I often automate with a simple Github login, where I use <a href="http://OAuth.io">OAuth.io to obtain token</a>, but I kind of see the token as a minimum viable investment to understanding Github for using each tool.</p>
<p>It is really important to me that each app stands on its own feet. Not all of my micro tools that I develop in this way will enjoy zero outside dependencies, but most of them can be easily forked, and ran in any Github user account or org (with little or no setup). Conversations around API is just one area I am looking to simulate with this approach to delivering tooling, and specifically APIs.json tooling, that can be used throughout an API life cycle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are welcome to play with <a href="http://apis.json.annotation.apievangelist.com/">the APIs.json Annotation</a>, or any <a href="http://apievangelist.com">of the other tools I have listed on my home page</a>. I will keep adding them here, so that they can be found, but like all my work they are all a work in progress. <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist-tools">Each tool has its own dedicated repo and issue management</a>, where you are welcome to join in the conversation around the road map for each one. I am just looking to develop a robust toolbox of small micro tools that will help be more successful across the life cycle of the APIs I am working on, but maybe you can benefit using them too.</p>

<p>I tend to only work in environments where I have full control over the server, so Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is never really an issue for any of the APIs I have control over, but is a pervasive problem for APIs, and JSON files I come across on the web. This is one of the reasons I really enjoy the fact that I publish all of my JSON driven, hacker storytelling projects using Github Pages and Jekyll.</p>
<p>In the last couple weeks I have been working on a bunch of micro tools that deliver specific functionality which can then be used throughout the API life cycle. All of these apps are developed using JavaScript, and depend on being able to read from any number of JSON file stores. Sometimes these files are stored within the project, but most likely I'm calling the remote JSON files of other projects, something that depends on the sharing of resources across domains.</p>
<p>If I am publishing a JSON file publicly on the open Internet, I want it to be accessible from anywhere. CORS has to be default. The speed, and agility at which I'm able to ingest and work with APIs.json files, and the OpenAPI Spec indexes they contain, sets me up for some serious nimbleness across my work.</p>
<p>If you are working with open data on the web, make sure and consider the CORS enablement by default when working with your JSON data on Github. It will make your life easier, as well as anyone else who will be looking to consume the valuable data you are putting out there.</p>

<p>I'm always on the hunt for like-minded folks who I can partner with, and bring needed products, services, and tools to the API space. If someone is selling something to the API space, its likely I have had a conversation with them about the sector at some point. I always enjoy these regular encounters, but its the handful of them that continue, and evolve into deeper relationships that I enjoy the most.</p>
<p>One of most recent relationship which I have been cultivating, is with a new <a href="https://www.hitchhq.com/">API startup called Hitch</a>. I have a long history with both the founders Bruno Pedro (<a href="https://twitter.com/bpedro">@bpedro</a>) and Luke Miller (<a href="https://twitter.com/lukeam">@lukeam</a>), in their previous lives with API Changelog and <a href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a>, but began talking with them more heavily bout their vision for Hitch earlier this year. I have spent considerable time with Luke and Bruno discussing the current state of the API life cycle, from design to deprecation, helping contribute to their vision and road map in any way that I can.</p>
<p>As Hitch prepares to shift into higher gear, helping API providers build community, the Hitch team asked me to join the team in an advisory capacity. I am always happy to share my thoughts, experience, and views on the space, but I'm stoked for the opportunity to help advise them on their road map. As Hitch evolves, you'll hear me tell more stories about the solutions they are bringing to the API life cycle. I'm hoping I can influence what they bring to the API life cycle, while also using them as another valuable source of stories about the API space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hitch is just getting going so there isn't much for me to focus on yet, but I'm looking forward to continue sharing my research with the team, to help them in any way I can. I just wanted to put it out there that I was involved, and turn up the volume my public storytelling about building community, and the API life cycle in preparation for what Hitch is bringing to table. I'm looking forward to being part of what is cooking over at Hitch--stay tuned!</p>

<p>I was just participating in an interesting conference call about multiple API implementations, which are putting the <a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/OpenReferral/blob/master/Human%20Services%20Data%20Specification%20%20v1.0.md">Human Services Definition Specification (HSDS)</a> to use. The call was brought together discuss a shift in the current path one of the projects was taking, which involved using <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/search/">Azure Search Service</a>, and whether or not the original vendor solution was still necessary, because the cloud solution appeared to meet all their needs.</p>
<p>I sat and listened to the pros and cons of each approach. Why Azure allowed them to quickly meet the project needs, and could scale. Why the other vendor solution had a more holistic view of the problem, and shared the investment from many implementations. I had nothing to offer. The only common ground I had was around the already established schema for delivering human services. I didn't have any awareness of each individual project, the resources and skills available each group possessed, or a belief in any particular cloud platform, database solution, or programming language.</p>
<p>While Azure, and the other vendor approach dominated the first part of the conversation, everyone one on the call was in agreement around HSDS driving everyone's schema, while also agreeing were missing a common approach to defining and delivering the API. The vendor on the call was working on the next version of their API which used the HSDS format, with the Azure driven solution spoke HSDS as well. To add to the mix, I am also working on two additional implementations that will also be speaking HSDS--we all just needed a common approach to defining the API.</p>
<p>As the next step, I suggested scheduling another call, where I walk through <a href="http://developer.open.referral.adopta.agency/">the API definition I am applying to my projects</a>, providing a YAML version of my OpenAPI Spec definition. I prefer using YAML, to help lower the cognitive barrier to entry for business users of the group, demonstrating how OpenAPI Spec can be used by everyone to quantify each individual API, but in a way that we can share, discuss, and reuse--helping establish a harmony in design across all of our implementations.</p>
<p>I always work hard to not set the bar to high when it comes to the magical powers of <a href="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/">API definitions</a> have when it comes to facilitating API discussions between technical and business groups, but the benefits in situations like this are clear. I feel API definitions have the potential to help folks unpack the dogma (and insecurities) we all possess around the architectural decisions we have made, the programming languages we are using, and the cloud platforms that are increasingly depending on. Continuing to demonstrate for me the ways that APIs can help facilitate how we work together, with API definitions acting as a machine readable specification that can help us define what is needed by everyone at the table.</p>

        <span class="post-date">22 Apr 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 5px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-personal-api-decisions.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" /></p>
<p><a href="http://bionicteaching.com/a-bit-more-on-the-personal-api/">My friend Tom Woodward is continuing his personal API journey on his blog</a>, sharing more of his thoughts around taking control over his information, and sharing some of the conversational exhaust that his journey has generated. The conversation around what what is "personal API", is where the value in all of this for me, something that is full of endless perspectives, and views of what APIs do. Which is one of the things I truly love about APIs, as they mean so many different things to different folks.</p>
<p>As i mentioned before, <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/16/personal-api-are-not-just-a-local-destination-they-are-a-journey/">when I mention the concept of personal API to some of my engineering friends</a>, they seem to always focus on people designing, developing, and operating an API stack on their own server, or at home. The recent post from Tom, focuses around a comment from our other friend Alan, who commented on his previous post, talking about the process of personal API being, "a bit binary (reclaim or &ldquo;let it burn&rdquo;)". I'm thinking Alan's perspective has been strongly influenced by Tom's heavy "reclaim" desires, as well as two other friends, who have embarked on similar journeys.</p>
<p>I'm endlessly intrigued by the dimensions of personal API that people are drawn into, and focus on. That personal API is about hosting or managing your API, or just about getting your information out of someones platform. When I read Tom's post, I actually do not see local or cloud, reclaim or let it burn, I see Tom working to understanding what information he generates online, understand the tradeoff's around the platform where this information lives, then logically making decisions around how he manage this. Sure this might involve abandoning platforms, and could involve setting up some self-hosted APIs, but more often it will not.</p>
<p>I can't help but think Alan might be missing some details of his own personal API journey, as a result of his focus on his friends. When we focus to heavily on a specific aspect of API enablement (migration), I find people tend to miss many of the other benefits also occurring. I'm guessing that many the reasons that went into his original adoption of Flickr, feeling like he can rely on it, and his lack of interest in ever leaving the platform, were most likely API influenced. APIs have have made Flickr a a ubiquitous tool in our lives, allowing the community to share photos using <a href="http://oembed.com/">oEmbed</a>, develop valuable syndication, upload, and other useful solution, including WordPress integrations, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.flickr.com/tools/aperture">tools like Aperture</a>--APIs have been shaping everyone's decision to use the photo sharing platform for many years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the reasons I keep using the phrase personal API, is because of how people respond to it, view it, and accept of reject it. To me, personal API involves having my own hosted API stack, depending on 3rd party APIs (my personal storage API is Amazon S3 &amp; Dropbox), to host, sync, share, syndicate, publish, reclaim, orchestrate, collaborate, control, open, and restrict access to my bits and bytes. My journey is not yours, and your journey is not mine, but the process of sharing our stories, and having conversations around it are critical to each of us learning from each other.</p>
<p>APIs are empowering every brand you know and love (or hate) to make decisions around how they maximize where their bits and bytes are stored, accessed, and put to use across the web, mobile, and increasingly devices. Additionally APIs are empowering every brand you know and love (or hate) to also make better decisions around how they maximize where your bits and bytes are stored, accessed, and put to use across the web, mobile, and increasingly devices. Personal APIs are about shifting this balance in your favor, but for many of us, in many situations, we are fine with offloading these decisions to others, as it can be lot of work to operate on our own. &nbsp;At some point though, when they are ready, there will be a wealth of information out there to help them take back control, no matter how small that first step it might be.</p>
<p>In the end, I don't care if anyone cares about APIs, or personal APIs, but I do care about people being aware of the online services they use, and that they are equipped to make the best possible decisions they can about what services they use. For me it is less about APIs, than it is about how APIs are already being used to enable your world, and helping ensure that you have the awareness and opportunity to assert whatever amount of control over your digital self that you feel comfortable doing, whenever you are ready.</p>

<p>I always have an inbox full of requests from companies asking me to take a look at their APIs, and provide any feedback that I can. I do conduct a more formal review for some companies, but I also enjoy looking through the API operations of any API, just as part of my regular monitoring (if I have time). When I do have time, the first part of any scope of review, is to see if it meets my definition of a minimum viable API operation.</p>
<p>This is a definition I've been refining for over five years now, looking through thousands of APIs. Even with all this refinement, I still need a single place I could go, and quickly apply to any of the APIs that are in my review queue. My objective in doing these reviews is partly to help me get to know what an API does, but also provide feedback to the API providers, as well as generate stories that I can share with my readers, helping them polish their own strategy along the way.</p>
<p>To help me streamline the reviews I do, and deliver feedback to API providers, I created a little micro tool for my self, that I can use as a checklist while I go through the operations of each API in my queue. To beta test my <a href="http://minimum.viable.api.operations.definition.apievangelist.com/">minimum viable API operation definition tool</a>,&nbsp;I profiled the <a href="https://i.materialise.com/api/">3D printing API i.Materialise</a>.</p>

<p>The only areas the i.Materialise API stumbles for me is having a road map, change log, as well as a dedicated support page, with a contact person and email to reach out to. You can go to the public side of the i.Materialise site and use the contact page, which is linked in the footer of the developer portal, but I strongly recommend having a dedicated support page, and channels that are dedicated to the API community.</p>
<p>The blog, RSS, and Twitter feeds are not dedicated to the API, and are company-wide. This is fine, but at some point I recommend a dedicated blog, RSS, and Twitter accounts for the API. It can be easy to burn out API consumers with too much general information that doesn't apply to them, and there is little overhead involved with deploying a blog, RSS, and Twitter accounts dedicated to the community.</p>
<p>iMaterialise is closer to being a complete API definition, than most APIs that I look at--something that won't take much effort to bring up to speed. The area I do recommend they focus energy on is around the availability of an <a href="http://apis.how/xmynjnqxwr">OpenAPI Spec</a>, <a href="https://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>, and <a href="http://apis.how/xakqrgkfkm">Postman Collections</a> for the platform. These elements would significantly add to the available documentation for the platform, while also allowing them to <a href="https://apimatic.io/">easily generate SDKs for the platform using APIMATIC</a>, which is another deficient area for the API (no code page). In addition to better docs and SDKs, these API definitions would allow any developers to quick load up, and begin playing with the API in popular HTTP clients like <a href="http://apis.how/gwbjyujag1">Postman</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://apis.how/ebsh6b2hrd">DHC</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lack of an OpenAPI Spec is the most deficient area in my opinion. The availability of a definition, would push the presence of the iMaterialise 3D Printing API beyond the minimum viable API operation definition for me, and into the zone of a robust platform. One that will go along way towards attracting new developers, on boarding them quicker, and helping them go from discovery to successful integration -- which is what this is all about.</p>
<p>Next, if I have the time, I will create an OpenAPI Spec for the platform which will give me more awareness around the actual API design.</p>

        <span class="post-date">21 Apr 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-outside-in.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" /></p>
<p>A &nbsp;huge pet peeve for me is when a company has a blog, but not provide an RSS feed--it really grinds my gears! Although it is something that aggravates me, I understand many of the reasons behind it. People just don't see their blog through an outside lens. They visit other company blogs when they want to read them, usually via a bookmark, or possibly rely on an email digest once a week--they aren't RSS reader users. RSS consumers were always a niche (that almost went mainstream), but is one that has taken a big hit with the closing of Google Reader.</p>
<p>I'm sure most of the companies would immediately turn on an RSS feed if I dropped them an email, but I'd rather write about it, and reach just the cream (my readers) on top of the API space. One of the most important side effects of being on the API journey in my opinion, is that expansion, evolution, and fine tuning of your powers for empathy that will occur along the way. Your API developer portal becomes a front line for conversations with the outside world, where you will carefully(hopefully) share your most precious internal resources, and entertain external views on how they should be exposed and put to use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my experience companies who are able to think outside the corporate firewall, do the best with APIs, with those who are open to culture change in close second--everyone else will falter. I can't help but feel that RSS is a very 101 example of this in action. I want you to read my blog, but because I didn't think beyond what I do, and my peers, when it comes to providing and consuming blogs, having an RSS feed didn't occur to me. If I was an RSS reader user, and the absence of RSS was a pain point, my tune would be different.</p>
<p>You can see this awareness in play over at <a href="https://www.workiva.com/">the&nbsp;risk, audit, finance, and compliance platform Workiva</a>. It is one of the few places I've seen <a href="http://investor.workiva.com/investors/resources/default.aspx">RSS at work in such a useful, and transparent way</a>:</p>
<p><img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/blog/workiva-rss.png" alt="" width="250" /></p>
<p>This is a level of RSS, and corporate accessibility that I only dream of. If I had an RSS feed for the press releases, event schedule, and SEC filings for every company I track on, I'd be in heaven. However with Workiva, the dream ends there--<a href="https://www.workiva.com/blog">their blog doesn't have an RSS feed</a>, or at least one that I can easily find.&nbsp;Which for me demonstrates where the average company invests in, and will develop empathy. It is usually developed around their own pain points in their operation, and within their own industry. Workiva is in the the business of monitoring corporations, and they see the value in having RSS for the signals that matter the most to them--blog, obviously not that important of a signal in this game yet.</p>
<p>I do not expect every company to cater to every need the long tail of what the public will want, nor do I expect all companies to be able to see their company through an external lens right out of the gate, but for me, the existence of RSS is one signal I tune into--similar to the signals having an API, or not having an API sends. I understand that many of my readers see RSS as a pretty insignificant thing, but for me having a blog, but not considering the wider syndication, distribution, and consumption of said blog, contributes to how I view a company's ability to think outside their firewall, and empathize with their customers, the public, and external players like me.</p>

        <span class="post-date">19 Apr 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 10p;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-people.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></p>
<p>I've heard the same thing for years--that the average person will never care about their digital stuff enough to ever want to learn about APIs, let alone for the concept of the personal API to ever be a thing. People love to comment, and tweet it at me anytime I talk about evangelizing APIs to normals, about reclaiming your domain, or <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2016/03/16/personal-api-are-not-just-a-local-destination-they-are-a-journey/">the concept of the personal API</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First off, you aren't original. IT has been telling the normals to not worry their :pretty little head" about the technical details for many, many years. It is how those with the power stay in power. If people are technically literate, and we built simple technology solutions for people, they wouldn't need us, or buy our bullshit. It is a very scary notion for many of us very insecure technologists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've worked as a professional developer since 1987, IT lead since 1998, and been evangelizing the API opportunity since 2004. These arguments are nothing new for me, but it does fascinate me that people think they are original, with very little awareness of the larger machine they operate on behalf of when they wield these statements. Like I should stop doing what I do, and having the expectations that I have, because the entire world will not fall into line -- its all or nothing. ?? WTF</p>
<p>I do not think in scale like you do. You are the slave in believing that all your ideas should scale. Not me. I'm happy if I reach one person. People like Tom Woodward (<a href="https://twitter.com/twoodwar">@twoodwar</a>), who understand that personal APIs are not about a single, perfect stack of APIs, living on a single beautiful server in your living room. Which is another rookie assault I get from fantasy believing developers looking to disarm my notion of the personal API, with their extremely simple view of what it is a "personal API".</p>
<p><a href="http://bionicteaching.com/personal-api-progress-in-pursuit-of-nirvana/">Tom is well on his way, when it comes to the API journey</a>. Tom understands that he doesn't have to be a rockstar ninja developer, or all mighty IT player to use APIs. Tom is just working to understand the footprint he leaves online each day, where all hist bits and bytes live, and how he can assert more control over this digital version of his existence. Tom will mostly likely never have a perfect stack of APIs (as technologists envision), but he is making some impressive inroads when it comes to identifying where he operates online, where he'd prefer to be operating, and how APIs can help him achieve the level of understanding and control he is seeking.</p>
<p>My mission as the API Evangelist is not about convincing everyone that APIs are a thing, and that everyone should care about APIs being available on all the platforms that we use as part of personal and professional lives. My mission is about convincing individuals, and individual business owners that they should always be asking the questions that Tom is asking, and working towards a better understanding of their digital self. Each person, business, organization, institution, or government agency I can influence to embark on their API journey, is a win for me.</p>
<p>So remember, when you tell me how nobody will every care about their digital stuff enough to want to learn about APIs, or embark on their own personal API journey, you just marked yourself as being a cog in a very old machine. You believe you are smarter than the average person, and that people are incapable of managing their own digital self, and should pay you, and the new class of technologists to do it for them. I probably shouldn't be educating y'all about this, and just let you keep self identifying for me where you stand on what role technology plays in our lives.</p>

        <span class="post-date">19 Apr 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-ownership.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was reading a post about how <a href="http://www.itbusinessedge.com/blogs/data-security/unclear-sense-of-ownership-hurts-api-security.html">having an&nbsp;unclear sense of ownership hurts API security</a>, which showcases the different views on who owns security, when it comes to exposing corporate digital assets via APIs. When I read the title, I anticipated the story being about a difference in how ownership of the asset(s) itself is viewed, but it ended up focusing on the ownership of security itself, not ownership of the assets which are being exposed -- something I think gets closer to the root of the problem, than who "owns security".&nbsp;</p>
<p>In short, the IT and developers who are often charged with exposing corporate assets via APIs will view those digital resource in some very different ways, than other people at the company. These groups will focus on exposing digital resources in a very technical sense, making them available so that others can integrate into their apps and systems--it isn't always in their nature to secure things sensibly. Their focus is to open up access, something the article touches on, but is something I think it goes deeper than just being about API security. Developers and IT are rarely ever going to see the digital resource in the same way that business stakeholders will, let alone security focused players (hopefully your IT and dev team has specialist influencing things).</p>
<p>APIs have made a name for themselves because a handful of companies successfully exposed their digital resources in this new way, allowing external perspectives of those digital resources to enter the conversation, which allowed for innovation to occur. In this handful of API origin stories we tell like to tell, owners of the digital resources at play were open to outside views of what their digital resource was, and how that resource could be put to use. These leading companies were open to an alternative view of the ownership and access of these digital resources, something that allowed API platforms to flourish &lt;&lt; This <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is not</span> something that will happen in all situations.</p>
<p>APIs really begin to go wrong, when the sense of ownership around digital resource is already unhealthy, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2016/03/21/almost-everyone-is-doing-the-api-economy-wrong/">resulting in what my friend Ed Anuff speaks of, with everyone doing the API economy wrong</a>. Without proper buy-in, developers and IT will often overlook security around resources being exposed--they just don't understand the importance of the resource in the same way. Coming from the opposite direction, business users will often come in and apply their "wet blanket" sense of ownership on the platform--resulting in heavy handed registration and approval flows, sales cycle(s), pricing, rate limits, and other common things you see slow API adoption.</p>
<p>APIs should be about us exposing our digital resources using the now ubiquitous Internet technology, in a way that opens up our resources, and the culture our business, organizations, institutions, and government agencies to outside views about what our resources are, and how they can be put to use. This is something that when done in the right environment, can reap some serious benefits for everyone involved, but when done in a culture where there is a already an imbalance around what digital resource ownership is, shit can really go wrong -- with security being just one stage where it plays out. In the end, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">APIs are not for everyone</span>. Some people just have too strict of a view around the value of their digital resources, and of the ownership of that resource, for the API thing to every actually work--with company IT and developer security practices being just a symptom of a much larger illness.</p>

<p>I track on the API operations of around 2000 companies. Honestly, most of the 10K+ APIs in the ProgrammableWeb API directory have long been gone, deprecated, acquired, and had the lights shut off. There are only a couple thousand companies, institutions, organizations, and government who are doing public APIs, with only a couple hundred doing them in an interesting way.</p>
<p>This should not diminish the API conversation, as public APIs are just one aspect of the API discussion, and honestly it is one are that not all companies and organizations will have the stomach for. However, a certain amount of available public APIs will always play an important role in setting the tone for the entire API space, providing us with a (hopefully a diverse amount of) lead(s) when it comes to crafting our own strategies for operating our businesses on the Internet. Very little of what I do as the API Evangelist involves ideas that originate from my own head, and is something that requires a wealth of examples which I can point to in the wild.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am working on new ways to earn a living, while also generating research, analysis, code, and specification that the API sector can put to use in their own operations. One way I will be doing this, is by publishing technology, businesses, and politics of API design guides. This isn't API design as in the sense of REST, and how you craft endpoints, it is design thinking around the operations of your API. I learn a ton, flipping through the API portals of the 2000+ companies I keep an eye on, and I wanted to carve off small chunks of this, and share with you.</p>
<p>One area of API operations that has always fascinated me, and is one of the original founding focuses of API Evangelist, is how companies craft their API plans and pricing. Whether or not an API has a plans &amp; pricing page is a very telling signal all by itself, as APIs are often a side-project, without any real support and investment from its parent company or organization, and the lack of a coherent plan, with simple pricing is often a sign of other deficiencies. However when an API plan and pricing page is present, I to find it to be a very telling representation of a company, organization, institution, government agencies, and even individual(s) in some cases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I track on many data points for any single API I keep an eye on. Ranging from their Twitter account, and Blog RSS, to the activity of their Github profiles. One of the areas I link to, when present, is the plans and pricing pages. This gives me the ability to quickly check up on the pricing of APIs across various business sectors, something that drives my <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">API plans research</a>. With the help of my <a href="http://developer.kinlane.com/">organization API</a>, and my <a href="http://developer.kinlane.com/">screenshot API</a>, I was able to easily harvest, organize, and make available the plans and pricing for 250 of what I feel are some of the more relevant APIs out there today.</p>
<p>To help make my research more explorable, I organized my API plan and pricing highlights into a single PDF guide, which allows you to experience the best of my API research, without all the clicking and searching I had to do. When I record details about the plans and pricing for an API, I have a rating of 1-3 for what I call API plan coupling, which is how tightly coupled their monetization strategy is to their API. Is the pricing that is present directly applied to API consumption, or is it more for the SaaS or PaaS side of things? While not all of the plans &amp; pricing I include in this research are tightly coupled with the API, they are all from platforms where the API does play a significant role in platform operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have many of these the common building blocks employed for the <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/">API monetization strategy</a>, and for the actual <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">API plan implementations</a>, recorded in a machine readable way, as part of my research. For this guide, I wanted to step back, and look at things through more of a design lens, and less from the technical, business, or even the political side of things. I think the visual of each plan and pricing page says a lot, and doesn't need a bunch of analysis from me to fluff it up. Just flipping through, you get a sense of what looks good, what doesn't, a process that I think will hopefully push forward more consistency across the API space.</p>
<p>There are numerous lessons present in the screenshots in this guide, around which building blocks are required to support API plans and pricing. Things like breaking things up into tiers, providing contact information, mechanisms for receiving a quote, demo, and know that a trial version is available. There are also lessons in how to present large amounts of very complex information, and some lessons in not how to do it, with plenty of evidence of why simple works. Oh, and that you should have a decent graphic designer! ;-)</p>
<p>I dismiss claims from the vocal startup, and VC elite, who point out the absolutes when it comes to API monetization, and pricing. That freemium won't work, and that offering unlimited access via API is always a mistake. Every company, API, and consumer will be different. In my opinion there are a wealth of strategies available out there to learn from, which we can apply in your own strategy. There are many variables, seen and unseen, that go into whether or not an API will be "successful" or not, and I strongly reject the notion there are absolutes -- there are only agendas, usually of the behind the scenes kind.</p>
<p>I have a number of API plans and pricing pages that I did not include in the current release of this guide. I will consider evolving, and shifting it up regularly, like I try to do with my other guides. I know I learn a lot from having them in a single place, that I can easily flip through and experience the design patterns present across these 250 API platforms, and hopefully you do to. I'm currently planning an interactive micro-app version of this research, as well as the coffee table edition for the API socialite who also enjoys entertaining.</p>

        <span class="post-date">15 Apr 2016</span>
        <p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-developer-catalog.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" /></p>
<p>I was going through <a href="http://developer.ean.com">the Expedia Affiliate Network</a> again yesterday, as part of my <a href="http://travel.stack.network/">Travel Stack Network</a> work. Having individual research projects that pop up on my radar, and force to me take a fresh look at API providers is a huge part of what I do. As I was going through their portal, taking a fresh look at things, their <a href="http://developer.ean.com/approved-devs/catalog/">approved developer catalog</a>&nbsp;was something that stood out for me.</p>
<p>A list of approved developers for any API is something I get asked about fairly regularly, so I want to keep referencing examples when I come across in the wild. Each developer entry in the catalog has the following details:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Logo - </strong>A company logo, or photo of individual developer.</li>
<li><strong>Name -</strong> Name of the company or devloper.</li>
<li><strong>Title -</strong> The title of the developer that is available.</li>
<li><strong>Website -</strong> A dedicated website for the developer.</li>
<li><strong>Address - </strong>The physical or mailing address.</li>
<li><strong>Email -</strong> An individual or company email address.</li>
<li><strong>Office Phone - </strong>The office / business line for developer.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile Phone -</strong> A mobile phone for developer.</li>
<li><strong>Company Description - </strong>Details about the company.</li>
<li><strong>Developer Overview </strong>- Any additional details about developers.</li>
<li><strong>Sample(s) Of Work - </strong>Samples of work with title, description, and a link.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the big picture, I would bundle developer programs, and catalogs as just another layer of a partner program for any platform. Developer would just be an additional tier, sharing most of the same characteristics of other partner programs. I'll have to figure out how to clearly articulate the developer portion, and coherently weave into <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">my existing partner research</a>.</p>
<p>I'd like to see mature partner and developer programs operating within every API out there. I'm hoping we'll see this dimension of regular operations gain traction, alongside some of the tightening down of API programs I am seeing, and API providers work to get to know their ecosystems better. In my opinion, it will all work together to help ensure individual API community health, as well as the health of the wider API space.</p>
