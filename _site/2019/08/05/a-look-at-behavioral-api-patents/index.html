I have been studying uses of behavioral technology lately. Riffing off my partner in crimes work on the subject, but putting my own spin on it, and adding APIs (of course) into the mix. Applying on of my classic techniques, I figured I’d start with a patent search for “behavioral application programming interfaces”. I find patents to be a “wonderful” source of inspiration and understanding when it comes to what is going on with technology. Here are the top results for my patent search, with title, abstract, and a link to understand more about each patent.

<p><a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PTXT&amp;p=1&amp;S1=(((behavioral+AND+application)+AND+programming)+AND+interface)&amp;OS=behavioral+AND+application+AND+programming+AND+interface&amp;RS=(((behavioral+AND+application)+AND+programming)+AND+interface)">User-defined coverage of media-player devices on online social networks</a><br />
In one embodiment, a method includes detecting, by a media-player device including multiple antennas, a client system of a user is within a wireless communication range of the media-player device. In response to the detection, the media-player device broadcasts an authentication key for the user of the client system. The media-player device then registers the user to the media-player device based on the authentication key being verified by the client system. The media-player device further receives from the client system instructions to adjust a power level of each of the multiple antennas. The instructions are determined based on broadcast signals received at the client system and on a respective position of the client system associated with each received broadcast signal. The respective position of the client system is determined with respect to a position of the media-player device.

A service session is facilitated via a packet switched network; in the service session, user equipment participates in an interactive communication exchange with an agent via a first interaction mode, and the interactive communication exchange is based on a user inquiry. The interactive communication exchange is monitored and a determination is made that a consultation service would facilitate resolution of the user inquiry. A service resource is associated with the service session responsive to determining that the consultation service would facilitate the resolution; the service resource provides consultation to the agent via a second interaction mode without exposing the consultation to the user equipment. The consultation elevates an experience level employed in the first service session towards resolution of the user inquiry.

In one embodiment, a method includes accessing user-concept scores for a first set of users, wherein each user-concept score is associated with a user-concept pair; calculating recommended user-concept scores for a subset of user-concept pairs in a second set of users. The first set of users may be discrete from the second set of users. A recommendation-algorithm may compute the recommended user-concept scores for a user-concept pair by optimizing an objective function comprising a plurality of predicted rating functions.

In some embodiments, settings associated with a user may be compared to provided media content when the user is within the detection region. The content may change when the settings conflict with the media content. Reminders may be provided to or directed to a plurality of users within the range of the media device.

 Signals representative of total photocharge integrated within respective image-sensor pixels are read out of the pixels after a first exposure interval that constitutes a first fraction of a frame interval. Signals in excess of a threshold level are read out of the pixels after an ensuing second exposure interval that constitutes a second fraction of the frame interval, leaving residual photocharge within the pixels. After a third exposure interval that constitutes a third fraction of the frame interval, signals representative of a combination of at least the residual photocharge and photocharge integrated within the pixels during the third exposure interval are read out of the pixels.

Systems and methods for call detail record (CDR) analysis to determine a risk score for a call and identify fraudulent activity and for fraud detection in Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems. An example method may store information extracted from received calls. Queries of the stored information may be performed to select data using keys, wherein each key relates to one of the received calls, and wherein the queries are parallelized. The selected data may be transformed into feature vectors, wherein each feature vector relates to one of the received calls and includes a velocity feature and at least one of a behavior feature or a reputation feature. A risk score for the call may be generated during the call based on the feature vectors.

<p>The why and how of behavioral for each of these technological approaches varies. However, it does provide a nice slice of the pie when it comes to the different angles of how behavioral approaches is being applied. I purposely left the company name off of each of these to make folks click in to see who is behind each one. I’ll spoil it a little, and say the usual suspects like Facebook are behind some of them, but others are behind these different ways in which technological is being used to understand and shift our behavior. Of course, for good. ;-)

<p>I’ll be doing more work to understand what is behind the intent of these patents. My concern around understanding more about how and what is considered behavioral in the API space is more about surveillance, than ever is about truly understanding what the good and bad of behavioral is. This is just the first of many patent searches that I will conduct. I’ll keep evolving my vocabulary for searching and discovering APIs in this area, evolving my results over time, and learning from what companies are up to when it comes to behavioral manipulation via APIs.
