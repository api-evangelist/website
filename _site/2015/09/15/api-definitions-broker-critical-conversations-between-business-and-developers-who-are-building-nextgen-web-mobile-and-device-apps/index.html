<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-business-dev-code.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />
<p>If  you are in an industry being impacted by technology, you have probably  become very aware of the term Application Programming Interfaces, more  widely known as APIs, and how they are driving web applications, mobile  applications, and increasingly everyday  objects in our homes, cars, businesses, and across the public  landscape. If you are finding yourself part of this growing  conversations, you have most likely have also heard talk of a new breed  of API definition formats that are becoming ubiquitous like Swagger  and API Blueprint.
<p>API definitions are a way to describe what an API does, providing a  machine readable blueprint of how to put the digital resource to work.  API definitions are not new, but this latest round of available formats  are taking the API conversation out of just  IT and developer groups, and enabling business units, and other key  stakeholders to participate throughout the API life-cycle. Much like the  latest wave of web APIs has made data, content, and other digital  resources like video and images more accessible,  API definitions are making APIs more accessible across the rapidly  expanding digital business landscape.
<p>The first widely available API definition format was the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl"> Web Services Description Language (WSDL)</a>, which is an XML format  established in 2001 that described web services. Much like web services  (an API predecessor), WSDL was a very technical vision of APIs,  something dictated by IT, and developer groups, with  heavy top down governance from business and industry leadership. While  web services, and WSDL are still ubiquitous across the enterprise, they  are rapidly being replaced with much lighter weight, simpler web APIs  that use the Internet as a way of delivering  the digital data, content, and resources web, mobile, and devices are  demanding in 2015.
<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-swagger-round-certified.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" />
<p>Along the way, newer, more web friendly API definition formats emerged, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Application_Description_Language"> Web Application Description Language (WADL)</a>, but ultimately WADL was  something that never took root, suffering from many of the same illness  of its predecessor WSDL. It wasn't until a new format called <a href="http://swagger.io"> Swagger</a> was born, that we started to see the conversation around how  we define, communicate and develop standardized tooling around APIs  evolve, providing an open specification for defining all the details  that go into an API.&nbsp;
<p>Swagger provided developers a way to describe an API that was more in  sync with everything else modern API developers were used to, including  using JSON, rather than the XML of previous web services, WSDL and  WADL. Swagger gave us something more than just  way to define APIs, it gave us swagger UI, which is a interactive  version of API documentation that made learning about what an API does,  and how to integrate with it, a hands on, interactive experience. This  new approach to documentation gave us a solution  to the number one problem plaguing API providers, which was out of date  documentation that confused consumers.
<p>Shortly after Swagger began seeing wide adoption because of the  interactive documentation it provided for APIs, a new API definition  format also emerged called API Blueprint, which provided interactive  documentation, but rather than using JSON, it used Markdown,  making the process of defining APIs a little less intimidating for  non-developers. Apiary, the makers of API Blueprint did another thing  that would move the conversation forward again, making the reasons for  defining APIs in these formats, more about API design,  than just about delivering up-to-date documentation.
<p><img style="padding: 10px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions2/bw-icons/bw-api-blueprint-icon.png" alt="" width="150" align="right" />
<p>Using API Blueprint, API designers could define an API, before any  code was actually written. Developers could craft an API using Apiary's  tooling, then a mock version of an API could be generated, which could  be shared with other project stakeholders, from  business users, to potential web or mobile developers. This process  saves considerable time, money, and other resources in ensuring than API  would be something web, mobile, and device developers could actually  put to use. With two new API definition formats  Swagger, and now API Blueprint, the processing of defining, designing  APIs in a machine readable way, was accessible to everyone, across a  rapidly expanding API life-cycle.
<p>This evolution has all occurred over the last 4 years, a period which  has also produced other API definition formats like RSDL, RADL, RAML,  I/O Docs, and MSON--just to name a few. All of these API definition  formats are quickly becoming the preferred format  for not just defining, and designing APIs, as well as delivering  documentation. Another positive by-product has been that a new breed of  API service providers are also using it as the central definition for  quickly putting their services to work on any API,  for documentation, mocking and virtualizing APIs, generating server  code, producing software development kits (SDK), and setting up  essential testing and monitoring to keep APIs stable and reliable for  consumers--the API definition driven life-cycle continues  to expand.
<p>In 15 years, like APIs, the API definition formats have moved out of  the real of the technical, and are providing vital business interactions  that ensure APIs meet critical internal, partner, and public needs.  They are also being applied to bring much needed  balance to the political side of API operations, from making sure APIs  are stable, and available, to defining pricing, rate limits, terms of  service, and even helping secure APIs that operate on the open Internet.
<p>API definitions have become a machine readable contract that defines  the boundaries of a relationship between API provider, and its  consumers. Acting as a central truth, that is crafted by developers and  API architects to govern how an API operates, from  mocking to client integration, but in a way that is also setting the  technical, business, and legal expectations of consumers. This API  definition-driven contact is transcending the often proprietary, black  box algorithms that make an API function behind the  scenes, providing a portable, shareable, machine readable contract that  can be shared internally, and externally with partners or the general  public.
<p>The importance of this new layer, and its role in the future of software development can be seen playing out in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_America,_Inc._v._Google,_Inc."> Oracle v Google API copyright case</a>, where Oracle (using the courts)  has set the precedent that the naming, and ordering of your interface is  separate from the code, and falls under copyright protection. Beyond  the core legal case, the questions, and understanding  of exactly what is code has been even more interesting. Many API  architects do not see APIs as anything but code, having not seen impacts  of the modern API definition movement within their architecture yet.
<p>API definitions aren't just about defining the URLs, parameters,  headers, and other aspects of API operations that developers need to  know, it is also bringing much needed clarity and awareness of value  generated by APIs among business users, and the end-users  of the applications that APIs are powering. API definitions provide a  common format in markdown, YAML, or JSON, that describe the technical  surface of an API, but then also take this technical specification, and  allow it to be applied across every stop along  the API life-cycle, from idea to deployment, to resulting integration  with web, mobile, and device applications.
<p>As APIs make their way into almost every aspect of our business and  personal lives, driving our social relationships with family and  friends, meter our connections to our utility companies, connect us to  educational and healthcare opportunities, this touch-point  between platform, and the web, mobile, and device applications it  powers, is becoming increasingly critical. To businesses this layer  represents critical supply chains, but to each individual this touch  point is where all of our life bits flow--further emphasizing  the importance of, but also the sensitivity required in defining APIs  in a meaningful way, that makes sense to EVERYONE involved.
<p>In 2001, a WSDL definition was very much about communicating what a  service did between platform and an the system that was integrated,  something that only involved IT, and developers. In 2015, a modern API  definition format provides the same benefits that  WSDL has historically delivered, but it is also addressing the  business, and political elements of how Internet enabled software works.  &nbsp;A modern API definition provides:
<ul>
<li>a medium for API designs, architects, and business stakeholders to  craft exactly the API that is needed, before any production code is  written. </li>
<li>a necessary set of instructions needed for a quality assurance (QA) team to make sure an API meets business requirements </li>
<li>a definition of sandbox, mocking, simulation, and virtualization environments that developers may need to be successful </li>
<li>what a developer needs to integrate with another system, or  build an application through interactive documentation, and even  complete Software Development Kits (SDK) </li>
<li>what the API testing, monitoring, and performance groups will need to ensure service level agreements are met or exceeded </li>
<li>the known surface area that security auditor will need to  properly secure the infrastructure web, mobile, devices, and ultimately  users will depend on </li>
<li>a map that government regulators can use to understand the  industry landscape, and help keep all players in alignment with the  nations priorities </li>
</ul>
<p>This is just a sampling of how API definitions are being used as a  driver for what is widely being called the API economy, which is the  heart of cloud, mobile, big data, Internet of Things (IoT), and almost  every other technical trend of the last ten years.  While API definitions provide the much needed machine readable  instructions for computers to understand what occurs at these vital API  touch-points, they also provide the much needed human readable  instructions, that people can use to interpret business agreements,  individual relationships, that are playing out across our increasingly  digital lives.
